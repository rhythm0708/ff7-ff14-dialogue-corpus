Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Yo! This your first time in a reactor?
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know."
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,The planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it every day.
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,It's the life blood of this planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the blood out with these weird machines.
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,I'm not here for a lecture. Let's just hurry.

Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Code deciphered.
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Push that button over there!
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Little by little the reactors'll drain out all the life. And that'll be that.
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,It's not my problem.
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"The planet's dyin', Cloud!"
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,The only thing I care about is finishin' this job before security and the Roboguards come.
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Push the [OK] button in front of a ladder to grab on to it. After that, use the [Directional button] to move up and down."
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"When we blow this place, this ain't gonna be nothin' more than a hunka junk.Cloud, you set the bomb."
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Shouldn't you do it?
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Jus' do it! I gotta watch to make sure you don't pull nothin'.
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Fine, be my guest."
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,......What's wrong?
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Huh?
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"What's wrong, Cloud? Hurry it up!"
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"...Yeah, sorry."
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Heads up, here they come!"
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Barret, be careful!Attack while it's tail's up!It's gonna counterattack with its laser."

Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,My leg got stuck.Thanks!
Biggs,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Let's go!
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Code deciphered
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Alright, be careful."
Biggs,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Code deciphered
Biggs,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,That should keep the planet going... at least a little longer.
Wedge,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Yeah.
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,.........
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,OK! Now everyone get back.
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"All right, now let's get out of here.Rendezvous at Sector 8 station! Split up and get on the train!"

Flower Girl,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Excuse me.What happened?
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"- You'd better get out of here- Nothing... hey, listen..."
Flower Girl,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Really? I don't know what's going on, but all right."
Flower Girl,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Oh, these? Do you like them? They're only a gil...?"
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,- Buy one- Forget it

Flower Girl,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"What! Tell me!Uh, excuse me, would you like to buy some flowers? They're only one gil."
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,- Buy one- Forget it
Flower Girl,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Oh, thank you!Here you are!"
Flower Girl,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Ahh... not again.
Redhead,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Just what the hell's going on!?
Man with Hat,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Wonder what that is on the wall over there. Let's see...Don't be fooled by Shinra! Mako energy doesn't last forever! Mako is the planet's lifesource! The end is in sight!Protectors of the planet: AVALANCHE
Soldier,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Hey! You there!!
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Shinra soldiers...- Fight them- Later!
Soldiers,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,What the?
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,hmph!

Soldiers,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Over here!!
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,hmph!
Soldier,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,That's as far as you go.
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,I don't have time to be messin' around with you guys.
Soldier,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Enough babbling...... Grab him!!
Wedge,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Cloud never came.
Biggs,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Cloud...... Wonder if he was killed?
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,No way!!
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Cloud......
Biggs,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Say, do you think Cloud's......Going to fight to the end for AVALANCHE!?"
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,The hell would I know!? Do I look like a mind reader?
Wedge,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Hey, Barret! What about our money...?"
(unclear),Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Uh, nothin' ...sorry."
(from outside),Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Ahhh......
Biggs,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Cloud!!
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Cloud......
Wedge,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Cloud!!
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Looks like I'm a little late.
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"You damn right, you're late!!Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene!"
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,It's no big deal. Just what I always do.
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Shi't!Havin' everyone worried like that you don't give a damn 'bout no one but yourself!
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Hmm...... You were worried about me!
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Wha!?I'm takin' it outta your money, hot stuff!Wake up!We're movin' out! Follow me!"
Wedge,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Hey, Cloud!! You were great back there!"
Biggs,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Heh heh...... Cloud! We'll do even better next time.
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Be careful, I'll shut this."
Shinra Manager,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy...
Train Bum,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Huh...? This is my house, so make yourselves at home."
Bald Man,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,You see the headlines in the Shinra Times?The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere in the slums....blowing up a Reactor... they sure put some thought into this one.They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll do next?
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Stop actin' like a damn kid. Si'down an' shu'up!
Biggs,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,It seems this train hasn't switched to security mode yet.I'm sure that will change by tomorrow....YAWN... that sure took its toll on me. I'm gonna sleep till we get to the station.
Train Worker,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Please!! You're bothering the other passengers.
Wedge,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous... and me, too!Cloud!!Don't ya think I got a bright future ahead of me?"
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,- What do you have in mind?- I wouldn't hold my breath
Wedge,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"All my life, I felt like nothin' but a sidekick.But after joinin' AVALANCHE and tryin' to save the Planet, I feel like I can do lots of things."
Wedge,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Oh man, that's pretty harsh, Cloud. You really think I won't?"
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Hey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me?It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it together. I'll explain it to you.I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors... you know, flashy stuff.Okay, it's about to start.This is a complete model of the city of Midgar.It's about a 1/10000 scale.The top plate is about 50 meters above ground.A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and there are other support structures built in each section...psst... whisper... whisper (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was in the northern section.)Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor.The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity.Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them.Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's the kind of place this is.Phew..., this is next! Look.This is the route this train is on.The route spirals around the main support structure.We should be coming around the center area, right now.At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up.It can check the identities and backgrounds on each and every passenger on the train by linking it up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters.whisper... whisper... (Anyone could tell that we look suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)"
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Speak of the devil...That light means that we're in the ID Security Check area....whisper... whisper... (When the lights go off, you never know what kind of creeps'll come out.)...anyhow, we're almost back now. That's a relief."
Wedge,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,I'm seein' stars. This sucks. I hate the dark.
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"I know! Next time, I'll give you one I made myself."
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,- Thanks anyway- Looking forward to it
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Oh yeah, you might regret it. I'm the type who takes things personal."
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Okay, then I'll put a little extra effort in and make it with a BANG."
Jessie,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"We're almost there. After talking with you, I really want to do it!I think you've lit my fuse!"
Biggs,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"...snore... heebeebeeheebee... snore... (Don't act so damn big, Barret... snooze...)"
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Look... you can see the surface now. This city don't have no day or night.If that plate weren't there... we could see the sky.
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,A floating city... Pretty unsettling scenery.
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Huh?Never expect ta hear that outta someone like you....you jes' full of surprises.The upper world... a city on a plate...It's 'cuz of that &^#$# 'pizza', that people underneath are sufferin'!And the city below is full of polluted air.On topa that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy."
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,Then why doesn't everyone move onto the Plate?
Barret,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,"Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe...'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets."
Cloud,Sector 1 - The No. 1 Reactor,I know... no one lives in the slums because they want to.It's like this train. It can't run anywhere except where its rails take it.
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Yo!! Get over here, all'ya!!"
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Yo, Cloud! You lissen up!"
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now.The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that explosion!Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that!Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!
Station Man,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"When you've been a train man as long as I have, you see a lot of people and a lot of lives.People meeting, parting, joy, sadness... After a while, it doesn't even get to you anymore.I wonder how long it's been... There's an invisible rail between me and the passengers.I could never live their lives. I'm just a train man plain and simple. It's easier that way.That's not to say that the crossing gate of my heart doesn't hurt now and again.Back during the war, I remember there was a lot of painful scenes then.But, that's a story for another day...First train leaves Midgar at 05:04am."
Guy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I'm not letting you go tonight.
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Wow!
Guy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Isn't there somewhere we could go to be alone?
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Wow!There's only the train graveyard around here. And they say there's ghosts around too!
Guy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,......damn.
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What?
Man by Fence,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Hey now!! Oops!!What on earth are you doing? Just butt out......geez!Huh? You came to see it, too?There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, everyone in the slums is dust...Well, there's no point in worryin' about that.Hey!! Look! It's huge, ain't it?"
Man by Fence,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Hey... This is a strange and wonderful place.This is my place, but you can come here when you want. Bye, bro!"
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Yo, Cloud! Over here, now!"
Soldier 1,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What the hell do you want? You know who I am?You can't pass. I got the miserable job of keepin' scum like you from trying to sneak in here.
Soldier 2,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"W, wow! You're great!!"
Soldier 1,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Damn right!! Don't waste time talkin's, what I always say!"
Soldier 2,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"But, uh, I......Ah... eh... uhm............ Excuse me. You cannot pass without the proper clearance.Did I do good this time?"
Soldier 1,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,You gotta be tougher!
Soldier 2,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"But, uh, I......"
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Heh heh...You wanna meet your little baby?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- Little baby?- Out of my way!
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Hey! Don' act like you don't know what I mean!I'm tellin' you...
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Heh! Jes calm down.Can't have people suspectin' us.
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Did you hear?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"- Don't care- No, what?"
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Oh, well excuse ME!"
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"There's a news update. They say that there was a terrorist explosion up above, and that this time it was a Mako Reactor!!You know what this means?"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"- Don't care- No, what?"
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Oh, well excuse ME!"
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Ya see, I keep on top of these things, an' if ya ask me......If you knock out Midgar's power, then all of its computers and signals are going to be knocked out too.Financially there must've been about a billion gil worth of damage.An' that ain't all!! A lotta innocent people got killed too!If the explosion had been in the middle of the night, that woulda been one thing. At least the people coulda gone in their sleep.This Mako explosion has really sent Midgar into a fit."
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Explosions! Explosions! Oh Man! AVALANCHE is so cool!
Johnny's Cousin,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Oh Jesus!! What the hell's wrong tonight!!I thought that long blackout was strange.They say a Mako Reactor was destroyed above.I was jes sittin' here drinkin', watchin' the news by myself.'n' all of a sudden I get kicked outta the &*%$ store. What's up with that!?I wasn't even done with my drink. I didn't even pay my bill..."
Johnny,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Woo...... ah geez, I'm blitzed. I jes love them homemade cocktails. But they sure do creep up on ya."
A sign to the far left,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Don't be taken in by the Shinra.Mako energy will not last forever.Mako is the life of the Planet and that life is finite.The end is coming.Saviors of the Planet: AVALANCHE
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What crappy handwriting. And look at all this graffiti!
Item Shopkeeper,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,(from inside)We're closed today. Come back tomorrow.
Black-haired Man,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Hey!! What the, YOU?Anyone talking to me must be a novice."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"- Yep, that's me- I used to be with SOLDIER, the name's"
Black-haired Man,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Don't act so big, amateur. Seein' as how I'm such a warm hearted guy, I'll show ya the ropes.You come back here tomorrow. I got some things I gots ta do."
Black-haired Man,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Hmmph!! Well, I never heard of ya!"
Big Man,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Unn......!! Who the hell are you!? No unauthorized access.Since today's special, I'm gonna let you in on a juicy bit of news. But you gotta keep it to yourself.Do you know what's been going on......?"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"- What, that again?- ............"
Big Man,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"I guess you must be sick of hearing it... But it's been so long since there was any real news here.You're worried where it's all heading, right?"
Big Man,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Everything's in a buzz 'bout that terrorist group AVALANCHE blowin' up the Sector 1 Mako Reactor.On the surface they say they're an anti-Shinra group, but in reality...They say they're just out to kill as many people as they can.Gyaaaa, Haaa haaa!!That's a good one, ain't it!? While they're bustin' things up on top, the only ones makin' out good are us weapon stores!Now, if we can just get rid of this back stock, we'll be doin' ok."
Man in Hat,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"You know what I do? I'll bet you don't.You come here tomorrow and I'll tell you.Ahh, there just ain't no good jobs here in the slums.I wanna go to the upper world."
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Ok! Go on ahead.You! Cloud!! Get off your slow-movin' ass!!
Marlene,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Papa!!
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Marlene! Aren't you going to say anything to Cloud?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- Yeah- Not this time
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"I should have known.He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in fights ever since you were little.I was worried."
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Hmm. You've grown up.When you were little you used to get into fights at the drop of a hat.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Flowers? How nice...You almost never see them here in the slums.But...A flower for me? Oh Cloud, you shouldn't have..."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,No big.- Give it to Tifa- Give it to Marlene
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Thank you, Cloud. It smells wonderful.Maybe I should fill the store with flowers."
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I'm so glad everyone's safe.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Sorry, Cloud. Marlene seems a little shy."
Marlene,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,............
Biggs,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Aaah!! Nothin' like that first drink after a job.Hic!!Why don't you have one too?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"- No- Yeah, why not?"
Biggs,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What!? You tellin' me you're too good to drink with me?Don't act big-headed jus' because you were in SOLDIER!
Biggs,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Oh!! That's more like it!!Even if you were with SOLDIER, you're still a rookie here. So you'd better listen to whatever I tell ya!"
Biggs,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Hic...!!Oh...... Don't tell Barret what I just said.
Wedge,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Oh, Cloud!Tifa really knows how to cook. Mmm, mmm......Anyway, let me tell you somethin'"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- About what?- I'm not interested in your stories
Wedge,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Tifa always lets me taste her cooking.And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly.Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good food and drinks that make this shop famous."
Wedge,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Cloud...... ......forget it.
Jessie,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Careless...... You're getting all excited.Wonder what for......?
Marlene,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Papa, welcome home!"
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Huh? Where'd you get that flower?
Marlene,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Cloud gave it to me.
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Oh......Did you thank him?
Marlene,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"............Thank you, Cloud.We'll take care of you."
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"You all right, Barret?"
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Great!!Get in here, fools!! We're startin' the meetin'!!"
Guy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Hey, come over here."
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,But people will...
Guy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Who cares?
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,But... There's a weirdo over there.
Guy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Huh?
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Did you hear?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- 'Bout what?- Don't care
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"About that little girl named Tifa and that bar called '7th Heaven'.I'm not only informed, I'm kinda nosey too. Anyhow, I got the scoop.You wanna hear?"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- You bet!- Don't care
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"That Barret and three of his henchmen are like this sometimes.Suddenly, they threw out a customer and start talking trash to him. It's strange, if you ask me. And that place always smells like gun powder.It's dangerous, I tell you. They must be doing terrible things in there."
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one!"
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one!"
Johnny's Cousin,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"There's a TV in there, but my cheap aunt won't let me in the house. Look for yourself."
Johnny's Mom,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,(from inside her house)I'm not opening up. Go away!!
Johnny,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Hey!! Open up! C'mon baby!!It's me! ! Mom!!
Johnny's Cousin,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Now that you mention it, there used to be an outside TV monitor here in the slums.But that Barret, busted it up.Shot it up with that weird machine gun hand of his. Blam, blam, blam.I think it was when President Shinra was on.He was on again this morning, too, you know.Tifa better watch out for her TV."
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"All's quiet!! Shh, I'm spying now!OH!! There's something!! DANGER!! ALERT!!"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Sit down.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,How about......something to drink?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- I don't feel like it- Give me something hard
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"OHH!!I can make a drink just as good as anyone else.Everyone says, my drinks taste the best!"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Just a minute. I'll make one for you.You know, I'm relieved you made it back safely."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What's with you all of a sudden? That wasn't even a tough job.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I guess not...You were in SOLDIER.Make sure you get your pay from Barret.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Don't worry. Once I get that money, I'm outta here."
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Cloud. Are you feeling all right?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,...yeah... Why?
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,No reason. You just look a little tired I guess.You'd better go down below.
Wedge,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,You think I'm a little too uptight?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- Yeah...- No...
Wedge,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"The next mission will be to blow up the Sector 5 Reactor.Cloud, you're great! Don't you ever get nervous?Or are you like, impervious to feelings? Naw, that couldn't be it."
Wedge,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Well, that's ok. Don't worry about me. I don't look like it, but I'm a coward at heart."
President Shinra,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,".........today the No. 1 Reactor was bombed. The terrorist group AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility for the bombing.It is expected that AVALANCHE will continue its reign of terror.But citizens of Midgar, there is no need to fear.I have immediately mobilized SOLDIER to protect our citizenry against this senseless violence. Thank you and good night."
Jessie,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Oops...Hey, look at the news... What a blast.Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was just make it like the computer told me.Oh no! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere.Hey, that was my bomb's debut. Makes me kinda proud."
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Yo, Cloud! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya.Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,None. I'm positive.
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,You sound pretty sure.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,If there was anyone from SOLDIER you wouldn't be standing here now.
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Don't you go thinkin' you so bad jes cuz you was in SOLDIER.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,............
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Yeah, you're strong.Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are.But don't forget that your skinny ass's workin' for AVALANCHE now!Don't get no ideas 'bout hangin' on to Shinra."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Stayin' with Shinra?You asked me a question and I answered it... that's all.I'm going upstairs. I want to talk about my money.
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Shucks!! ............money...
Marlene,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Papa, you're so great!"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Wait, Cloud!"
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Tifa! Let him go!Looks like he still misses the Shinra!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Shut up!I don't care about either Shinra or SOLDIER!But don't get me wrong!I don't care about AVALANCHE or the Planet for that matter!
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Straighten things up with everyone for me.
Jessie,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Money...Oh my. It must have been for a lot of it.Sure! Well, what the hell? It's a verbal agreement. Now let me figure this out.Oh stop it, Cloud! Did you hear me?"
Wedge,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"......Cloud.You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me.Cloud... You just want friends.Isn't that right?"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- Blow off- I really don't care
Wedge,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me.If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can always talk to me."
Wedge,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,You're terrible. Real cold blooded.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Listen, Cloud. I'm asking you. Please join us."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Sorry Tifa...
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,The Planet is dying. Slowly but surely it's dying.Someone has to do something.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,So let Barret and his buddies do something about it.It's got nothin' to do with me.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,So! You're really leaving!?You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood friend!?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What......?- How can you say that!- ......Sorry
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"(she says the same thing regardless)......You forgot the promise, too."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Promise?
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,So you DID forget.Remember...... Cloud. It was seven years ago...
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Look, the well.Do you remember?"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Yeah... back then.I thought you would never come, and I was getting a little cold."
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Sorry I'm late.You said you wanted to talk to me about something?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Come this spring... I'm leaving this town for Midgar.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,...All boys are leaving our town.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"But I'm different from all of them. I'm not just going to find a job.I want to join SOLDIER.I'm going to be the best there is, just like Sephiroth!"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Sephiroth... The Great Sephiroth.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,...I probably won't be able to come back to this town for a while.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,...huh?
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Will you be in the newspapers if you do well?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I'll try.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Hey, why don't we make a promise?Umm, if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind......You come save me, all right?"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What?
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Whenever I'm in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me.I want to at least experience that once."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What?
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Come on--! Promise me----!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,All right...... I promise.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"You remember now, don't you... our promise?"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I'm not a hero and I'm not famous. I can't keep...... the promise.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"But you got your childhood dream, didn't you? You joined SOLDIER.So come on! You've got to keep your promise......"
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER!A promise is a promise! Here!!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,This is my pay? Don't make me laugh.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What? Then you'll...!!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,You got the next mission lined up? I'll do it for 3000.
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What......!?
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"It's ok, it's ok.psst, psst...... (We're really hurting for help, right?)"
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Uh...... ugh...... (That money's for Marlene's schoolin'......)2000!
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Thanks, Cloud."
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Good Morning! Cloud!Did you sleep well?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"- Barret's snoring kept me up......- Next to you, who wouldn't?"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"psstpsst...(keep it down, they'll hear you. Barret's always edgy before an operation.)"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I don't know what you mean.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I'm going this time.
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first.I'll fill you in on the train.Yo! Cloud!Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you!I, uh,...... I don't really know how to use Materia!I'll give you that Materia you found. Just teach me how to use it!"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"...sigh...- Ok, I'll explain it- You wouldn't understand"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Sure, I'll explain how Materia works.First, access the menu.You know the basic functions.The triangle button brings up the menu.Directional buttons move the cursor,like this.Select each menu by using the OK button.If you want to leave the menu,just push the CANCEL button.See? Let's go ahead.Now you're in this menu.Select [Materia] sub menu.Select who you want to use it.Now look at my weapon here.Each weapon and armor has slots in it.Choose which slot you want to put Materia in.Now select the Materia you want to use.This is curative Materia.If you want to know what its effect is,line the cursor up with [Check],and push the OK button.It's just like selecting battle commands.Just line the cursor up to [Magic],you can see that the available magic has increased.Now you can use new magic [Cure].And that's all there is to equipping Materia.See? It wasn't that tough!When you want to remove any Materia,it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot,and pushing the triangle button.There's just one thing you have to be careful of.Whenever you equip Materia,your situation changes.Parts of you may become stronger...while others get weaker.Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia,your magic power will get stronger.But your physical strength weakens.So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword.On the left side of the screen,you can see the Materia's effect on you.It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia.But try out various things.Push the CANCEL button to exit the sub menu.Ok, that's about it.I'll give you some advanced tips later."
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Shi......! What's this 'It wasn't that tough!' crap!I'm clueless......Well, you handle the Materia then!"
Barret,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"So this is what makes them guys in SOLDIER so great, huh!?Ok. I'll ask Jessie again later. But you're in charge of the Materia!"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Cloud! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs.He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget!Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone!"
Marlene,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,All right!! Good Luck.Take care!
Item Shopkeeper,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Ahh... Another slow day......If this keeps up, this store's goin' under...Can't sell any really good medicine in a slum like this.Oh!! Look at this! This doesn't happen everyday. You a...... customer?Yes!! Welcome!! We sell! We buy!"
Weapons Shopkeeper,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"He, HEY! Waitaminit you!!You can't just walk outta here without buyin' somethin'...Might be unhealthy fer ya, if ya know what I mean."
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,You dried up old geez. You tired?Why don't you rest up on the third floor of my house?There's just one condition.You gotta give me some cash.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- 1 gil- 10 gil- nothin'
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Damn, man!! Just forget about it!"
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Oh man, oh man......Go ahead 'n' help yourself to the room."
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Cheap %#*^...
Black-haired Man,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Heh heh... He'll forget about it. OH, you!!Get my friend on the second floor to teach ya."
Big Man,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,This is the Beginner's Hall.You say you're a beginner? But your eyes say you're not.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Don't mess with me. I used to be in SOLDIER. I'll tell you how much I know... an' for free too!What do you want to know?- How to save?- How to heal your allies?- Curative Magic?- Weapons and armor?- How to apply Materia?- Effective ways to use Materia?- How to form your battle party?- How to check your status?- About Limit status?- Other things to watch for?- That's all
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Now I'll tell you about saving.You know what'll happen if you don't save?That's right.Everything you worked so hard to do will be lost!You never know when there might be a power outage.And you've got a long battle ahead of you.It pays to save oftenand take breaks when you need them.Anyway you'll need a Memory card to save your games.But, uh, none of the stores around here sell any.You'll have to get some at a (real) store.I guess you already have a Memory card.Put the Card firmly into the slot.Put it in either the right or left side.Then when you're ready, access the menu.Select [Save].Remember you can't just save wherever you want.You can only save at places marked [Save Point].When you find one, a message will appear.Whenever you reach a [Save Point],you'll want to save your game.Slot 1 is on the left,slot 2 on the right. Choose either one.Next, choose your file and save it.Each Memory card can hold up to 15 files.If you have files from other games on it,there will be less room to save.The screen only shows 3 files at a time so,press the directional buttons to scroll down the list,and you can see the rest.Remember, the more files you have,the longer it will take to load.One last thing.The Memory card is a delicate device.Be careful when handling it.Never remove it while saving or loading.Don't get mad even if you lose.If that happens, just chill out,and let your head, and your console, cool down.That's all.Remember to save often so you don't lose your games."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"For my explanation, I'll need a Potion."
Ghost,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Man, ex-SOLDIER's sure are cheap. OK, I'll GIVE you a Potion..."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"You probably already know this but...HP is your life force.If HP is lost in battle, you're out of commission.MP is the source of your magic power.If your MP's lost, you'll be unable to cast spells.So, what should we do to cure a damaged ally?There are three ways.First, you can rest at an inn at a nearby town.Second, you can use items to help them recover.Third, you can use curative magic.I'll explain about Magic later,but here we'll talk about items.Select [Item] from the menu.Potion restores HP.If you can't find where Potion is,access the menu and select [Arrange]to change the order of items.You can arrange them however you like.Order items you'll use in the field.Order items you'll use in battle.Prioritize items you can throw in battle.Order weapons and armor separately.Order by nameOrder by most items heldOrder by least items heldBy the way,[Key Items]'s are just that,items that unlock problems just like a key.They're very important items to have.Keep that in mind.Ok, now select [Use],Then select [Potion].Select the person you want to use it on.If they're already maxed out,you won't be able to use it on them.We can restore MP with [Ether].You use this the same way you did for [Potion].Just pick a member and use it!The number appearing next to the item nametells you how many are available.Of course, the more you use, the less you'll have.Some enemies will drop Potions or Ethers,but you'll want to stock up whenever you're at a store.One last thing, if someone in your party gets wiped out,either rest at an inn or use [Phoenix Down].That's all!"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Now I'll tell you how to use curative magic.First, access the menu and select [Magic].Next, select who'll cast the spell.Pick an ally equipped with [Restore] Materia.You can select another party memberby using the L1 and R1 buttons.The function also work in other sub menus.Better remember that.This is magic you can use,monsters you can summon,and enemy techniques you've learned.Whenever [Magic] is selected...the available magic appears on the screen...So, if you wanted to use [Cure]...you would select it from the menu...then select who you want to use it on.I think Potion is pretty expensive, so...when you're near an inn and you can restore MP,it's better to use curative magic rather than Potion.That's all."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Equipping weapons & armor is basic to battle.Let me show you how it's done.Just finding or buying new weapons or armor,isn't enough.You have to access the menu and select [Equip].Then, select who you want to equip.You can change weapons,armorand accessories.Accessories have special effects.Just select what you want to change.On the right side of the screen,here's a list of what can be equipped.You can see the item's effect here.Change your weapon with the OK button.Make sure it'll increase attack/defense levels.Pay special attention to Materia slots.The slots that are linked are effective.Also check the growth rates of Materia.Now when you want to remove an accessory...press the triangle button here.You should never remove weapons or armor.Because you never know when you'll be attacked.After you're finished equipping,you should re-equip your Materia.That's it!"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Materia can unleash hidden power in humans.So let's see how Materia is used.First, access the menu.Then select [Materia].Select who you want to use it.Pay close attention to my weapon here.Each weapon and armor has slots in them.Choose which slot you want to put Materia in.Now select the Materia you want to use.This is curative Materia.If you want to know what its effect is,line the cursor up with [Check],and push the OK button.It's just like selecting battle commands.Just line the cursor up to [magic],you can see that the available magic has increased.Now you can use new magic [Cure].And that's all there is to equipping Materia.See? It wasn't that tough!When you want to remove Materia,it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot,and pushing the triangle button.There's only one thing you have to watch out for.When you equip Materia, your condition changes.Parts of you will become stronger...while others get weaker.Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia,your magic power will get stronger.But your physical strength weakens.So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword.The left side of the screen,shows the effect of the Materia.Try out everything.And that's all.I'll tell you about some of the finer points next."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Access the menu if you find Materia.There's a lot of different Materia around.This is one of them. It's [All] Materia.If you equip this alone, nothing will happen.It's a little tricky, but I'll tell you anyway.Now look at my weapon.Look closely at those two slots.They're joined together as linked slots.You've got to remember to put it into linked slots.Different Materia will affect each other.But only if the slots are linked.Just to show you,let's put some [All] into one of the slots,and [Lightning] in the other.Now we can use [Bolt] on [All] the enemies.But it's limited to once per battle.Combine different thingsand you'll come up with different results.Combining [Restore] and [All],will let you use [Cure] for your entire party.There are also many useless combinations.For example, [Restore] and [Lightning][Bolt] and [Cure] can be used normally, butthere won't be any compound effect.Specialized Materia like [All] is called [Support Materia].You can tell the differencejust by looking at the Materia's color.This may sound weird, butdid you know Materia grows on its own?Even if one of your allies uses it,it will continue to grow with each battle.As its level increases,so will the effects of the magic you can use.I told you [All] works once per battle.But it can work twice or more as it grows.When you get it to the master leve,Materia will divide itself, looking like it's giving birth.But that master Materia won't grow anymore.When you can't take Materia on anymore,you'd better sell it or dump it somewhere.You can see the useful functions here.You can [Arange] Materia,[Remove all] Materia from your weapon.You can throw Materia into the [Trash].Oops, relax! I wasn't gonna dump it.Let's see. This is a special menu for you.You can exchange all Materia you have between allies,even if they're not in your party.Now about Materia's growth.The growth rate depends onwhat weapon or armor it's put into.Some will double in growth, while others won't grow at all.In most cases, the Materia's effect won't changewhether you put it into a weapon or armor.But [Elemental] and [Added Effect]are completely different depending on whetherthey're put into weapons or armor.You've got to think aboutwhat weapon or armor to use, orwhat Materia combinations will be the strongest.I remember hearing once...about extraordinary Materia somewhere in the world.I think I've told you just about everything I can."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"I'll explain your party's order in battle.First, access the menu and select [Order].Next, select who you want to switch.Now, select the position you want.This will change their position in battle.In this casethere isn't any advantage/disadvantage.But when you select the same person twice,it will place themin either the front/back row in a battle.When they're on the left side of the screen,that'll be the front row...When they're on the right,that'll be the back row.When you're in the front rowand you select [Attack]you inflict major damage on your enemy.But you will also receive greater damage.While in the back row,although you do less damage to the enemy,you also receive less damage.For magic attacks,there's no difference in damagebetween the front & back rows.There is also no differencewhen you use long range weapons.It's better to keep weaker members..."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"You must know your current status.That's one of the basics of battle.Access the menu and select [Status].Next, select the member you want to check.Were you surprised at the amount of information?I'll explain the order.First,these are your experience points and your level.The more experience you get in battle,the stronger you become.This gauge tells youhow many points you need to get to the next level.If you can't beat stronger enemies,raise your level by fighting weaker ones.You'll improve your physical and magical skills.Next is HP and MP.HP is your life force.When it reaches zero, you won't be able to fight.MP is the source of your magic power.Every time you cast magic, you use MP.and when you run out of MP,you won't be able to cast spells.This is called the Limit gauge.It shows your anger level.When the gauge is full, you can use a ""Limit Technique"".I'll tell you about ""Limit Techniques"" later.You know the battle commandsare classified roughly into two groups.[Attack] is for regular physical attacks.[Magic] and [Summon] cast magic attacks.Each has attacking power, defense power,and escape probabilities.The value depends on your equipment,and experience level.The total effect is on the chart below.These are commands you can use in battle.And your presently equipped weapons, armor,and accessories.Press the OK button here one more time.There are all types of attacks...Some monsters are weak against fire,others are weak against ice or lightning.The Materia or items you havecan add these [Elemental]s to your attacksor protect yourself from them in an enemy attack.This chart shows your current attributes.Press the OK button here one more time.The chart below means [Added Effect]s.Some enemies will use sneaky attacks on you.These attacks change your condition,such as...sleep, confuse, poison, darkness, petrify,silence, small, frog, and so on.These conditions disappear after each battle,except fury and sadness which will remain.To cure these conditions quickly,use items or magic.There are specific medicines for each condition.I know I'm repeating myself but,...when you're taken out in battle,I mean, when you're almost dead,use [Life] magic or the item [Phoenix down].When you change Materia or equipmentit's best to look here to check on them.Mastering Elementals and Added Effects...will make your battles safer.That's all."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Here are a few hints on limit techniques.When an enemy has pushed your anger to the limits,you can unleash unimaginable power.You know what I mean, right?The trick is how to use it.Access the menu and select [Limit].Now select a member.Now decide what your limit will be.Lower limits have less power,but you can use them more often.If you set your limit higher,you can inflict great damage,but you'll have to wait longer.After using this technique for awhile,you'll improve your technique.Your development will changedepending on how you fight.I can't tell you how it will change.That's something you'll have to find out by yourself.I've heard a rumor about secret itemsthat inspire ultimate techniques.I don't know whether or not those items really exist.That's it! Try everything out and use what's best for you!"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"You probably know all this. But just in case, I'll go over it.Until you get instructions, don't open or take discs out of the PlayStation.After you open up the Disc Cover, I can't guarantee what'll happen. That's all."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Huh? Finger!? What the hell?
Finger,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I'm the position cursor!! Call me whenever you're walking around confused!Push the [SELECT] button and I'll appear over your shiny little head.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Geez, you stand out even more than I do..."
Finger,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Am I in the way? If so, just push the [SELECT] button one more time.I'm pretty busy myself, and can't always come when you need me. If I don't show up sometimes, don't get mad.Later!"
Man in Hat,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Hey!! You got one right off!That was Materia. Next, take this [treasure chest]!"
Man in Hat,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Now listen, Hidden in these treasure chests, are a lot of itemsThere are box types and bag types, so make sure you don't overlook any."
Boy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,......smack......knock......!!
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Help!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,You've got to hang in there. You're limit gauge is just starting to build.
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Waaaah!!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Ok! Now your limit gauge is full, go ahead and use it! Fight with your limit technique."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Great!
Boy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Magic!! Magic!!
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Help!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Calm down! When your enemy uses magic counter with [Magic Barrier] or [reflect].[Magic Barrier] reduces the damage received from magic by half.[reflect] bounces the attacks off you. But the number of times you can use it is limited so be careful.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Great!
Boy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Wow! You sure are strong! I'm going to be strong, too!"
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Me too!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"If you want to get as strong as me you need to use Materia.And you have to find the best combinations of them.The type of Materia you put in your weapons and armor will determine how quickly your Materia grows.Put Materia into the open slots in your weapons and armor. The possible combinations are limitless.That's about all I can tell you. If you want to be like me, you have to have some natural talent."
Girl + Boy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I still don't get it!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Listen kid, don't piss me off!That's all right. Just give it a try. Little by little, you'll get used to it."
Three Guys Posing,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Hey SOLDIER!! Tell us about battles! We'll even pay you!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I'm not hard up enough to take money from guys like you. But I'll rap with you for a while.What do you want to know?- About ATB- The numbers on the screen- About [change] and [defend]- About [Escape]- About the gauges- About [status]- About [elementals]- About [help]- That's all the time I have for you!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"ATB or Active Time Battle is a system that is always in operation during battle.Select [Wait] from ATB on the Config Menu and time will stop when you select magic or items during battle.This gives you time to pick out your commands. This is especially helpful to beginners.Selecting [Recommended] ATB in the config menu can stop time while the effects of spells and items are taking place during battle.This lets you take your time looking over the progression of the battle. When you don't want to rush in battle, this is for you!Personally, I always use [Active], but you can use whichever you like."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,White numbers appearing on the screen in battle are damage points. Green numbers show restorative points.You better watch these if you don't want to get wiped out.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"The [change] command can move characters to and from the front and back rows.In the back row, the damage received is less, but the attacking power is less.You can make a [change] by pressing the Directional button in battle.Pushing the Directional button the other direction during battle accesses [defend].Selecting [defend] reduces the damage you receive by half until the next command.If you're up against a strong enemy, Don't hesitate to use this one. Of course, I never need it."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"I don't really remember ever having to use the [escape] command... but you'll probably need it.Push the L1 and R1 buttons at the same time, holding them down, and you can escape."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"During battle, there are several [gauges] displayed. You can't check them now, so just remember what I tell you.[time gauge] displays the time remaining until your next turn while in battle.When the gauge is full, you can make your command.If you don't want to make one, push the △ button and you can move to the next character.It's convenient when you wanna make Barret work.The [limit gauge] increases every time you sustain damage. When it is full, you can use the [limit technique].The gauge is not cleared after each battle, but gradually builds up over time.It takes a while for it to build up, so you have to think about which times are the best to use it.You probably don't know about it, but there are conditions of [status], [fury], and [sadness].When you have [fury], your limit gauge builds up sooner, but your attacking accuracy is lower.Keep in mind that [sadness] makes your limit gauge build up slower, but the damage you receive is also lessened.[barrier gauge] is for specialized magic.The top gauge displays [barrier] or magic defense against attacks. The bottom gauge displays [magic barrier] or defenses against magic attacks.Both will cut the damage you receive in half. However, over time they will disappear.Whenever you use [barrier] or [magic barrier] make sure to pay attention to the [barrier gauge].That's it. Remember that for the next battle."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"[status] means just that. The status of each character.I'll probably wind up repeating myself, but let me go over a few basic points.SleepYou cannot put in a command until you get up.PoisonSteals your HP in battle.FuryDamage is increased, attack accuracy decreased. Tranquilizers will remedy it.SadnessDamage is decreased. Hyper will remedy it.PetrifyWill petrify and become immobilized. Every member will be wiped out.ConfuseWill attack enemy and ally alike.SilenceWill be unable to cast magic.ParalyzeStops time gauges, commands.DarknessAccuracy of hitting attacks decreases.FrogBecome a frog. I hate this one!Hoo... I'm beat.[status change], since this can be changed with magic and items, you should check it whenever you buy things."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"[elemental] is the special effect that comes with certain weapons and magic.It's necessary to move ahead effectively. If you pay attention to the types of elementals you use you'll become intermediate in no time.I put together this list, but remember, it's just a partial list don't take it too literally.FireFire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters.IceIce effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold.LightningLightning effect. Works best on mechanical things.EarthAttacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies.PoisonPoisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison based enemies.GravityGravity based attack. These hurt if they hit.WaterCalls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters.WindCalls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies.HolyCalls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters.If you use reciprocal elementals in your attacks, the effect is huge!Also, if you use the same elemental, your defenses are raised. But, you have to be careful because the opposite is also true.To see what elementals an enemy has, you need [Sense] Materia. If you get that Materia, you should try using it."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Looks like you didn't get it the last time I told you. What's wrong with you? You touched in the head?Well, don't worry. You just need to push the [SELECT] button in battle.Do that, and the [help message] will walk you through the commands.It also shows you the name of your enemy, so even I use it once in a while. Make good use of it."
Woman by Save Point,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"This is the fabled [Save Point]!!At a [Save Point] you can use a [tent] and/or select ""SAVE"".There's more, too. Look for something called secret.Even if you are wiped out, if you save you can restart from that same point.That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out.This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar...Once you get the world map, you can save anywhere you like. Remember that."
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"This is a slum, so don't think you can stay for free.What are you going to do?Doesn't just seeing the bed make you sleepy?"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- 10 gil- no way
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Sweet dreams, pops."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,hoo...
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Tough guy, huh!? You'd better sleep when you can.You'd better save when you can.That's the trick to being tough. Remember that, old dude."
Johnny,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I'm leaving. Goin' faraway. But when I come back I'll be a better man! This is goodbye!Hey! Childhood friend! You better take good care of Tifa!
Johnny's Cousin,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I hope he doesn't get hurt.That worries me the most.
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Yesterday, everyone in town was peeking at the two of you from outside the bar.Tifa's childhood friend. That's a good one!"
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Ahh! Now I ain't got no one to pick on!
Johnny's Dad,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Ha! Ha!...... I wonder if my son's already left?When it's just my wife and I here, you have no idea how lonesome it gets.You want them to be happy and do what they want while they're young, but being a parent, you can't help but worry...I guess I'm not cut out to be a parent yet.By the way......Where are you from?"
Cloud,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,- A village called Nibelheim- Who cares?
Johnny's Dad,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Hm...... you said Nibelheim? Wasn't it in the news a while back?Something to do with a Reactor accident...That was the first major Mako accident, so I remember it really being a hot topic."
Johnny's Dad,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Ha, Ha!...... Well, there's nothin' wrong with that, I'd say.But if you still have a family, You outta at least write them.Even though you may turn your back on your hometown, It'll always be there for you.Least that's how I see it."
Johnny's Dad,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Well, you mind leaving the two of us alone?I want to enjoy some quiet time together with my wife."
Johnny's Mom,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"He used to give us nothing but headaches when he was here, but now that he's gone... I kind of miss him.......strange, isn't it?"
Kid,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,(standing by the door to 7th Heaven)When it comes down to it... I'm gutless. I'm still just a no good kid.
Gossip,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Listen! If there isn't anyone to listen, what's the use of getting gossip on everyone!?Yeah, and you Mr. I-don't-care!I'll get a little more information that would poque even your interest. You wait and see!"
Johnny's Cousin,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Ah... Johnny's gone. You look a little disappointed.I don't like to say it myself but, I'm just a lonely guy when I'm not drinking."
Soldier 1,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,HALT!! No one is allowed to pass!!
Soldier 2,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"You know, I got some tickets to ""Loveless"", do you want to go?"
Soldier 1,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"What're you, retarded? Midgar's under martial law now!"
Soldier 2,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"You mean, you really are concerned for me?"
Soldier 1,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Hell no!! But in case you forgot, we're in the middle of a slum.They could be anywhere around, so stay on your guard."
Soldier 2,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Right. You mean the AVALANCHERS?Don't you worry. SOLDIER has been added to the police force.Boy, it's been a while since SOLDIER's been mobilized, hasn't it?I ever tell you that I flunked the SOLDIER entrance exam?"
Soldier 1,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Damn right!! blahblahblah......Hey shut up for a minute and let me get back to work!
Soldier 2,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,............sigh.
Soldier 1,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,What are you more scared of... AVALANCHE or me?
Soldier 2,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Oh, you, of course."
Guy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,I've had it!
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Me too.
Guy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"You know this is the first time, we've ever agreed on something."
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Yes.....
Guy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Well then, shall we......?"
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,Yes......
Guy,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,urggh............
Girl,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,huff...... wheez
Station Man,Sector 7 - Seventh Heaven,"Morning. Dawn comes and things never change.You be careful not to get hurt. Come on back again, hear?ALL ABOARD! The train is about to depart."
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,YO!Looks like this ain't no private car!! So split up!!
Shinra Manager,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"...hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck..."
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"You say sumthin'?I said, 'you say sumthin'!?Yo, look at that!! It got empty alluva sudden.What's goin' on?"
Shinra Manager,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"DAMN!!I... it's empty because of... g, guys like you..."
Shinra Manager,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Y, Y, YIPES!!You... you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be more bombings.Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like today."
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,You workin' for Shinra?
Shinra Manager,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,I won't give in to violence... and I'm not giving up my seat either!
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Barret!!
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,&$#%!! You lucky ^$#^$.!
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"So, what are we gonna do now?"
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm...
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Seems like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally leaving.
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,So what's our next target?
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!Awright... I'll tell ya!Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security check point at the top plate.It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains."
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Which Shinra is very proud of.
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,We can't use our fake ID's anymore...
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,That means we've got only three more minutes to the ID Check point.
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train.Got it!?"
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Cloud, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor."
Train Bum,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Hmmm......? You're the only ones that'll talk to me or come to my house.I'm impressed.
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Yo, Mr. know-it-all, big time SOLDIER! You oughta know the area 'round the No. 5 Reactor, right!So let's hear YOUR explanation!"
Shinra Manager,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Waaaaah!!Don... don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man...!! I'm gonna brag to everyone at work about this...)"
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already...It's all right. Come a little closer."
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down.
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,What's happening?
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,What's goin' on!!
Jessie,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,We're in trouble.I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,^%#@%! Someone blew it...
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Let's go! Keep it up!
Train Bum,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Hm?... You'd talk to me even now?I'm really impressed. Let me give you a little something as a reward.
Train Bum,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"If I die in the gutter, use that to revive me, okay?"
Biggs,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Hurry!
Wedge,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"They're gonna lock the door, sir!"
Jessie,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Just run!Changing to Plan 2!
Passenger,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Hey... You guys are rowdy...Well, just calm down."
Kid 1,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Hyu----n!! Hyu----n!!
Kid 2,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Does this mean we're in a major bind?
Person,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Gosh!! You're adults, but you're making such noise.Please behave while you're in the train."
Dark-clothed Man,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Huh?The hell?!Do you want this?
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,- Yeah...- My mistake
Dark-clothed Man,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Wow! I won't even charge you...Wha-t? Don't get used to it though.
Dark-clothed Man,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Wha-t? You sure are greedy.
Dark-clothed Man,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Wha-t? Let me know when you need me.
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Awright! We clear!?
Jessie,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Not yet. They're starting another check. If we're caught, we're done for!But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should get past it!"
Thief,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Hee hee!!
Thief,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,...nowhere to run...By any chance...Busted?
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,- Huh...?- That's right
Thief,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Ok, then. That's that."
Thief,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,I'm so--- sorry. I'll give it back.
Johnny,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Later... Goodbye... Adios, Midgar!!sob..."
Man Lying on Floor,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,urrrrrrg
Naked Man 1,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Brrrrr......It's terrible. Who'd expect underwear bandits in this day and age?They wiped me out!
Naked Man 2,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Any idea what happened?All I know is, when I woke up the 3 of us were butt-naked!But I guess you couldn't relate..."
Naked Man 3,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,That scary broad made me take the bomb.Of course I couldn't very well refuse her!
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,All right!! We made it!Yo!! This way!!Let's go!! We're gonna dive outta here!!
Wedge,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Guess who? It's me, !Looks like things were a success.I look just like my little brother in these clothes...I wonder how everyone's doin' now...?"
Jessie,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"It's me, . How do I look, Cloud?Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?"
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,- Yeah...- Not now
Jessie,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Yay!! I'm so happy ...I think?
Jessie,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"You're right, sorry."
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,...Scary... huh.
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Too late to be saying that now. Why'd you come along anyway?
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Because...
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Hey you two! There ain't no time for that!Yo!! Ain't no time to waste!!...do something!
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Yeah!! I've made up my mind!Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!!
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,You don't care if I go first?
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"A leader always stays till the end.Don't worry 'bout me, just go!Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt!It's only the beginnin' of the mission!"
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Later! You take care of the rest!
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"C'mon!! Hurry your slow ass up! That's it, huh?"
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Oh well...
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,We're gonna jump outta here!! Follow me!!
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,We got a lot of battles ahead of us. This's going to be tough.
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Oh man...... We were forced to get this far out.We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on.Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!"
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,What? That's it!?
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,That didn't do anything!
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"We'll jump from here!! Follow me, you 'spensive leech!!"
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Phew-----! Be strong!
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Oh man...... We were forced to get this far out.We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on.Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!"
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,The hell!? So this is as far as we go...?
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,We were almost there.
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,We're gonna jump off here!! Follow me!!
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Don't worry! Don't worry!
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"That was close. I thought we were gonna get caught...They probably don't realize that we've sneaked in yet. We should get to the reactor in no time.Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!"
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Good, so far everything's going as planned.Better not let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 reactor.Biggs, Wedge and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it.Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!"
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Those light beams are the Shinra's security sensors. We can't go any further.After coming this far, only an amateur'd get caught by the security sensor."
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that to get under the Plate? No way!Yo, Cloud, what're we gonna do?"
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,- Look inside closely- Go down- Don't go down
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,...There seems to be nothing that'll get us stuck in this duct.
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Yeah. If we go down this duct, we won't be able to come back up here."
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Don't be wastin' time. Never know when the Shinra'll find us.Cloud you jes' gotta go.
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,- Go down- Don't go down
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"But, damn man, that thing gives me the chills."
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Whaddya mean we're not goin' in? There ain't no other way of gettin' to the Sector 5 reactor 'cept through here.
Wedge,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Cloud, this way. The reactor's up this ladder."
Jessie,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"I'm sorry.The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault.I made your ID card special...... So that's why it happened...I put my heart into making it. But I failed.Next time, I'll give you something more decent.I'll be back at the hideout in my research room workin' on it."
Biggs,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout.Cloud, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor!"
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Papa...Sephiroth!?Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything!I hate them all!"
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Damn man, get a hold of yourself!"
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,You all right?
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,......Tifa.
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Mmm?
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"No... forget...... Come on, let's hurry!"
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Damn straight.Tifa's old friend... That ain't good enough.
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Jessie said we all have to push the buttons at once.
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,No good. Let's try it again.
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,This way!
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,...a trap...
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Presi... President Shinra?
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Why is the President here?
President Shinra,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Hmm... So you all must be that... ...what was it?
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! And you're President Shinra, huh?"
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Long time no see, President."
President Shinra,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"...Long time no see? Oh... you.You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew you'd been exposed to Mako, from the look in your eyes...Tell me, traitor... what was your name?"
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,.
President Shinra,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember each person's name.Unless you become another Sephiroth.Yes, Sephiroth... He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant..."
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Sephiroth......?
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place's goin' up with a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!
President Shinra,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin like you..."
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"VERMIN!? That's all you can say... VERMIN!Y'all Shinra're the VERMIN, killing the planet! And that makes you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!"
President Shinra,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"...You are beginning to bore me.I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me... I have a dinner I must attend."
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!
President Shinra,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all."
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,!? What's that noise?
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,The hell is this!?
President Shinra,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Meet 'Airbuster', a techno-soldier. Our Weapon Development Department created him.I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be of great use to us in future experiments."
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,...Techno-soldier?
President Shinra,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Now then, if you'll excuse me."
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Wait, President!"
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Yo, Cloud! We've gotta do somethin' 'bout him!"
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Help, Cloud!THIS is from SOLDIER?"
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,No way! It's just a machine.
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,I don't care what it is!! I'm gonna bust him up!
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"It's gonna blow! Let's go, Tifa!"
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Barret! Can't you do something?
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Not a damn thing.
Tifa,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Cloud! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much I want to tell you!
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"I know, Tifa......"
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Hey, you gonna be awright?"
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,- (Be strong)- (I don't know if I can hold on...)
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,...Alright. Sorry 'bout all this.
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Stop talkin' like this is the end!
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for ya. Ya gotta do it yourself.
Cloud,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,Barret...
Barret,Sector 4 - The No. 5 Reactor,"Alright, then, later."
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,Oh! It moved!Whew... Am I glad.
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Hello, hello?"
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Hello, hello!"
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,You okay?This is a church in the Sector 5 slums.It suddenly fell on top of me. It really gave me a scare.
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,......I came crashing down?
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall. You're lucky.
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,Flower bed...... is this yours?
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,"That's all right. The flowers here are quite resilient because this is a sacred place.They say you can't grow grass and flowers in Midgar.But for some reason, the flowers have no trouble blooming here.I love it here."
Reno?,Sector 5 - Aeris,I'll give you a little more time.
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,"......So, we meet again.......Don't you remember me?"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,"- Yeah, I remember you......- Never saw you before"
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,Oh! I'm so happy!Thanks for buying my flowers.
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Excuse me, but that's really rude!I don't remember a thing.But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me."
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,"......I guess you don't remember. You were walking in a daze.But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me."
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Say, do you have any materia?"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Yes, some.Nowadays you can find materia anywhere."
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,But mine is special. It's good for absolutely nothing.
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,......good for nothing? You probably just don't know how to use it.
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,"No, I do...... it just doesn't do anything.I feel safe just having it. It was my mother's......Say, I feel like talking. Do you feel up to it?After all, here we are meeting again, right?"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,- I don't mind- Got nothing to talk about
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,Wait here. I've got to check my flowers. It'll just be a minute.
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,"......oh, I see.Ahhh. I wonder whose fault that is. It takes a lot to grow them, you know. Poor flowers."
Flower Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Just a little longer.Oh!Now that you mention it......We don't know each other's names, do we?My name is......I'm Aeris, the flower girl. Nice to meet you."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,The name's .Me......? I do a little bit of everything.
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,Oh...... a jack of all trades.
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Yeah, I do whatever's needed.What's so funny? What are you laughing at?"
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,Sorry...... I just
Reno,Sector 5 - Aeris,Don't worry about me.
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Say, Cloud. Have you ever been a bodyguard?You DO do everything, right?"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,"......Yeah, that's right."
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Then, get me out of here. Take me home."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,"OK, I'll do it... but it'll cost you."
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Well then, let's see......How about if I go out with you once?"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,"I don't know who you are, but......You don't know me......?"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,Oh yeah...... I know you.that uniform......
Soldier,Sector 5 - Aeris,"......Hey sis, this one's a little weird."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,Shut up! You Shinra spy!
Soldier,Sector 5 - Aeris,Reno! Want him taken out?
Reno,Sector 5 - Aeris,I haven't decided yet.
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,Don't fight here! You'll ruin the flowers!
Reno,Sector 5 - Aeris,"They were...... Mako eyes.Yeah, all right. Back to work, back to work."
Soldiers,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Hey Reno, you just stepped on them!They're all ruined!You're gonna catch holy hell!"
Reno,Sector 5 - Aeris,"There they are, over there!"
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,Cloud... that one!
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,I know. Looks like they aren't going to let us go.
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,What should we do?
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Well we can't let them catch us, can we? Then, there's only one thing left."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,All right. I'll hold them off.
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,Right. Make sure they don't get through!
Reno,Sector 5 - Aeris,The Ancient is getting away! Attack! Attack! Attack!
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,Eaygh!!
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,Aeris!
Reno,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Think we killed 'em? They shouldn't have put up a fight, I say!"
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Cloud, help!"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,Damn!
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"A, all right."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,Here's a barrel. If I can just push it over......Push the barrel?- Yes- No
Soldiers,Sector 5 - Aeris,Guuagh!Nwahh!Urkkk!
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Thanks, Cloud."
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Oh, Cloud what are you doing!?"
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"A, all right."
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"A, all right."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Aeris, this way."
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Ha, ha...... They're looking for me again."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,You mean it's not the first time they've been after you?
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,...no.
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,They're the Turks.
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,Hmmm......
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,The Turks are an organization in Shinra. They scout for possible candidates for SOLDIER.

Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"A girl!! What do you mean by that!?You expect me to just sit by and listen, after hearing you say something like that!?Mom! I'm taking Cloud to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while."
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris,"But dear... I give up. You never listen once you've made up your mind.But if you must go, why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late now."
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Yeah, you're right, mom."
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris,"Aeris, please go and make the bed."
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris,"That glow in your eyes... you're from SOLDIER, right?"

Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,...Not really.
Cloud's Mom,Sector 5 - Aeris,...I'm worried about you.There are a lot of temptations in the city...I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice girlfriend.
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,...I'm all right.
Cloud's Mom,Sector 5 - Aeris,"You should have...an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you.I think that would be the perfect type for you."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,......I'm not interested.
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris,...I must've fallen asleep.Sector 7's past Sector 6... I should be all right by myself...

Cloud,Sector 6 - Wall Market,- See her home- Take her to Sector 7
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,Isn't that a little out of the way?
Cloud,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Yeah, I guess so."

Johnny,Sector 6 - Wall Market,Aeris...... Thanks for the flower and 1 gil.I'll treasure this! I'm going to dry it and keep it for good luck.
Redhead in Suit,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"I bought some pretty flowers from Aeris.500 gil, a little expensive. Well, at least I got her name."
Punk,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"I asked Aeris for a date...And she said not even if I paid her 1,000,000 gil.Her flowers cost 300 gil, too... She's a good business woman."
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,Excuse me! I'd like to get a dress.
Shopkeeper's Daughter,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Umm, it might take a little time. Will that be all right?"
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,What's the problem?
Shopkeeper's Daughter,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You see, he makes all the dresses."
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"And, where is your father?"
Shopkeeper's Daughter,Sector 6 - Wall Market,He's probably plastered at the bar.
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,So... You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something about your father?
Shopkeeper's Daughter,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Yes, I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble.!You'd help me bring him back?"
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Well, if we don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?"
Shopkeeper's Daughter,Sector 6 - Wall Market,Really!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what to do anymore...
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"All right, we'll do something. Let's go, Cloud!"

Cloud,Sector 6 - Wall Market,We couldn't find him yet.
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?"
Clothing Shop Owner,Sector 6 - Wall Market,I own the Clothes Shop... but I ain't your father.
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,I didn't say that......
Cloud,Sector 6 - Wall Market,Make me some clothes.
Clothing Shop Owner,Sector 6 - Wall Market,I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin' anything right now.
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Cloud, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and talk to him.Why don't you go over there and have something to drink."
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"You know, Mister.He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up like a girl.So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him..."
Clothing Shop Owner,Sector 6 - Wall Market,What!? A tough lookin guy like that?
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?"
Clothing Shop Owner,Sector 6 - Wall Market,...might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just makin' regular clothes.
Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,Then you'll do it for us?
Clothing Shop Owner,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?"

Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!"
Clothing Shop Owner,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"So, how was it? Were you able to see him?"

Redhead in Suit,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Sir, is everything all right? Look, Aeris looks so lonely.

All items obtained, there is nothing for it but to return to the dress shop...
Clothing Shop OwnerLooks like you're all set. Now try it on, and let's see how it fits.
Shopkeeper's DaughterLooks like you got it. So try it on for size.
AerisAren't you going to change?
Cloud- Okay... I'm ready- Not now
Cloud changes in the dressing room and steps out.
Clothing Shop OwnerHmm, not bad. This may be a new business for me.
Shopkeeper's DaughterYeah, you're right. Should we try it?Thanks for showing us something new. My father's got his motivation back now, So the dress is on the house.
AerisWalk more nicely like... this. Miss Cloud.
Cloud...What do you mean 'nicely'?
Cloud walks primly around the room.
AerisOh you're so cute, Miss Cloud.Aaah, I want one. Do you have one that'll look good on me too?
Shopkeeper's DaughterHow's this?
Clothing Shop OwnerHow about that one?
Shopkeeper's DaughterFather, what are you talking about? This one's much better.
Clothing Shop OwnerNo, what are you saying? This one.
Aeris...I want THIS one.
Shopkeeper's Daughter + Clothing Shop OwnerHuh?
AerisI'm going to go change.
She walks to the dressing room, then turns to look at everyone.
......No peeking!
Everyone stares at the curtain while she changes, and after a few moments she emerges in a red dress with her hair down.
AerisSo? How do I look?
Cloud just shakes his head.
AerisOh, you're no fun!
Shopkeeper's Daughter (to Cloud)...Hmm. It's REALLY somethin'.
CustomerYou're...Weird.
Clothing Shop OwnerHmm, good. It looks good on you.
They leave the dress shop and can now wander around a bit without being recognized. If Cloud tries to leave Wall Market, Aeris hangs back.
CloudWhat's wrong, Aeris?
Aeris...What is it? Are you going outside like that? I mean, that's okay with me, but...
Cloud...Oh, yeah.
AerisGet a hold of yourself, Ms. Cloud.
PunkHey! Pretty lady. Let me tell you about a good job!Go to the Don's place. You'll make a small fortune!
Outside the Honey Bee Inn...

Or:

Or:
Hmm, pretty good.

And finally... off to Don Corneo's mansion...
DoormanDamn!! Your friend's hot, too!Come in, come in!!Two ladies coming through!!
The door opens, and Cloud and Aeris walk through.
Hey, ladies.I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't go wandering around...
AerisNow's our chance. Let's find Tifa.I wonder where she is...
Of two doors upstairs, one is closed, and the other reads ""Office of The Don Corneo Keep Out!"" Aeris and Cloud go down a long set of stairs to the basement, where they find Tifa. When Cloud sees her, he turns away. Aeris goes over to talk to her alone.
Aeris...Tifa?Nice to meet you. I'm Aeris.Cloud's told me a lot about you.
Tifa...And you are?Hey you're the one with Cloud in the park...
AerisRight, with Cloud.
TifaOh......
AerisDon't worry. We just met. It's nothing.
TifaWhat do you mean, 'Don't worry'... about what?No, don't misunderstand.Cloud and I grew up together. Nothing more.
AerisPoor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call him nothing.Right, Cloud?
TifaCloud?
If Cloud tries to run away upstairs, Aeris comes after him.
AerisEmbarrassed? Come on, speak up!
If Cloud tries to talk to Aeris, she just laughs. Cloud walks up to Tifa, head down.
Tifa????
She peers at him and then jumps several feet in the air.
Cloud!?Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?Forget that, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you hurt!?
CloudHey, give me a chance to answer.I'm dressed like this...... because there was no other way to get in here.I'm all right. Aeris helped me out.
TifaOh, Aeris did...
CloudTifa, explain. What are you doing in a place like this?
TifaYeah, ummm......
AerisAhem!! I'll just plug my ears.
She walks a short distance away and puts her hands to her ears.
Please, go on with your private conversation.
If Cloud tries to run away upstairs, Aeris comes after him again.
AerisHey, what's the secret?
Tifa...I'm glad you're OK.
CloudThanks. What happened?
TifaWhen we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird man.So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him.
CloudThat's when the Don's name popped up.
TifaRight, Don Corneo.Barret told me to leave the lech alone...But something's been bothering me.
CloudI see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's mouth.
TifaSo I made it here, but now I'm in a bind.Corneo is looking for a bride.Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then... ...and, well......Anyway, I have to be the girl... or I'm out for tonight.
AerisSorry... but I overheard...If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?
TifaI guess so, but...
AerisWe have two here, right?
CloudNo, Aeris! I can't have you get involved.
AerisOh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?
CloudNo, I don't want Tifa in...
TifaIs it all right?
AerisI grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger.Do you trust me?
TifaYes. Thanks, Ms. Aeris.
AerisCall me Aeris.
He---y!!It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting!I told you not to wander around... I tell ya, women nowadays...Hurry up, will ya!
CloudI probably don't need to ask but the other girl is......Me...... right?
TifaYou're right, there was no need...
Aeris...to ask.
TifaHa ha... You know, if you look closely, you're not so bad...I wonder what Barret would say if he could see you now...
AerisThey're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.
The three of them head back upstairs.
The Don's waiting in his room... Ha ha ha...
They enter Don Corneo's office, where he is seated at his desk, flanked by two lackeys.
KotchAll right, ladies!Line up in front of the Don!
Cloud, Aeris, and Tifa line up in front of the desk, and Corneo jumps up.
Don CorneoHmmm! Good, splendid!
He walks to Aeris.
Now, let's see... Which girl should I choose? Hmm---hmm---!
He walks to Cloud, who turns his head.
This one?
He walks to Tifa.
Or this one?Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!!My choice for tonight is......
Depending on the items collected for Cloud's disguise, Don Corneo will choose one of the three.

Tifa
Aeris
Cloud

Corneo walks to Tifa.
Don CorneoThis little beauty!
TifaFu, fu, fu... Be nice, Don.
Corneo turns to his lackeys.
Don CorneoYou can have the other ones!
Kotch + ScotchYes, sir! Thank you sir!
Don CorneoWell then, shall we go my pretty!?
He starts for his bedroom and Tifa follows. After a scene change, Cloud ends up in the basement with a bunch of guys.
ScotchHey guys! We've got guests.We'll take REAL good care of you.This is all thanks to the big boss, Don Corneo!
MenHeeey!! Three cheers for Don Corneo!!
ScotchHeh, heh... Well ladies, are we, uh, all ready?...leer...snicker...
 (by the door)Whoa!Slow down, what's the hurry? Why don't you stick around... We'll treat you real nice!
The men crowd around Cloud with arms outstretched like zombies.

I gots ants in my pants wanna do a dance, gotta take a chance and mebbe find romance!Come on, dance with me, beautiful. They say if two people dance together, their hearts will become one, also...Hey... you're in pretty good shape. Lookit your tight little bod......No, it's more like... muscles...
ScotchHey... what's wrong? You want me to keep you company?
CloudNo... I'm flattered, but no thanks.Because...
ScotchBecause......?
CloudBecause...I ain't INTERESTED in a buncha scrubs like you!!
Cloud takes off the dress, revealing his usual uniform underneath.
ScotchWha... a MAN!???God damn it! You think you can get away with this! Get him! Knock the crap out of him!!
Cloud fights off three of Corneo's lackeys.
ScotchGrr! C'mon, what's the matter with you good for nothings!?All right now, COME ON! I'll show you how it's done!!
Cloud dispatches Scotch and the other two lackeys. He then hurries back towards the other basement room, where Kotch is chasing Aeris around.
AerisNo---!!
KotchHa ha ha... Wait you!!
Aeris runs up the steps towards Cloud, then turns around to give Kotch a shove.
AerisI'm so sorry!!
Kotchoh, oh, oh......
He falls down the stairs.
heh, heh, heh...!!
CloudAeris!!- You all right?- We gotta help Tifa!

You all right?
AerisI told you. I'm used to danger.To tell you the truth, my heart was pounding!


We gotta help Tifa!
AerisYe... yes, you're right... ......let's hurry!

Kotch (lying at the bottom of the stairs)C'mon... just once... I won't tell... I promise!I just wanted to act like I got a cute girl...Cute!!
In Corneo's room, Tifa is sitting on the edge of his bed while he sits leering at her.
Don CorneoWoo-hoo!Come, come, don't be so shy...
TifaI know......But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something before we start...
Don CorneoHm? Oh, you mean about THAT?Don't worry. I'm single. There, feel better now?
TifaNo... I'm not asking about that......Wa... wait a minute! No, not yet!!
Don CorneoCome! Come!Aooooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!
Cloud and Aeris run in.
TifaCloud!!
Tifa jumps up as Corneo leaps for her, and he lands on his face.
Don CorneoWha... what the hell? Who goes there!?
TifaYou still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?
Don CorneoGet what?
[skip to the interrogation]

Corneo walks to Aeris.
Don CorneoThis slender little girl!
AerisDon, you've got great taste.
Corneo turns to his lackeys.
Don CorneoYou can have the other ones!
Kotch + ScotchYes, sir! Thank you sir!
Don CorneoWell then, shall we go my pretty!?
He starts for his room and Aeris follows. After a scene change, Cloud ends up in the basement with a bunch of guys.

AerisYe...yes...But Mr. Don. I'd like you to explain something to me first...
Don CorneoOf course, my dear. I'll take you through it slowly, step by step. So come on!
AerisNo, that's not what I meant!NO, STOP! Just, just wait a second!!
Don CorneoCome! Come!Aooooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!
Cloud and Tifa run in.
AerisCloud!!
Aeris jumps up as Corneo leaps for her, and he lands on his face.
Don CorneoWha... what the hell? Who goes there!?
AerisI'm sorry, Don.
Don CorneoGet what?
[skip to the interrogation]

Corneo walks to Cloud.
Don CorneoThis healthy-looking girl!
CloudWa, wait a sec! I mean, uh, please wait a moment!
Don CorneoWoo-hoo!I love chickies who play hard-to-get! Yeowza!
Corneo turns to his lackeys.
Don CorneoYou can have the other ones!
Kotch + ScotchYes, sir! Thank you sir!
Don CorneoWell then, shall we go my pretty!?
After exchanging glances with Tifa and Aeris, Cloud reluctantly follows Corneo into his bedroom.
Don CorneoAhh, we're finally alone...All right, pussycat... Come to daddy!!
If Cloud tries to run away...
Don CorneoWoo-hoo!Don't be shy. We're all alone now...
Cloud approaches the bed.
Don CorneoYou're so cute, I never get tired of looking at you.Do you... like me, too?
Cloud- Of course!- Ummm......

Of course!
Don CorneoYou sure do know how to make a guy feel good!Then, wh... what do you want to DO?
Cloud- Whatever YOU want, daddy- Don't really care......

Whatever YOU want, daddy
Don CorneoOh man! I can't stand it! All right, then......Give me a kiss!! A KISS!!
Cloud- All right......- Nope, can't do that......

All right......
Cloud walks over and leans forward to kiss Corneo, not quite touching lips. He shakes his head and tries again.
Aeris or TifaJu---st a minute!!
Don CorneoWha... what the hell? Who goes there!?
TifaCloud...Were you really......
Cloud shakes his head violently and takes off the dress.
Don CorneoA man!? What's goin' on?


Nope, can't do that......
CorneoWhy? WHY? WHY?
CloudBecause...Because I'm gonna have to use that mouth of yours to give me some information!!
Cloud takes off the dress.
Don CorneoA man!? You tricked me!!Somebody get in here NOW!!
Tifa or AerisUnfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help.
Tifa and Aeris come running in.
Don CorneoYou're the ones from before! Wh... what the hell's going on?



Don't really care......
Don CorneoYou don't like me?There... there isn't someone else, is there?
Cloud- No, only you- Yes, his name's Barret...

No, only you
CorneoYou sure do know how to make a guy feel good!Then, wh... what do you want to DO?
Cloud- Whatever YOU want, daddy- Don't really care......


Yes, his name's Barret...
CorneoNo way!Hmm? Barret? That sounds familiar...
CloudYou know, he's one of the ones you were trying to find out about. You know, AVALANCHE...?
Don CorneoOh, yeah, yeah. In Sector 7 in the slum......and how do YOU know that!?
Cloud takes off the dress.
Don CorneoA man!? You tricked me!!Somebody get in here NOW!!
Tifa or AerisUnfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help.
Tifa and Aeris come running in.
Don CorneoYou're the ones from before! Wh... what the hell's going on?




Ummm......
Don CorneoYou don't like me?There... there isn't someone else, is there?
Cloud- No, only you- Yes, his name's Barret...

TifaShut up, we're asking the questions now...What did your assistants find out? Talk! If you don't tell us...
Cloud...I'll chop them off.
Don CorneoNo! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!
TifaSo... talk.
Don Corneo...I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But that's what I was ordered to do.
TifaBy who?
Don CorneoNo--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!
TifaTalk! If you don't tell us...
Aeris...I'll rip them off.
Don CorneoWaaaaaaaaaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra!Heidegger, the head of Public Safety Maintenance!
CloudThe head of Public Safety Maintenance!?
TifaDid you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk!If you don't tell us......I'll smash them.
Don Corneo...You're serious, aren't you... ...ohboy, ohbooy, ohboy....I'm not fooling around here either, you know.Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout.And they're really going to crush them... literally,By breaking the support holding up the plate above them.
TifaBreak the support!?
Don CorneoYou know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PINGand everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums...I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6.
TifaThey're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?Cloud, will you come with me to Sector 7?
CloudOf course, Tifa.
They all start for the door.
Don CorneoJust a second!
CloudShut up!
Don CorneoNo wait, it'll only take a second.How do you think scum like me feels when they babble on about the truth?
Cloud- They've pretty much given up on life- They're sure they'll win- They don't know what the hell's going on

They've pretty much given up on life
Don CorneoBuuzzzzz! Wrong!


They're sure they'll win
Don CorneoWoo-hoo! Right!


They don't know what the hell's going on
Don CorneoClose, but no cigar!

Corneo hits a switch and Cloud and the others fall through a trap door into the sewer.

Tifa,Sector 6 - Wall Market,"Right, Don Corneo.Barret told me to leave the lech alone...But something's been bothering me."
Cloud,Sector 6 - Wall Market,I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's mouth.

Aeris,Sector 6 - Wall Market,They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.

Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Let's see... If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, we should be able to get out of here."
Station man,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"I heard a rumor that the plate was going to fall, crushing this station, I've worked at so many years.But I just can't bear to leave here."
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,We made it! The pillar's standing!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Wait! You hear something...... above us?
Aeris,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,......gun fire?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Wedge!! You all right!?
Wedge,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"......Cloud...... You remembered...... my name.Barret's up top. ...help him......An' Cloud... Sorry, I wasn't any help."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,I'm going up!Aeris! You look after Wedge.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Aeris, do me a favor.I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood.There's a little girl named Marlene there......"
Aeris,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"It's dangerous here!Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly!Everyone get out of Sector 7!"
Aeris,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,(crouching next to Wedge)Don't worry. You let me handle this.
Soldier 2,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"L, look... This is my job, so I have to be here until the absolute last minute."
Redhead,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Umm... I just LOVE men with a sense of duty. Let me stay here with you.
Shopkeeper,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Uh oh...... There goes the pillar.I'm scared, but it's for your own good.If things get too hairy, we'll escape. It's not something you'll see happen too often."
Man by Fence,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Uhh...... Help! My strange and wonderful little place.
Soldier 1,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Doh! And this was supposed to be my last job! Do something!!I never thought this would ever happen to me! Great... I'm quitting tomorrow!
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Cloud!! You've gotta go now, or Barret's..."
Biggs,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Cloud... so you don't care... what happens... to the... Planet?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"- Nope, not interested- You're wounded......"
Biggs,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Hmph... you haven't changed. Oh, forget it."
Biggs,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Thanks, Cloud....don't worry 'bout me...... Barret's... fighting up there. Go help him..."
Jessie,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,...Cloud... I'm glad...... I could talk with you... one last time.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,- Don't say 'last'......- Is that so...
Jessie,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,That's... all right...Because... of our actions... many...... people died...... this probably...... is our punishment...
Jessie,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,...Is... that so......?Ha...... cool...... as usual... ex-...SOLDIER. ...always... I liked that... in you...
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Tifa! Cloud! You came!Be careful! They're attacking from the helicopter.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Better equip ourselves before they attack in full force!Here they come!
Reno,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,You're too late. Once I push this button...
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,We have to disarm it! Cloud! Barret! Please!
Reno,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,I can't have you do that. No one gets in the way of  and the Turks...
Reno,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Try and break it if you can.
Reno,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,It's time.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Cloud! I don't know how to stop this. Try it!
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,DAMN! It's a time bomb!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,...It's not a normal time bomb.
Tseng,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,That's right. You'll have a hard time disarming that one.It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Please, stop it!"
Tseng,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Ha ha ha......Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate Release System.
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Shut yer hole!
Tseng,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,I wouldn't try that...... You just might make me injure our special guest.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Aeris!!
Tseng,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Oh, you know each other?How nice you could see each other one last time. You should thank me."
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,What are you gonna do with Aeris!?
Tseng,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"I haven't decided.Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient.It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to the President."
Aeris,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"(leaning forward)Tifa, don't worry! She's all right!"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Aeris!
Aeris,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Hurry and get out!
Tseng,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Ha, ha, ha... Well, it should be starting right about now. Think you can escape in time?"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Once that Plate starts coming down it'll be too late. We gotta hurry!
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Yo, we can use this wire to get out!"
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Marlene! MARLENE!!MAR---LE---NE!!Biggs!Wedge!!Jessie!!Goddamn it!!!Dammit!DAMMIT ALL TO HELL!!!!What the hell's it all for!?ARGGHHHH!!!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Hey, Barret!"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Barret!
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,ARGGHHHH!!!
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Hey!
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Barret, stop... Please stop, Barret."
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,URGHHHH!!!
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Marlene...
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,......... Barret......?Marlene is... I think Marlene is safe.
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,......huh?
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Right before they took Aeris, she said, ""Don't worry, she's all right."" She was probably talking about Marlene."
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"R, really!?"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,But...
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Biggs...... Wedge... Jessie......
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,All three of them were in the pillar.
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Think I don't know that?But... we, all of us fought together.I don't wanna think of them as dead!"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,...and the other people in Sector 7.
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,This is all screwed up!They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed so many people...
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,...are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? Innocent people lost their lives because of us?
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"No, Tifa!That ain't it! Hell no!!It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but the Shinra!"
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to...build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold!If we don't get rid of them, they're gonna kill this planet!Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!!"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,.........I don't know.
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,What don't you know!? You don't believe me?
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,It's not that. I'm not sure about... me. My feelings.
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,An' what about you?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,.........
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Yo!Where's he think he's goin'?
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Oh! Aeris!
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?"
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,...I don't really know... But she's the one I left Marlene with.
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Damn! Marlene!!
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Tifa. There ain't no turnin' back now.
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Cloud!
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Take me to Marlene!
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,You're going to help Aeris?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Yeah... But before that, there's something I want to know."
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,What's that?
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,...it's about the Ancients.
Cloud,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Sephiroth...?
Tifa,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,Are you all right?
Barret,Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar,"Pull it together, man!"
Person Outside the Pipe,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Even with all that commotion, you went on like nothing happened. You must really been through the mill to get that."
Materia Shopkeeper,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Living in a place like this, you could live out several lives,and it still wouldn't be enough!Well, how about some materia? Make some money and then scramble out of here!"
Item Shopkeeper,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,...stare... ......hmph... we only trade items for gil here. No matter what.
Woman Walking Around,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Never thought that would come tumbling down. Maybe I better walk around looking up from now on.
Man,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,The hell's up with that!? I don't care if they're AVALANCHE or Avant-garde or whatever you call them. Anyone who brings the plates down on us is nuts!!
Kid,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,sniff......... sniff......... ......'n' I hid it...... so nuthin' like this...... would ever happen......... sniff......
Kid,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,My dream is to grow up and become a big time dealer on wall market.
Kid from the Weapons Shop,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,...sniff... sniff...First there was a rumbling...... ...then cracking... and then ker-blaMM!!......I was so scared... sniff...
Person in Blue,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"You finally think you're making a living in the pits of Midgar, and then a big piece of scrap like that falls down here... what's next?"
Man in Straw Hat,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Yeah, that's right! But, even so, where could we move to now...?"
Man,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,...sure is loud outside. Wonder what's happening?
Weapons Shopkeeper,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"You never know what's going to happen! It's a crazy world,so you'd better at least have a weapon you can depend on! Am I right or what?"
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Cloud...... wasn't it?It's about Aeris, isn't it?"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,...Sorry. The Shinra have her.
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,I know. They took her from here.
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,They were here?
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,That's what Aeris wanted...
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Why is Shinra after Aeris?
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Aeris is an Ancient. The sole survivor.
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"...What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?"
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,...Not her real mother. Oh... it must have been 15 years ago......during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far away place called Wutai.
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Returned to the planet?
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the sky,But she said it was this planet... She was a mysterious child in many ways."
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Mom.Please don't cry.
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Someone dear to you has just died.His spirit was coming to see you, but he already returned to the planet."
Tseng,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,We want you to return Aeris to us. We've been searching for her for a long time.
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,No! Never!
Tseng,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Aeris, you're a very special child. You are of special blood.Your real mother was an 'Ancient'."
Tseng,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness.Aeris will be able to bring happiness to all those in the slums.That is why the Shinra would like Aeris's cooperation......
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!
Tseng,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"But Aeris, surely you hear voices sometimes when you're all alone?"
Aeris,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"No, I don't!"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years...
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"The Shinra needed her, So I guess they wouldn't harm her."
Tifa,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,But why now......
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"She brought a little girl here with her.On the way here, Tseng found them. She probably couldn't get away fast enough.She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little girl's safety."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Must be Marlene.
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Marlene!! Aeris was caught because of Marlene!?I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm... really... sorry...
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a child alone like that!?
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"...please don't start with that. I think about it all the time. What would happen to Marlene, if I...But you gotta understand somethin'... ...I don't got an answer. I wanna be with Marlene... But I gotta fight.'Cause if I don't... the planet's gonna die.So I'm gonna keep fightin'!But, I'm worried 'bout Marlene. I really just wanna be with her... always.See? I'm goin' in circles, now."
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"...I think I understand what you're saying... She's upstairs asleep, Why don't you go and see her."
Tifa,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,It's my fault... I was the one who got Aeris involved in this.
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Don't say that. Aeris doesn't think that.
Tifa,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,I feel so depressed.
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,...sigh...
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,I'm so glad...... I'm so glad you're all right...
Marlene,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt!"
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Cloud!You gonna go help Aeris, right? She's done so much for me...If it's the Shinra you're dealin' with, I can't just sit here! I'm comin', too!"
Marlene,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Guess what? Guess what? Aeris was asking me lots of questions.Like what kind of person Cloud is. I bet she likes you, Cloud!"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,- I don't know- Let's hope so
Marlene,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Stupid!
Marlene,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,I won't tell Tifa!
Tifa,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"You're going after Aeris, right?"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Yeah.
Tifa,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,I'm coming with you.
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,We're going right into Shinra Headquarters. ...You gotta be prepared for the worst.
Tifa,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"I know.Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit.If I stayed here... I'll go crazy."
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?"
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Yes, I don't mind."
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else.
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,...You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
Tifa,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,How do we get to the Shinra Building?
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,There ain't no train that goes up there anymore...
Tifa,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"......Well, let's just go to Wall Market. We might be able to find something there."
Elmyra,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"I mean it, come back to her. Don't get yourself killed."
Marlene,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Daddy, Tifa,Cloud! Please bring Aeris back!"
Punk,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Hey!! It's you!!Sorry, but I already heard about you.In addition to dressing like a woman, it seems you like to smash and grind things.We only let cultured customers in! Got it? Then you'd better leave!"
Guy Outside Inn,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Hey, ya'll. Please stay here!"
Kid by Cat Statue,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,It came down from the sky.But the old guy who likes tanks took all of it away. I wanted some too.
Punk,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,I never believed that Sector 7 would ever come down.
Man Outside Restaurant,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"According to that guy with the tank, if you're strong enough, anyone can make it to the top plate.So, build your strength by having a plate of our food."
Man Outside Dress Shop,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,That was scary...
Clothing Shop Owner,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"You're dressed normal today. If something else interesting comes up, let me in on it."
Man Cooking Outside,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Phew, it's all dusty ever since the sky came down. I'll have to start over."
Person 1,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Is this pile of trash getting bigger?
Person 2,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Yes, I think so.A lot of things came falling down when the Sector 7 pillar fell."
Person 1,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Right, right, you're right. The owner of the Weapons Shop scavenged all the stuff that came falling down."
Person 2,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Oh is that why? He seems pretty suspicious these days.
Person 1,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Oh, you mean he went out to the Plate cross section next to the Don's Mansion, right?"
Person 2,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Oh, you know! I wonder what he's doing?"
Person 1,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Yeah! It gives me the chills.
Beautiful Bro,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,So? How's it?
Man Using Punching Bag,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,More strength.I bet you could climb all the way up to the upper plate if you used that pipe.Don't you know? The old man at the Weapon shop can tell you more about it.
Redhead,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Scary, isn't it? You just never know when the plate might come crashing down."
Redhead 2,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Yeah. I'd like to climb up to the plate if I could.
Weapons Shop Owner,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,You goin' up to the plate? You better have a Battery.
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,You're gonna sell me something you just found?
Weapons Shop Owner,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Hey, you knew? But I repaired it, so it's all right."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Why do I need a battery to climb up to the plate?
Weapons Shop Owner,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,You'll find out when you get there. How 'bout 100 Gil for each?
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"......- All right, I'll take them- I think you're full of it"
Weapons Shop Owner,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Come again.
Weapons Shop Owner,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Hmm, looks like you're a little short, son. Come back again."
Weapons Shop Owner,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"All right then, go see for yourself. You'll be back again."
Kid,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Wanna see somethin' awesome? Follow me!
Kotch,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Hey! You're... not them... you're...Please, help me!"
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,- Help him- Leave him
Kotch,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Thanks!You know what? After you left, some Shinra guys forced themselves in here saying things like 'information leaked' and 'good for nothing'.They took Don somewhere and that's it...... I'm still here.Oops! They're here again... I'm outta here! SEE ya"
Kotch,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,I... I was just following the Don's orders! Help me!
Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary...... Brrr.
Tifa,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Can we climb it?
Girl,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Yeah. It leads to the Upper World.
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Awright! We'll climb this wire!
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Just a normal wire.
Barret,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.
Tifa,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,You're right. This is the only way to save Aeris...
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Ok, that was a bad analogy, but, Barret, I understand how you feel.Let's go!"
Kid 2,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Oh man! This is horrible...
Kid,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,"Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing."
Cloud,Sector 5 - Aeris's Story,Maybe if I put a battery in...The propeller might work.
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Hey, you oughta know this building well."
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"...Not really, now that I think about it,This's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters."
Barret,The Shinra Building,"I heard about this place before.Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to even for employees.Must be where they took Aeris.The security's pretty light now. Awright, let's go!!"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through the main entrance, are you?"
Barret,The Shinra Building,Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and......
Tifa,The Shinra Building,That's not going to work! We've got to find another way...
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, Aeris'll..."
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"I know that! But if we get caught here...Hey, Cloud. ...What should we do?"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,- Let's bust on in!- Let's sneak in quietly
Barret,The Shinra Building,"That's more like it! C'mon, let's go!!"
Receptionist,The Shinra Building,"Excuse me! If you don't have an appointment, you'll just have to..."
Barret,The Shinra Building,Don't need no appointment... This is a 'mergency!Anyone who don't wanna get their face bashed in better git outta the way!!
Receptionist,The Shinra Building,Yaagghh!
Soldiers,The Shinra Building,"Who do they think they are?Y, You don't think that's AVALANCHE?Intruders! Seize them!!"
Barret,The Shinra Building,Let's go to the top!
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"Nothing. Have to find another way up, I guess..."

Shopkeeper,The Shinra Building,"Welcome. Today we have on special...Eagghhh!!Here, t, take the money..."
Barret,The Shinra Building,Don't want no money. AVALANCHE ain't no packa criminals.We jes want back what your boss stole from us.
Shopkeeper,The Shinra Building,"A, AVALANCHE?"
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Now we ain't gonna hurt you. Might even pay ya, if ya help us."
Shopkeeper,The Shinra Building,Ok... ok... well...Thank you and come again... Forget I said that...
Shopkeeper,The Shinra Building,What is it?
Shopkeeper,The Shinra Building,"You opened up all those things without asking and, hey wait!"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,......What's wrong?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,I didn't want to start a ruckus till we saved Aeris.I should have known that was impossible though...
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Heh, heh, heh."
Cloud,The Shinra Building,What is it? You're givin' me the willies.
Barret,The Shinra Building,So there are times when even you fight for other people. I am impressed.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Who cares if you're impressed...?
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Y'know, I ain't so good at sayin' this, but... Sorry... for lotsa things."
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Wh, what the!?"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Look!
Barret,The Shinra Building,"DA-MN...!I don't care where, Cloud! Just stop it!"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,What's going on!?
Shinra Employee,The Shinra Building,"Oh man!!No, uh, that's all right. My mistake. I'm, uh, not getting on.Oh man!!"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,See? Let's be careful and find a different route!
Barret,The Shinra Building,Yo! You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"Well, we've got to get to Aeris to help her somehow."
Barret,The Shinra Building,Talk about out of the way...
Tifa,The Shinra Building,I don't have time to argue with you. I'm going!
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Y, yo, Tifa! Don't go off by yourself..."
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"Wait a minute, Cloud!"
Barret,The Shinra Building,Don't know... Why... the hell... We gotta... climb...
Cloud,The Shinra Building,...Because we don't want to start a commotion until we've saved Aeris.I doubt that's possible though...
Barret,The Shinra Building,...heh heh heh.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Knock it off. You're giving me the creeps.
Barret,The Shinra Building,So even you will fight for someone else. I had you figured wrong I guess.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Who cares what you figured!
Barret,The Shinra Building,I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong...
Tifa,The Shinra Building,heh heh heh......
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"What's that supposed to mean, Tifa?"
Barret,The Shinra Building,...how much farther do these stairs go on?
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Why don't you ask them?
Barret,The Shinra Building,"It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', d'ya think?"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Of course not!!
Barret,The Shinra Building,Right... couldn't be that...Are we there yet?
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Not yet.
Barret,The Shinra Building,...there yet?
Tifa,The Shinra Building,I said not yet!
Barret,The Shinra Building,Yo...
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"Look, don't even ask! We're way way way way far away from being there yet, ok!?"
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Damn, man! I've had it! I'm going back!"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,And take just as long going down as you did coming up?
Barret,The Shinra Building,............
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"C'mon, Barret. Pull it together!"
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Yeah, well all I know is I'm just flesh 'n' blood... 'cept for this arm of mine.Don't treat me like I'm some ex-member of SOLDIER or somethin'......"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"What about me!? I'm human too! Oh, do what you want, I'm going on!"
Barret,The Shinra Building,What're ya ignorant? I didn't mean that...
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"All right, all right!Cloud, you go on ahead too!!"
Barret,The Shinra Building,Yo... What floor is this?
Tifa,The Shinra Building,...I gave up counting.
Barret,The Shinra Building,Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?That Shinra... They're just no damn good.
Tifa,The Shinra Building,.........
Barret,The Shinra Building,"huff... Man, I'm beat...Marlene, Daddy wanted to see your face one more time..."
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Would you stop acting like a retard and climb!?It's just a bit more!...maybe.
Barret,The Shinra Building,F...finally... M... made it...N... never wanna see... no more stairs the rest of my life...
Tifa,The Shinra Building,huff... puff... this really takes it out of you...But this is it. We'd better get ready...!
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Hey Cloud!You come all this way, you thinkin' of goin' back down to the 1st floor?"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,- Yeah- No......
Barret,The Shinra Building,"We ain't got no time for that! Stop messin' around, boy!"
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Yeah, that's right! Let's go on then!"
Soldiers,The Shinra Building,Destroy the intruders!
Cloud,The Shinra Building,What's this?
Tifa,The Shinra Building,I hope Aeris is all right.
Barret,The Shinra Building,This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down.
Guard,The Shinra Building,What're you doing here!? No unauthorized people are allowed here!!
Guard 2,The Shinra Building,"People like you don't belong here! Go on, get out!"
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Lookit that, all them guards is runnin' around.Cloud, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to come.When those guards turn around, MOVE!"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Stay in the shadows!
Guard,The Shinra Building,Hey there! What do you think you're doing there!?
Barret,The Shinra Building,What the hell're ya doin'? Come on gotta do it again!
Barret,The Shinra Building,I shoulda known it'd turn out like this...If I'd known it'd be like this in the first place...
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Shhh! Now let's move on.
Barret,The Shinra Building,Ok! We gonna rock!
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"Remember, we're here to save Aeris."
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Hell, I know that!"
Woman,The Shinra Building,"I don't remember seeing your face before... You new here?Say, you're cute. Let me teach you some... things."
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"- Things?- Um, I'm kinda in a hurry..."
Woman,The Shinra Building,Wipe that stupid look off your face. I was only going to teach you how to get to the next floor.The higher ups in the company use the floors above the 60th floor. But you can't get there without a keycard.Get a keycard and you can use the elevators freely.
Woman,The Shinra Building,Oh? That's too bad...
Man,The Shinra Building,This is the lounge floor. Above us are the special floors for the big wigs in the company.It's tough working under someone. Tires you out.
Man 2,The Shinra Building,What's keeping her? Did she forget her keycard?Even employees can't walk around above the 60th floor without a keycard.
Man 3,The Shinra Building,The hell are you? What're you doin' around here?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,- Where's Aeris?- ......
Man 3,The Shinra Building,"Aeris? How did you know that name? You must be...!?Aeris, you mean that kid. The receptionist. Yeah, I was startin' to worry 'bout her myself.And so another rival appears on the scene, eh?You mean, she's not? It's someone else?"
Man 3,The Shinra Building,"Oh, I see. So you must be that whatcha call it...Shinra, Inc. Repair Division!!You know, it looks like this building is starting to fall apart.This door was just pushed open. You ought to fix this right away.Oh yeah, and take a look on the other floors too. I'll give you this."
Man 3,The Shinra Building,This door is stuck wide open. Better fix this right away.
Woman Sitting Down,The Shinra Building,I thought I heard a ruckus downstairs a minute ago. Do you know what that was all about?
Man Sitting Down,The Shinra Building,No idea. But no need to worry because everything above the 60th floor is safe.
Hart,The Shinra Building,How do you do?This is the Midgar Mayor's Office. Mayor Domino is in his office.I am the Deputy Mayor. If you should have any questions feel free to ask me...
Domino,The Shinra Building,"Hmm? Oh, and who might you be?You all must be those... ahem... Me? I'm , the Mayor of Midgar.Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it is really run by Shinra, Inc.My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents...Me! The Mayor! A librarian! Ohh......You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the password, I'll give you my keycard.Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my keycard!Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item!"
Hart,The Shinra Building,"Did you speak with the Mayor?What? A password? Oh, I get it...He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really blame him, Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra.Maybe I can help you.What do you want to know?"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,- HELP- Forget it
Hart,The Shinra Building,"Sure, sure. All right.As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people.So here's a hint......for 500 gil."
Cloud,The Shinra Building,- Give him the money- Forget it!
Hart,The Shinra Building,"Oh, my... well, Thank you very much.Now listen. On this floor are four research libraries for four different sections of Shinra, Inc. ...Parts of the password are hidden in each of the libraries.Pay careful attention to the files in each room.The name of each library is written on the plaque outside the door.What can I do for you?"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"- Give me the hint again- Give me the next hint- Uh, nothing"
Hart,The Shinra Building,"Sure, sure. All right.As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people. So here's a hint......for 1000 gil."
Cloud,The Shinra Building,- Give him the money- Forget it!
Hart,The Shinra Building,"Oh, my... well, Thank you very much.Now, in each library will be one file mixed in from another library.Look carefully at the numbers on each file.What can I do for you?"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"- Give me the hint again- Give me the next hint- Uh, nothing"
Hart,The Shinra Building,"Sure, sure. All right.As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people.So here's a hint......for 2000 gil."
Cloud,The Shinra Building,- Give him the money- Forget it!
Hart,The Shinra Building,"Oh, my... well, Thank you very much.There is a number at the beginning of each file name.Of course there's a number even on the files that don't belong in that library.Match the number with the letters in the title of the file.If the file starts with a 4, then check the fourth letter and... well, you get the idea."
Hart,The Shinra Building,Hey now! You're a bit short.I'm sure even item stores in the slums don't give credit nowadays.
Hart,The Shinra Building,"...I see. Then, I guess that's that.Good luck finding it on your own.If you still can't find it. I'll just be right over here. Ready to tell you anytime..."
Domino,The Shinra Building,"Got it?Then tell me.So, what's the password?"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,- BEST- KING- ORBS- BOMB- MAKO- HOJO- Wait a second
Domino,The Shinra Building,"BEST!!God, I love the sound of that! BEST!! I AM the best... ME!! No matter what anyone else says, you'd better believe it.KING!!God, I love the sound of that! KING!! President Shinra sucks! I should be King of Midgar!BOMB!!God, I love the sound of that! BOMB!! I'm so angry, I'm like a walking time bomb waiting to explode!MAKO!!God, I love the sound of that! MAKO! If I had a lot more of it, I would be a real Mayor!"
Domino,The Shinra Building,"......hmm. Well, ok. Here, take it."
Domino,The Shinra Building,"I never thought you'd get it on the first try...Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Oh well, a promise is a promise. Take this, too."
Domino,The Shinra Building,Nope! You're ALL wrong! It's a much better word than that! Try again!
Domino,The Shinra Building,"......hmm. Well, ok. Here, take it.Hmm. It appears you're not completely stupid.Fine then, take this."
Domino,The Shinra Building,"Why would I do something like this, you ask?To mess with them, of course! Shinra's been torturing me forever.That's why I was a little rough on you all just now. Now go up there and really make them suffer.This ought to make us even! Heh heh heh......But my card will only get you to the 65th floor.Can you believe how they treat me? ...ME! Like some common employee..."
Hart,The Shinra Building,If you run into President Shinra please don't tell him about this.I can't be a partner to anymore trouble for Shinra.

Woman on Treadmill,The Shinra Building,"...huff... puff... If you're tired, you should get some rest in the next room."
Man on Treadmill,The Shinra Building,...huff... weeze... I'm starting to worry about my belly......
Cloud,The Shinra Building,.......- Should I try it?- This is so stupid
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Whew...- Better quit pretty soon- Continue a bit longer

Cloud,The Shinra Building,What is this...... a Megaphone?Hanging on to this won't do any good...
Cloud,The Shinra Building,A model of Midgar... born from Mako sucked right out of the earth.Parts of the model are missing...- Place the Midgar parts- Leave it alone
Cloud,The Shinra Building,...Sounds like something opened up...
Secretary,The Shinra Building,"Whew, I'm so sick of carrying all these files...But I get to meet lots of guys. I guess that's the benefit of being a secretary!"
Secretary,The Shinra Building,"Hello...!! (He's kinda cute. But looks like that girl's with him... But that's kinda exciting!)Hello...!! (Just concentrate on work...)Hello...!! (Looks so serious. I guess it means the man's fastidious.)Hello...!! (Wow, Pee-U! No thanks.)"
Man,The Shinra Building,Is it just me or does the Conference Room smell? There's some sort of stench coming from somewhere...
Man 2,The Shinra Building,................................................................................................................................................Phew!
Man 3,The Shinra Building,"Hey, when you're in the bathroom, do you ever hear whispers coming from somewhere?"
Man 4,The Shinra Building,They're having another executive meeting. I wonder if it's about that Plate incident.
Man 5,The Shinra Building,"It gives me the feeling that I AM alive. The feeling of moving this world, just with my hands."
Woman,The Shinra Building,"Come on, we're building the future of Mako!"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,- Flush?- Climb up?- Get out of here
Barret,The Shinra Building,Geez--! That's a lotta suits!
Reeve,The Shinra Building,"We have the damage estimates for Sector 7.Considering those factories we already set up and all the investments, the damage is estimated at approximately 10 Billion gil...The estimated cost to rebuild Sector 7 is..."
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,We're not rebuilding.
Reeve,The Shinra Building,What?
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,We're leaving Sector 7 as it is.And restarting the Neo-Midgar plan.
Reeve,The Shinra Building,...then the Ancients?
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,The Promised Land will soon be ours.I want you to raise the Mako rates 15% in every area.
Palmer,The Shinra Building,"Rate hike! Rate hike! Tra, la, la! And please include our Space Program in the budget!"
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,Reeve and Scarlet will divide the extra income from the rate increase.
Palmer,The Shinra Building,Oh man!
Reeve,The Shinra Building,"Sir. If you raise the rates, the people will lose confidence..."
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,"It'll be all right.The ignorant citizens won't lose confidence, they'll trust Shinra, Inc. even more."
Heidegger,The Shinra Building,"Ha ha ha!After all, we're the ones who saved Sector 7 from AVALANCHE!"
Barret,The Shinra Building,That dirty #$*$^
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,Hojo. How's the girl?
Hojo,The Shinra Building,"As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference is 18%."
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,How long will the research take?
Hojo,The Shinra Building,"Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter.That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create one that could withstand our research for a long time."
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,What about the Promised Land? Won't it hinder our plans?
Hojo,The Shinra Building,That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong... and yet has her weaknesses.
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,That concludes our meeting.
Scarlet,The Shinra Building,Something stinks...
Cloud,The Shinra Building,They were talking about Aeris... right?
Barret,The Shinra Building,I dunno.
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Probably.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Let's follow 'em.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Hojo... huh...?
Man 4,The Shinra Building,"(after the meeting)Sittin' here facing the monitor... day in, day out... I kinda feel...... forced... into doing it. And I just don't have any motivation."
Barret,The Shinra Building,"I remember him.That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science Department. Cloud, don't you know him?"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,This is the first time I've actually ever seen him. So... that's what he looks like...
Man,The Shinra Building,Let's see... The specimen Hojo asked me for is...
Man,The Shinra Building,Is this today's specimen?
Hojo,The Shinra Building,Yes. We're starting right away. Raise it to the upper level.
Hojo,The Shinra Building,My precious specimen...
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Precious specimen...?Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Jenova...
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Jenova... Sephiroth's... So... they've brought it here.
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"Cloud, be strong!"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Did you see it?
Barret,The Shinra Building,See what?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,It's moving...... still alive?
Barret,The Shinra Building,Where's its $#&*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep goin'.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Aeris!
Hojo,The Shinra Building,"Aeris? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,We're taking Aeris back.
Hojo,The Shinra Building,Outsiders......
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Shoulda noticed it earlier, you..."
Hojo,The Shinra Building,There's so many frivolous things in this world.
Hojo,The Shinra Building,"Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should.The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could operate it? Hmm?"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Ugh.
Hojo,The Shinra Building,"That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before you make any rash moves.Now, bring in the Specimen!"
Aeris,The Shinra Building,"Cloud, help!"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,What do you think you're doin'?
Hojo,The Shinra Building,"Lending a helping hand to an endangered species... Both of them are on the brink of extinction...If I don't help, all these animals will disappear."
Tifa,The Shinra Building,...animal? That's terrible! Aeris is a human being!
Barret,The Shinra Building,You're gonna pay!
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Barret! Can't you do anything?
Barret,The Shinra Building,Awright!! Step back!
Hojo,The Shinra Building,Stop!!
Hojo,The Shinra Building,Wh... what are you do-- Oh! My precious specimens...
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Now's our chance to get Aeris!
Aeris,The Shinra Building,"Thanks, Cloud."
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Cloud... what's wrong?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,...The elevator is moving.
Hojo,The Shinra Building,This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen!
Red,The Shinra Building,He's rather strong. I'll help you all out.
Tifa,The Shinra Building,It talked!?
Red,The Shinra Building,"I'll talk as much as you want later, Miss."
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"We'll take care of that monster.Somebody take Aeris somewhere safe...- Tifa, I'm countin' on you!- Barret, take care of her!"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,What's your name?
Red,The Shinra Building,"Hojo has named me,  XIII. A name with no meaning whatsoever to me. Call me whatever you wish."
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Come on!
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"Aeris, you all right?"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"She seems all right, ...in many ways."
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,"I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things."
Barret,The Shinra Building,What are you?
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,"An informed question. But difficult to answer. I am what you see....You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of here. I'll lead the way."
Aeris,The Shinra Building,Cloud... so you did come for me.
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to throw Hojo off guard......
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Now we've saved Aeris, ain't no need to be in this buildin'! So let's get the hell outta here!"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"If all five of us go together, we'll be noticed. Let's break up into two groups."
Barret,The Shinra Building,Later! Meet up at the 66th Floor Elevator!
Aeris,The Shinra Building,I'll see you later!! We'll be waiting at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Tifa,The Shinra Building,We'll be going first! Meet at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,Don't be late. Do you know where the Elevator is? The 66th Floor!
Man,The Shinra Building,"No! Please don't kill me. I only did what Hojo told me to do.To prove it to you... here, this is the key card to the 68th Floor. Would I be doing this if I was the enemy?Received Key Item ""Keycard 68""!
The man then flees.
If Cloud attempts to go anywhere but the elevator...

BarretWhere you goin'? Everyone's waitin' at the 66th Floor Elevator.
AerisNot that way! Everyone's on the 66th Floor Elevator.
TifaWhere are you going? Everyone's waiting for us at the 66th Floor Elevator.

Cloud and the others get on the 66th floor elevator. Rude of the Turks enters behind them.
CloudH, hey! What is it?
RudeWould you press 'Up' please?
CloudTurks? Must be a trap...
Rude steps aside and Tseng enters.
TsengIt must have been a real thrill for you... Did you enjoy it?
CloudGgh...
The Turks take them up to the 70th floor, where they find the others also taken captive. Aeris is missing, though.
CloudYou all got caught, too?Where is Aeris!?
President ShinraIn a safe place.She's the last surviving Ancient...Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history.
Red XIIICetra... That girl, is she a survivor of the Cetra?
President ShinraCetra, or the Ancients will show us the way to the 'Promised Land.' I'm expecting a lot out of her.
Red XIIIThe Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?
President ShinraEven so, it's just too appealing to not to pursue.It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile....If the land is fertile...
BarretThen there's gotta be Mako!
President ShinraExactly. That is why our money sucking Mako Reactor is necessary.The abundant Mako will just come out on its own.That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory...
Barret@$#*^%! Quit dreamin'!
President ShinraOh really, don't you know? These days all it takes for your dreams to come true is money and power.Well, that is all for our meeting.
RudeCome on! Outta his way!
Cloud, Tifa, and Red XIII turn away without protest, but Barret hangs back.
BarretHold it! I got a lot I wanna say to you!
He starts towards President Shinra, but Rude drags him away.
President ShinraIf you need something else... talk to my secretary.
The scene changes to the detainment area, where they've been placed in cells. Cloud with Tifa, Barret with Red XIII, and Aeris by herself.
TifaPsst (Can we get out?)
Cloud- (Leave it to me)- (Kinda hard)

(Leave it to me)
TifaPsst (Cloud, you're so brave!)


(Kinda hard)
TifaPsst (Don't give up!)

CloudI wonder how Barret is doing
BarretHey!Aeris is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is Cetra.The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is searching for that Promised Land.I only heard stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it really exists.Is that right?The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako energy.Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the Mako energy....and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker.I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin' new members!!Me, Tifa, Cloud... and Aeris too.
He turns to Red XIII.
How 'bout you?
Red XIII turns away and lies down.
BarretYou're so damn boring.
CloudI wonder how Red XIII is doing
Red XIII............Grandpa.
BarretGrandpa!? Ha, ha, ha...... Grandpa, hmm...... ha, ha, ha......
Red XIIIWhat's so funny?
BarretNothin'...... ha, ha
CloudI wonder how Aeris is doing
AerisCloud, are you there?
CloudAeris!? You safe?
AerisYeah, I'm all right.I knew that Cloud would come for me.
CloudHey, I'm your bodyguard, right?
AerisThe deal was for one date, right?
Tifa sits up from where she's been lying on the cot.
Tifa............oh, I get it.
Aeris...!? Tifa! Tifa, you're there too!
TifaEXCUSE me.You know, Aeris. I have a question.
AerisWhat?
TifaDoes the Promised Land really exist?
Aeris...I don't know.All I know is...The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and unlock the Planet.And...... then...The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises supreme happiness.
Tifa...What does that mean?
AerisMore than words...... I don't know.
Cloud...Speak with the Planet?
TifaJust what does the Planet say?
AerisIt's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what they are saying.
CloudYou hear it now?
AerisI, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said that Midgar was no longer safe. That is... my real mother.Someday I'll get out of Midgar... Speak with the Planet and find my Promised Land....That's what mom said.I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but...
CloudLet's just get some sleep
They settle down to rest. Cloud wakes before the others, finding the door to his and Tifa's cell open.
Tifa......
CloudThe door's open... When did it open?
He runs out into the hall to find the guard dead.
What's happened?
He runs back into the cell.
Tifa... Wake up!
She sits up immediately.
TifaWhat's wrong?
CloudSomething's wrong. Look outside.
Tifa runs out, and Cloud joins her.
TifaI wonder what happened...
CloudHe should have the key on him...Come on, Tifa, get Aeris. I'll go help Barret and the others.
Cloud runs into Barret and Red XIII's cell.
Barret, Red XIII... come with me. Something's wrong.
BarretHow'd you get in? Why's the door open!?
Barret and Red XIII run out.
TifaThis's kinda eerie...
AerisMust've been attacked by...
BarretThe hell's goin' on'!?
Red XIIINo human could've done this.I'll go on ahead.
BarretI'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get caught by Shinra!
TifaCome on, let's follow Red XIII!
Cloud, Aeris, and Tifa follow Red XIII to where the Jenova specimen was kept, finding a huge bloody hole in the front of the empty chamber, with a trail of blood across the floor.
Cloud...Did it get away? Jenova...?
Red XIIIJenova Specimen... Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens.
Red XIII heads for the elevator and the others follow.
Red XIIIIt looks like it leads up...
They follow the trail of blood to the 70th floor, where they find President Shinra dead at his desk, impaled by the Masamune blade.
BarretHe's dead... The leader of Shinra, Inc. is dead...
Tifa runs around behind the desk.
TifaThen this sword must be...!?
CloudSephiroth's!!
Tifa...Sephiroth is alive?
Cloud...Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword.
BarretWho cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra now!
PalmerUh!
He comes out from behind a pillar and tries to run, but Cloud and Barret catch him.
P, p, p, please, don't kill me!
CloudWhat happened?
PalmerSe... Sephiroth. Sephiroth came.
CloudDid you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?
PalmerYeah, I saw him! I saw him with my own eyes!
CloudYou really saw him?
PalmerUh! Would I lie to you at a time like this!? And I heard his voice too!Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the Promised Land.
TifaThen what?Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?
BarretSo he's a good guy then?
CloudSave the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!!It's not that simple! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is different!
Palmer frees himself and runs off as a helicopter arrives outside.
BarretRufus! &*%$! I forgot about him!
TifaWho's that?
BarretVice President Rufus. The President's son.I heard that he's been assigned somewhere else for a long time...
AerisI've heard that no one's ever seen him bleed or cry.
Red XIIII only know his name.
TifaI wonder what kinda person he is...
They run outside to where Rufus and Palmer are, Palmer apparently just finishing up a quick report.
RufusSo... So Sephiroth was actually here. ...By the way.
Palmer runs off.
RufusWho are you guys?
CloudI'm Cloud, former SOLDIER First Class!
BarretI'm from AVALANCHE!
TifaSame here!
Aeris...a flower girl from the slums.
Red XIII (growling)...a research specimen.
RufusWhat a crew.Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc.
BarretYou only President, 'cause yer old man died!
RufusThat's right. I'll let you hear my new appointment speech....Old man tried to control the world with money. It seems to have been working.The population thought that Shinra would protect them.Work at Shinra, get your pay. If a terrorist attacks, the Shinra army will help you.It looks perfect on the outside.But, I do things differently.I'll control the world with fear. It takes too much to do it like my old man.A little fear will control the minds of the common people. There's no reason to waste money on them.
TifaHe likes to make speeches just like his father.
Cloud turns to Barret.
CloudGet outta this building with Aeris!
BarretWhat?
CloudI'll explain later! Barret! This is the real crisis for the Planet!
BarretThe hell's that supposed to mean?
CloudI'll tell you later! Just take my word for it now! I'll go after I take care of him!
BarretAwright, Cloud!
Barret and the others run back downstairs. Aeris hangs back.
AerisCloud... I just thought of something.
Tifa...I'll wait for Cloud! Everyone, get to the elevator!
Aeris nods, and she, Red XIII, and Barret run on.
AerisHmm, it's going to get pretty ugly from here on. We should check on our equipment.
They get on the elevator, and a combat robot attacks them from the other car. They defeat the robot and continue down.
Back to Cloud, as he and Rufus face off...
RufusWhy do you want to fight me?
CloudYou seek the Promised Land and Sephiroth.
RufusHm, exactly.Mm? Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?
Cloud...A lot has happened. Anyway, I can't let either you or Sephiroth have the Promised Land!
RufusI see. I guess this means we won't become friends.
Cloud fights Rufus and his pet Dark Nation.
RufusHeh, heh, heh...
Ultimately, Rufus decides to beat a dignified retreat.
RufusHeh... That's all for today...
Rufus grabs hold of the helicopter and it flies off with him. Cloud runs downstairs to where Tifa is waiting.
TifaWhere's Rufus?
CloudI couldn't finish 'em. Looks like this's gonna get complicated.
Back to Aeris and the others as they arrive on the first floor. If you attempt to get back on any of the elevators (depending on the floor):
AerisQuickly! We'll escape out this way......Quickly, we can escape this way...Quickly, we have to get out of here...
They head for the front entrance.
BarretI'll go on ahead!
He runs out, firing his gun-arm, but soon comes back in.
*&^%(*... surrounded, huh?If I was alone this wouldn't be a thang but, I gotta reputation to protect.
AerisYou all get out while you can.It's not you they're after... it's me.
BarretYeah, well that ain't happenin'.You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to watch out for you!Ok, playtime's over for you jackasses...
Aeris...thank you, Mr. Barret!
BarretWho you callin' Mr. Barret? That don't sound right!
Red XIIIWell then...If you are through talking, may I suggest that we think of a way to get out of here.
BarretHuh? Oh, oh yeah... You a cold man. Just like someone else 'round here I know.
Red XIIIDid you say something?
BarretNotta thing. So what're we gonna do?
TifaBarret!!
Tifa comes running down from upstairs.
BarretTifa! Where's Cloud?
TifaEveryone, over here!
BarretHuh? What's up? Where's Cloud?
TifaI'll tell you later! Hurry, Hurry!!
They all climb into the display truck and drive it out the window, following Cloud on the motorcycle. Shinra troops follow on motorcycles, but Cloud dispatches them with his sword. They reach the end of the road, and a large, armored tank/robot attacks from behind. They defeat the robot, and find themselves standing at the edge of Midgar.
BarretWell, what do we do now?
CloudSephiroth is alive. I... I have to settle the score.
BarretAnd that'll save the Planet?
Cloud...Seems like it.
BarretAwright, I'm going!
AerisI'll go too. ...I have things that I want to find out.
CloudAbout the Ancients?
Aeris......y things.
TifaI guess this's good bye, Midgar.
They climb down a cable to the ground level.
Red XIIII'm going back to my hometown. I'll go with you as far as that.
Tifa...I guess this is the start of our journey...
Cloud- You hate traveling?- It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?

You hate traveling?
Tifa...I don't know. But, I don't have anywhere else to go. So I guess it doesn't really matter whether I like to travel or not.


It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?
Tifa......Mmm. But you know, it should be all right if you keep your promise.

AerisYou know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar...
Cloud- Really? ...You worried?- It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?

Really? ...You worried?
AerisA little, ...no, maybe a lot. But I have my bodyguard, right?


It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?
AerisI thought you'd say that!

BarretWe told Aeris's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be safe too.
Cloud- Yeah, she should be- Hmm, I don't know

Yeah, she should be
AerisShe said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. ...Maybe it's for the best.


Hmm, I don't know
AerisStop it, Cloud! I'm worried too.

CloudThen...- Let's stay here for a while- Let's go!
BarretWe need a group leader for our journey. 'Course only me could be the leader.
TifaYou think so...?
AerisIt would have to be Cloud.
Barret^#$^%...... awright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If something happens, we'll meet up there.'Sides, we can't have 5 people strolling down the fields. It's too dangerous. Split us into 2 parties...

If Cloud chooses Aeris + Tifa for his party...
Barret...Thought you'd do that.Later, at Kalm!


If Cloud chooses Barret + Red XIII for his party...
Aeris...Unexpected
Tifa...combination.Well, have fun with just the guys.We'll see you at Kalm!

They otherwise depart without comment.

< Sector 5 | The Shinra Building | Kalm >"
Barret,The Shinra Building,Where you goin'? Everyone's waitin' at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Aeris,The Shinra Building,Not that way! Everyone's on the 66th Floor Elevator.
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Where are you going? Everyone's waiting for us at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"H, hey! What is it?"
Rude,The Shinra Building,Would you press 'Up' please?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Turks? Must be a trap...
Tseng,The Shinra Building,It must have been a real thrill for you... Did you enjoy it?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Ggh...
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"You all got caught, too?Where is Aeris!?"
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,"In a safe place.She's the last surviving Ancient...Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history."
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,"Cetra... That girl, is she a survivor of the Cetra?"
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,"Cetra, or the Ancients will show us the way to the 'Promised Land.' I'm expecting a lot out of her."
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,"Even so, it's just too appealing to not to pursue.It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile....If the land is fertile..."
Barret,The Shinra Building,Then there's gotta be Mako!
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,Exactly. That is why our money sucking Mako Reactor is necessary.The abundant Mako will just come out on its own.That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory...
Barret,The Shinra Building,@$#*^%! Quit dreamin'!
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,"Oh really, don't you know? These days all it takes for your dreams to come true is money and power.Well, that is all for our meeting."
Rude,The Shinra Building,Come on! Outta his way!
Barret,The Shinra Building,Hold it! I got a lot I wanna say to you!
President Shinra,The Shinra Building,If you need something else... talk to my secretary.
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Psst (Can we get out?)
Cloud,The Shinra Building,- (Leave it to me)- (Kinda hard)
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"Psst (Cloud, you're so brave!)"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Psst (Don't give up!)
Cloud,The Shinra Building,I wonder how Barret is doing
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Hey!Aeris is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is Cetra.The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is searching for that Promised Land.I only heard stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it really exists.Is that right?The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako energy.Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the Mako energy....and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker.I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin' new members!!Me, Tifa, Cloud... and Aeris too."
Barret,The Shinra Building,You're so damn boring.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,I wonder how Red XIII is doing
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,............Grandpa.
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Grandpa!? Ha, ha, ha...... Grandpa, hmm...... ha, ha, ha......"
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,What's so funny?
Barret,The Shinra Building,"Nothin'...... ha, ha"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,I wonder how Aeris is doing
Aeris,The Shinra Building,"Cloud, are you there?"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Aeris!? You safe?
Aeris,The Shinra Building,"Yeah, I'm all right.I knew that Cloud would come for me."
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"Hey, I'm your bodyguard, right?"
Aeris,The Shinra Building,"The deal was for one date, right?"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"............oh, I get it."
Aeris,The Shinra Building,"...!? Tifa! Tifa, you're there too!"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"EXCUSE me.You know, Aeris. I have a question."
Aeris,The Shinra Building,What?
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Does the Promised Land really exist?
Aeris,The Shinra Building,"...I don't know.All I know is...The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and unlock the Planet.And...... then...The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises supreme happiness."
Tifa,The Shinra Building,...What does that mean?
Aeris,The Shinra Building,More than words...... I don't know.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,...Speak with the Planet?
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Just what does the Planet say?
Aeris,The Shinra Building,It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what they are saying.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,You hear it now?
Aeris,The Shinra Building,"I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said that Midgar was no longer safe. That is... my real mother.Someday I'll get out of Midgar... Speak with the Planet and find my Promised Land....That's what mom said.I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but..."
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Let's just get some sleep
Tifa,The Shinra Building,......
Cloud,The Shinra Building,The door's open... When did it open?
Tifa,The Shinra Building,What's wrong?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Something's wrong. Look outside.
Tifa,The Shinra Building,I wonder what happened...
Cloud,The Shinra Building,"He should have the key on him...Come on, Tifa, get Aeris. I'll go help Barret and the others."
Barret,The Shinra Building,How'd you get in? Why's the door open!?
Tifa,The Shinra Building,This's kinda eerie...
Aeris,The Shinra Building,Must've been attacked by...
Barret,The Shinra Building,The hell's goin' on'!?
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,No human could've done this.I'll go on ahead.
Barret,The Shinra Building,"I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get caught by Shinra!"
Tifa,The Shinra Building,"Come on, let's follow Red XIII!"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,...Did it get away? Jenova...?
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,Jenova Specimen... Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens.
Red XIII,The Shinra Building,It looks like it leads up...
Barret,The Shinra Building,"He's dead... The leader of Shinra, Inc. is dead..."
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Then this sword must be...!?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Sephiroth's!!
Tifa,The Shinra Building,...Sephiroth is alive?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,...Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword.
Barret,The Shinra Building,Who cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra now!
Palmer,The Shinra Building,Uh!
Cloud,The Shinra Building,What happened?
Palmer,The Shinra Building,Se... Sephiroth. Sephiroth came.
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?
Palmer,The Shinra Building,"Yeah, I saw him! I saw him with my own eyes!"
Cloud,The Shinra Building,You really saw him?
Palmer,The Shinra Building,"Uh! Would I lie to you at a time like this!? And I heard his voice too!Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the Promised Land."
Tifa,The Shinra Building,Then what?Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?
Barret,The Shinra Building,So he's a good guy then?
Cloud,The Shinra Building,Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!!It's not that simple! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is different!
Barret,The Shinra Building,Rufus! &*%$! I forgot about him!

Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"...I got the feeling I'm forgetting something...Hey, would you stay there just a minute?
Not far inside the mine, the others stop.

BarretHey . If we keep going, we'll never get to Kalm.
TifaHey, . Wasn't Kalm right before this cavern?
Red XIII...We won't get to Kalm even if we go through these caverns.


BarretYo, wassup? Can't SOLDIER-man even lead the way?
Aeris! Are you lost!?
TifaKalm should be closer to Midgar.
Red XIIIIf we're planning to meet at Kalm, we should go back and look for it again.

 and his party arrive in Kalm.

BarretThis is Kalm.
AerisWe've reached Kalm.
TifaSo this is Kalm?
Red XIII......looks like we've reached Kalm.


BarretYo, I'll be waitin' at the inn... Hurry up and get your butt over there!
AerisI wonder if everyone's there already. Let's hurry over to the inn!
TifaEveryone's waiting at the inn. Let's go .
Red XIIIWe're supposed to meet at the inn. ......Shall we go?

The party starts to enter the inn.

BarretGet over here!
AerisWell then, I'll go on ahead.
TifaLet's go .
Red XIIILet's go .

The others all go inside, but  has the opportunity to explore the town before joining them. A number of people are out in the square.
RedheadAw, c'mon! listen to me! Got anything interesting to say?......
Old ManThanks to Shinra, Inc. developing Mako energy for us, everything's more convenient now.Maybe a little too convenient.
Black-haired ManTourists, huh?There are some things you should know that'll come in handy when you travel around the world......Want me to tell you what they are?
- Tell me- I already know

Tell me
Black-haired ManThen let me explain how to use the world map.Well then, what do you want to know?
- Changing the camera angle- Map indicators- Operating the buttons

Changing the camera angle
Black-haired ManFirst of all, press the [L2 button] on the controller to change the camera angle.There are 2 angles to choose from, select the one you like.You can then rotate the angles either way by pressing the [L1 button] and [R1 button].Try different angles until you find the one you like best. It makes the journey a lot more fun!Anything else you'd like to know?


Map indicators
Black-haired ManPress the [Start button] once to view the World Map.There is a large and small map. Learn when to use which, and you won't get lost as much.Push the [Start button] twice to change the size of the map, and once more to turn it off.Pretty easy, huh?Anything else you want to ask?


Operating the buttons
Black-haired ManYou can ride things by pressing the [SELECT button] and get off by pressing the [cancel button]. This isn't so hard, either!Oh, yes, yes. You can't dash with the World Map on, so make sure not to press the [cancel button] unless you get off.Remember this because Chocobos will run away as soon as you get off them, so be careful.Anything else you want to ask?

Black-haired ManOnce on the World Map you can access the menu to save your game anywhere. It's a good idea to save frequently!Well then, bon voyage!


I already know
Black-haired ManIs that so? Well, that's that. Have a nice trip.

Man in BlueI hear that the natural resources near the reactors are being sucked dry.We're better off with them bringing in the Mako energy.
Or, if you talk to him when he stops to read the gauge outside the Weapons Shop:
What does it do? It checks the pressure of the Mako energy sent from Midgar.
ManI heard President Shinra was killed. And his son Rufus, the new president, was badly hurt.Hey, I bet that's news to you?
- Hey you're pretty clued!!- Don't care...

Hey you're pretty clued!!
ManHeh, heh, heh...... This is just between us. I heard it was that there Ava-whaddya call-ums that attacked the President Shinra and his son.


Don't care...
ManDon't care? If you're going to travel, you'd best keep an eye on what Shinra's doing.

ManShinra is leading the world around by the nose, and you guys are just gonna sit back and take it?
WomanThe famous floating city, Midgar... Just once I'd love to see it in person.South of this town past the Mythril Mine and far to the west is a Shinra harbor called Junon.They say there's a reactor and many tall buildings there. I hope to see it someday.
Inside the first house...
WomanThanks to Mako energy, life's pretty darn convenient. Thanks to Shinra.Don't you think?
- Yeah, maybe- You're full of it

Yeah, maybe
WomanSee!? How would we get by without Mako energy?


You're full of it
WomanHmmn. But I'd hate to think of what life'd be like without Mako energy.

WomanYeah, Mako energy's made our lives much easier. And it's all thanks to Shinra, Inc.
Girl UpstairsMako energy's made things a lot more convenient......But seems like a lot of plants and animals have been disappearing at a rapid pace.I think the old life was better.Don't you think so?
- Yeah, maybe- No way

Yeah, maybe
Girl UpstairsYeah, sure I'm right! You think so, don't you?


No way
Girl UpstairsThat sounds just like what my mom says.

Girl UpstairsI thought things were better when I was able to play with animals......
Inside the second house...
Old ManDid you say you came from Midgar?I used to live there, too. But I hear they got lots of troubles lately.
Inside the third house...
WomanThere was a suspicious-looking man in a black cloak! He was carrying a wicked-looking sword.Why doesn't anyone believe me? I'm all alone...
Upstairs, a boy is running around while a little girl watches him.
Girl......My older brother's so stupid. He's so embarrassing I could just puke!
BoyWhen I grow up I'm gonna be in SOLDIER. That's why I'm training hard now!!Hyah, hayah, eagghh!
Inside the fourth house...
WomanIs it true that Shinra made a Monster?
- It's true- Just a rumor
Woman (she says the same thing regardless)Yeah, well either way, as long as we're using the reactor, we can't stand up to Shinra.
Kalm TravelerThe world's at peace... all's well.I got my health, and enough to eat... all's well.
Kid outside BarMy old man was a miner, but he couldn't go to work after monsters started appearing in the Mythril Mine.Now all he does is sit around getting drunk in the bar...
Inside the bar...
Person in BlueI heard terrorists bombed a Midgar reactor...There sure have been a lot of dangerous accidents recently. I hate it, just hate it.
ManMe? I used to work in a coal mine down south called Mythril MineBut, right around then, monsters started appearing.After that, business went to pot and now I spend the days here drinking.Urrrp! ...hic... I'm stinking drunk!!
BartenderIt seems there was this group called AVALANCHE runnin' around, but I guess they finally got wiped out by SOLDIER.Shinra is trying to eliminate anyone, who stands up to them.It don't matter if we like it or not. Shinra's taken over, and we gotta live with it!
CookStay out of the kitchen.
Item ShopkeeperThis is the Item Store.
Materia ShopkeeperThis is the Materia Store.
Weapons ShopkeeperThis is the Weapons Store.
If  tries to leave Kalm...
Barret and the others are waiting for us at the inn.
His exploration of the town exhausted,  goes to the inn.
InnkeeperMr...... ? Your party is waiting for you on the 2nd floor.
 heads upstairs to find everyone waiting.
Aeris, you're late!
BarretYo man, you're late!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
AerisGuess everyone's here now.
BarretSo let's hear your story......You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the planet.Let's hear it all.
......I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER.After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became friends.
BarretYou call that a friend?
Yeah, well......He's older than me, and he hardly ever talked about himself.
Tifa.........
So I guess you'd call him a war buddy...... We trusted each other. Until one day......
Aeris...one day?
After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance against the Shinra.......that was 5 years ago.I was 16......
A flashback sequence begins.  and Sephiroth are riding in the back of a truck with two Shinra infantrymen.
It sure is raining hard.
He walks to one of the infantrymen.
Hey, how are you doing?
SoldierI'm all right.
I wouldn't know...I've never had motion sickness.
He walks to the other infantrymen.
Everything okay?
SephirothHey.Settle down.
 (doing squats)They gave me some new Materia.I can't wait to use it.
Sephiroth...just like a kid.
You going to brief us about this mission?
Sephiroth...this isn't a typical mission.
Good!
SephirothWhy do you say that?
I joined SOLDIER so I could be like you.But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over.My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war.That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind of a way to prove myself.Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?
Sephiroth...I thought you wanted a briefing?
 scratches his head.
SephirothOur mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor.There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing brutal creatures.First, we will dispose of those creatures. Then, we'll locate the problem and neutralize it.
Brutal creatures... Where?
SephirothThe Mako Reactor at Nibelheim.
Nibelheim...That's where I'm from.
SephirothHmm... hometown...
There is a loud thud.
DriverSir... s, something strange just crashed into our truck!
Sephiroth stands.
SephirothThat would be our Monster...
Sephiroth and  go outside to fight the green dragon that attacked the truck. Sephiroth kills it in a few hits.
Sephiroth's strength is unreal. He is far stronger in reality than any story you might have heard about him.
AerisSo... Where do you come in?
Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought.
Tifa.........
......and then we reached Nibelheim.
Another flashback sequence opens: Sephiroth approaches the gate to Nibelheim, then turns around to face the others, who are still off-screen behind him.
SephirothHow does it feel?It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?So how does it feel?I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown...
Ummm... how 'bout your parents?
SephirothMy mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father...
He laughs and shakes his head.
What does it matter...?All right, let's go.
The others approach and stop before the gate.
SoldierPsst... (You keep wandering around here and you'll get in trouble.)
Soldier 2It's so boring, being on watch.
- You want to do what we always do?- Just sit tight, it's your job, right?

You want to do what we always do?
Shall we practice?
Soldier 2Practice... oh, you mean practice my pose.Does someone in SOLDIER always have to be careful about what other people think?...How did it go?
He strikes a pose.
...Was it like this?
While they're talking, the other soldier perks up and strikes the same pose.
Good job!
Soldier 2I really don't want to be in SOLDIER.


Just sit tight, it's your job, right?
I'll come and talk to you once in a while. Just stick with it.

SephirothThe Mako smell is pretty bad here.
BarretYou wait a minute!!Isn't that, um...?The name of Sephiroth's mother...I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the Shinra building.
That's right.
TifaBarret, would you please let us hear what  has to say? You can ask questions later.
BarretTifa, I was only......
TifaOkay , continue.
AerisIt's a reunion of childhood pals!
......I was really surprised with Tifa.
 (narrating)...The town was quiet.Everyone must be staying in their houses, afraid to come out because of the monsters.No, maybe they're afraid of us...
In the flashback sequence, Sephiroth and  are standing just outside the inn.
SephirothWe leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep early.
He heads for the door, then stops and turns back.
All we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest.
One of the soldiers runs in from the gate, stopping just behind .
SephirothOh, that's right...You may visit your family and friends.
Sephiroth goes inside just as a man runs out of the neighboring house.
Man with CameraI heard Sephiroth was coming and got my camera ready.I want a shot of Sephiroth and a monster.
- Take my picture.- Better get back in the house, it's dangerous.

Take my picture.
Man with CameraI don't take pictures with nobodys.


Better get back in the house, it's dangerous.
Man with CameraAll right... So big-headed...Hey? This guy's a real...You... Are you ?Really? So that's how it is, huh?Gosh, , you've grown up to be a nice-looking lad.
- Then take my picture- It's dangerous, get back in your house

Then take my picture
Man with cameraLet's do this, . Let me take a picture of you with Sephiroth.


It's dangerous, get back in your house
Man with CameraOK, OK,...... So big-headed... You're just his assistant


SoldierMan... I'm so nervous.
- How come?- I'm excited.

How come?
SoldierLook, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?


I'm excited.
Soldier...That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero...

Inside the house next to the inn...
WomanWelcome.Hey? Aren't you...
Flash of white. The woman disappears.
...Have I come here before?...I don't remember.
BarretNow you're pissin' me off!! This don't matter, so get on with it!
Once  emerges, the soldier is now walking around the square, pausing to look at the water tower, Tifa's house, and 's house.  walks up to the Shinra mansion.
This Mansion......No, I'll come here later.
Tifa's father is standing near the mansion.
Tifa's FatherHmm? You from Shinra?
- That's right!- Who are you?

That's right!
Tifa's FatherGeez... Big-headed young kid.


Who are you?
Tifa's FatherI'm the town's... ...... ......!?Aren't you ?Don't you know me?
You're Tifa's...
Tifa's FatherRight. I'm Tifa's father....I want you to stay away from my daughter.We don't need the Shinra's help to protect our town!

If  tries to go up the path towards the mountain...
Up ahead is... Mt. Nibel.I'll tell you about the time I went into the mountains.
 goes to his house across the street.
This is...... my house. It has nothing to do with that incident five years ago.
BarretYo wait, I wanna hear.
AerisMe too! It's been a long time, right?
BarretTell us more!You saw your family, right?
- Don't want to talk about it- All right......

Don't want to talk about it
BarretWell I ain't gonna force ya...


All right......
I don't know if you could call it a 'family'......My father... died when I was still very young.That's why my mom...... was living alone in this house.Yeah, I saw my mom.My mom... she was a vibrant woman. Hadn't changed at all.But a few days later, she died...But when I saw her, she looked fine.

Back in the flashback,  walks farther into his house.
Uh...?
's MomYe----s?
She runs over.
!?Welcome home, !
Hi, mom.
Flash of white noise.
's MomCome, come... Let me take a look at you!Hmmm......You look so handsome.So this is a SOLDIER uniform?
......Mom, I...
Flash.  is now lying on the bed.
's MomMy, how you've grown.I'll bet the girls never leave you alone.
...Not really.
's Mom...I'm worried about you.There are a lot of temptations in the city...I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice girlfriend.
...I'm all right.
's MomYou should have...an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you.I think that would be the perfect type for you.
......I'm not interested.
Flash. They're now standing in the kitchen.
's MomAre you eating right?
I'm all right. The Company takes care of me.
's MomIs that so?You can't cook, right?I was worried sick about how you were doing...
Flash.
's Mom...?
Flash.
's MomYou know, ......
Flash.
's Mom......isn't that right, ?
Flash.
's MomI will always be your mother...
The screen fades to black.
 (narrating)......Let's stop this......
The image returns, with  just outside his house. If he tries to go back inside...
Hey...I can't... remember much else. There's... nothing more to talk about.
AerisThat's all right, .
 goes into Tifa's house.
Tifa...?Did you go into my house?
- Yeah...- No...

Yeah...
I thought you might be home.


No...
I remember you weren't there.

 walks up to Tifa's room.
Tifa...?Did you go into my room?
- Yeah......- No...
He walks to her piano.
TifaDid you play my piano?
- No, I didn't- Yeah, I jammed on it- Just a little

No, I didn't
Nothing happens.


Yeah, I jammed on it
...Now how did this go?- I forgot- I remember
 plays on the piano a bit. If you play the FF7 main theme, he'll say:
I've heard this melody somewhere before. Managed to play well...


Just a little
I can read sheet music too, you know...... Ummm, let's see......Do... Re... Mi... Ti... La... Do... Re... Mi... So... Fa.. Do.. Re... Do... Forget...

 walks to Tifa's desk.
The letter...
TifaDid you read it? My letter?
- I'd never do that!- Yeah...

I'd never do that!
TifaOf course!


Yeah...
TifaDo you remember what it said...?
- I don't remember...- I remember clearly

I don't remember...
TifaThen, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.


I remember clearly
I read it...It was a letter addressed to Tifa from the son of the guy that runs the General Store...
LetterTifa, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago.Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only person that we couldn't get a hold of was .But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway.Well, enough about him.Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so behind on everything... so out of it.Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean.Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some money....but, to do that, I guess I have to find a job first. That's right. I still haven't found a job yet.I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with Shinra, Inc.I wonder if it's too late to go back. Sometimes I think I should've taken over my parents' store.
Tifa... Do you remember all of it?
- No, that's it- Yeah, I remember it all

No, that's it
TifaThen, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.


Yeah, I remember it all
Because there was some stuff about me...
LetterI just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is Nibelheim.Hey, Tifa... Is that stupid old water tower still working?Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked?And most of all, how are you, Tifa? It feels like I haven't seen you for years.We were all talking about you last night.Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I couldn't very well stab them in the back.I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being jilted.Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter!So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again.P.S. Write me back, okay?



 walks to the dresser.
Received ""Orthopedic Underwear!""
Tifa!!!
- It's true- Just kidding. Don't get mad...
Tifa (she says the same thing regardless)...We're talking about something really important here.
Inside the neighboring house...
Black-haired Woman...Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome.Oh, I'm sorry! It's you, ! I didn't recognize you.
Two kids come running in.
GirlShinra----?
BoyChinra---?
GirlSOLDIER?
BoySaltza?
GirlAre you going to kill the monsters?
Boy......are you going to?
GirlHe's soooo cool!!
BoyWay cool!!
Black-haired Woman, you've grown to be a strong man.
Boy........................
GirlDo your best.
BoyDo your best.
 enters the inn.
GrampsSo, what do you need, ?
- Where's Sephiroth?- Give me a room to stay.- Let me know the situation of the town.

Where's Sephiroth?
GrampsYeah, he's upstairs.


Give me a room to stay.
GrampsIt's all reserved for you Shinra people, so I don't mind. But, wouldn't you feel more comfortable staying at home?


Let me know the situation of the town.
GrampsNow about the town...A lot of monsters have been appearing in the last 12 months.Other than that, there's not much change. Nothing much exciting happens in a little town like this.It was all right when they were building the reactor....while they were still building it.But once it was completed, it's been bad.Within a few years, all the trees on the mountain withered away.I don't know if the reactor was good or bad...I mean it's easy to say that it was a bad idea now. But now, what can you do about it...?Anyhow we've got to get rid of the monsters...Then, we'll all be able to relax a little bit.

Zangan......HmmmmIs Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?
And who are you?
ZanganI'm Zangan. I travel around the world teaching children martial arts.I have 128 students all over the world!In this town, a girl named Tifa is my student.
Did you say Tifa?
ZanganTifa has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter.I want to see some Shinra techniques.And if you see anything you can use, you might want to incorporate some of my techniques.Well, good luck.
If you go back outside to talk to the soldier again...
SoldierHey, if you don't calm down, you won't get a good evaluation...
 goes to the second floor of the inn to find Sephiroth standing by a window, staring out. While they're talking, the infantryman from the square comes up the stairs and enters the room.
What are you looking at?
Sephiroth...This scenery...... I feel like I know this place.
Soldier (inside the room)We're short one bed...
Sephiroth............We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon.
- It's still early- Yeah, let's get some sleep.

It's still early
Sephiroth...I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow.


Yeah, let's get some sleep.
SephirothI've hired a guide to the Mako reactor.I've heard she's young, I hope we can rely on her...

The next day,  wakes late and runs out to join Sephiroth and the two soldiers at the start of the mountain path, just past the mansion. A few of the townsfolk are hanging around, too.
If  goes back to the inn instead...
GrampsSo, what do you need, ?
- Where's Sephiroth?- Give me a room to stay.- Let me know the situation of the town.

Where's Sephiroth?
Gramps...I think you probably know better than I do, but...


Let me know the situation of the town.
GrampsIt's the same story I always tell. You still want to hear it?
- Yeah, tell me again- No, that's all right

Inside the house next to the inn...
WomanWelcome.Oh, oh, you're...
Flash of white. The woman disappears. The same dialogue from earlier repeats and  is standing back outside.
Inside the house next to Tifa's...
Black-haired WomanHave a safe trip.
If you try to enter the mansion...
SephirothHey, stay over here!
Man with CameraThink they'd let me take a picture?
Tifa's FatherIf I knew this was going to happen, I would've made mountain climbing off limits...
SoldierI was so nervous. I couldn't get any sleep...
Soldier 2...Late again.
If you try to go past them up the mountain path...
SephirothHey, calm down! Wait over here.
SephirothOnce the guide gets here, we're heading out.
Tifa's FatherListen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens...
Tifa comes running up while he's speaking.
Sephiroth...Trust me.
TifaI'll be all right, Dad!I have two men from SOLDIER with me.I'm Tifa. Nice to meet you!
Tifa! You're the guide?
TifaThat's right.I just happen to be the number one guide in this town.
It's too dangerous! I can't involve you in something like this!
SephirothThen there's no problem if you protect her....Let's go.
Man with CameraUmmm...Mr. Sephiroth! Please let me take one picture for a memento!Tifa, can you ask him for me too......?
 and Tifa both pose in front of the mansion. Sephiroth reluctantly walks over.
Man with CameraCheeeeese!
He snaps a picture, and Sephiroth walks away immediately after.
Man with CameraGreat, thank you!I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed!
They start out up the path to Mt. Nibel...
 (narrating)A Mako Reactor was built in Mt. Nibel.The cold air of the mountains of Nibel. It was no different...
If  runs back to town instead of following Tifa...
Tifa's FatherI hate myself for asking you this, but...Don't take your eyes off of Tifa! Hurry up and go back to her side!
GrampsHey, you want to rest?
- Yes, please- Forget it

Yes, please
GrampsIt's already been paid for. Go on, get some rest.


Forget it
Nothing happens.

ZanganOh? Did you come crying home?
Up on Mount Nibel,  follows Tifa onto a rickety-looking rope bridge.
TifaIt gets harder from here! Follow me!
SoldierLet's hurry.
 and the soldiers start across after her.
TifaUh... the bridge!!
The bridge creaks and then snaps, and they all fall to the rocks below.  and Tifa land near each other and get up. Sephiroth and one of the soldiers come around the bend to join them.
SephirothEveryone seems to be all right. Can we get back to where we were?
TifaThese caves are intertwined, just like an ant farm...Oh, and Sephiroth... There seems to be one person missing...
SephirothIt may sound cold, but we've got no time to search for him. We can't go back now, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here.
They continue on, entering some multi-colored caves.
What's this?
TifaA mysteriously colored cave...
SephirothIt must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here.
Coming out of the caves into the light, they find a Mako fountain.
...And what's this?
SephirothA Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature.
TifaIt's so beautiful...
She walks up to it.
If the Mako Reactor continues to suck up the energy, this fountain will dry up too...
The others walk over to join her.
SephirothMateria. When you condense Mako energy, materia is produced.It's very rare to be able to see materia in its natural state.
By the way... Why is it that when you use materia you can also use magic too?
SephirothYou were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that?...the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the materia.Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the Land and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the planet calling up magic...... or so they say.
Magic...... a mysterious power...
SephirothHa, ha, ha!
Did I say somethin' funny?
SephirothA man once told me never to use an unscientific term such as mysterious power! It shouldn't even be called 'magic'!I still remember how angry he was.
Who was that?
SephirothHojo of Shinra, Inc. ... An inexperienced man assigned to take over the work of a great scientist.He was a walking mass of complexes.
TifaA Mako fountain... So this is where the knowledge of the Ancients is.
They continue on and reach the Mako Reactor.
TifaWe finally made it. We sure took the long way though.
Tifa, you wait here.
TifaI'm going inside too! I wanna see!
 shakes his head.
SephirothOnly authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of Shinra's industrial secrets.
TifaBut!
Sephiroth turns to the soldier.
SephirothTake care of the lady.
The soldier nods and moves to block Tifa's way up the stairs as  and Sephiroth go on inside.
TifaMm, man!Better take real good care of me then!
Beyond the initial entry over the Mako pit, there is a large chamber. Inside are a number of strange pods, and at the top of some stairs there is a door marked Jenova. Sephiroth is standing before it, shaking his head.  joins him.
This is...... Jenova, right? The lock won't open...
Sephiroth goes down the stairs and  follows.
SephirothThis is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken., close the valve.Did you close the valve?
 closes the valve.
SephirothWhy did it break...?
He pulls himself up to look in the window of one of the pods.
...now I see, Hojo.But, even doing this, will never put you on the same level as Professor Gast.This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy... that is, when it's working correctly.Now... what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?
Uh, umm...... Oh yeah! It becomes a Materia.
SephirothRight, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. ...Take a look.Look through the window.
 pulls himself up to look. Upon seeing the monster inside, he falls back.
Wh... what is this!?
SephirothNormal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered with Mako.You're different from the others, but still human.But, what are they? They've been exposed to a high degree of Mako, far more than you.
 gets to his feet.
...is this some kind of monster?
SephirothExactly. And it's Hojo of Shinra that produced these monsters.Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what these monster's really are.
Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?
Sephiroth clutches his head as though in pain.
H... hey, Sephiroth!
SephirothN... no.........Was I?
He starts slashing at the pods with the Masamune, and  leaps back.
Sephiroth...Was I created this way too?Am I the same as all these monsters......
...Sephiroth.
SephirothYou saw it! All of them... were humans...
Human!? No way!
Sephiroth...I've always felt since I was small...That I was different from the others. Special, in some way.But... not like this...
He twists to look as one of the monsters suddenly bursts out of its pod and lies moaning. The scene fades.
 (narrating)Am I...... human?I didn't quite understand what Sephiroth was saying at that time.I was even more surprised by the fact that Shinra was producing monsters.
BarretDamn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!
Tifa......who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret like that.
Red XIIIThat would seem to explain the increase in the number of monsters recently.I think we should listen carefully to . Don't you think so Barret?
Barret(Why you talkin' to me!?)
- Save game and take a rest- Keep talking

Save game and take a rest
BarretYeah, mebbe so. Wanna take a breather here?


Keep talking
Nothing special happens.

Barret......I get it.
AerisTifa... You were waiting outside then?
Tifa......Yes.
We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself at the inn. He didn't even try to talk to me.
TifaThen all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?
We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim.
TifaThe villagers used to call it Shinra mansion.
Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion...
Flashback scene:  and the soldier join Zangan, Tifa, Tifa's father, and the man with the camera at the gate to the Shinra mansion.  looks around at all of them, nods, and proceeds to the mansion. He can turn back to talk to them, but they bar his path into the rest of the village.
Man with CameraWhat's Sephiroth doing?
ZanganThere's nothing that'll harm the town, right?
- Why...?- No way!

Why...?
...Why do you ask?
ZanganThe Shinra showed up to eliminate any information that could be an embarrassment to the company...You pick these things up when you travel as much as I do.


No way!
It's Sephiroth. He would never do that.
Zangan...Oh my. You sure do have faith.

Tifa's FatherUntil we know that there's no danger, we're not moving.
 goes inside on his own and finds the soldier outside one of the bedrooms.
SoldierThere's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this room...
 goes into the room and finds the hidden door that leads down into the basement. At the end of the hall is a library, where he finds Sephiroth pacing while he reads.
Sephiroth...an organism that was apparently dead, was found in a 2000 year old geological stratum.Professor Gast named that organism, Jenova...X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova confirmed to be an Ancient...X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova Project approved. The use of Mako Reactor 1 approved for use...
Sephiroth stops in the hallway and lowers the book, looking up.
My mother's name is Jenova... Jenova Project... Is this just a coincidence?Professor Gast... Why didn't you tell me anything? ...Why did you die?
 approaches him.
SephirothLet me be alone.
 leaves the library.
 (narrating)Sephiroth didn't come out of the Shinra Mansion...He continued to read as if he were possessed by something, and not once, did the light in the basement go out......
 wakes in another bedroom of the Shinra mansion. He walks across the mansion to the basement entrance.
SoldierSephiroth seems different.
 goes down to the basement and down the hall to the library.
SephirothHa, ha, ha......
 continues to the study in the back, where he finds Sephiroth seated behind the desk.
SephirothWho is it!?Hmph... traitor.
Traitor?
Sephiroth stands.
SephirothYou ignorant traitor. I'll tell you.This Planet originally belonged to the Cetra. Cetra was a itinerant race. They would migrate in, settle the Planet, then move on...At the end of their harsh, hard journey, they would find the Promised Land and supreme happiness.But, those that disliked the journey appeared. Those who stopped their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life.They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without giving back one whit in return!Those are your ancestors.
Sephiroth...
SephirothLong ago, disaster struck this planet.Your ancestors escaped... They survived because they hid.The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your ancestors continued to increase.Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports.
What does that have to do with you?
SephirothDon't you get it?An Ancient named Jenova was found in the geological stratum of 2000 years ago.The Jenova Project.The Jenova Project wanted to produce people with the powers of the Ancients...... no, the Cetra....I am the one that was produced.
Pr... produced!?
SephirothYes.Professor Gast, leader of the Jenova Project and genius scientist, produced me.
How... how did he...?Se... Sephiroth?
SephirothOut of my way. I'm going to see my mother.
Sephiroth leaves the library.  runs out of the mansion after him, only to find the village below in flames. Trying to walk through the flames to the north will trigger a voice.
He---y! Is anyone here?
 starts into the village.
ZanganHey it's you! You're still sane, right?
 nods.
ZanganThen come over here and help me!I'll check this house. You check that one over there!
He runs into the general store.
Man with Camera (lying on ground)...Hey,Ummm... Am I going to die?
Soldier (lying near 's house)...Sephi... roth
 runs into his house, but comes out again right after, shaking his head.
Terrible...Sephiroth... This is too terrible...
 turns to see Sephiroth cutting down villagers with the Masamune. Sephiroth turns and walks away through the flames.  runs after him. He arrives at the Mako reactor to find Tifa kneeling by her father's body. The Masamune lies nearby.
TifaPapa...Sephiroth!?Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything!I hate them all!
She takes up Sephiroth's sword and runs inside. Sephiroth is standing before the door to Jenova's chamber.
SephirothMother, I'm here to see you. Please, open this door.
Tifa approaches with the Masamune.
TifaHow could you do that to papa and all the townspeople?
She climbs the stairs and raises the sword over her head to attack him, but Sephiroth pulls the Masamune from her grasp and slashes her. She falls down the stairs, landing near  as he runs in. The door to Jenova's chamber opens, and Sephiroth turns and enters.  kneels to gather Tifa in his arms.
Tifa...You promised... You promised that you'd come...... when I was in trouble...
He carries her to the side and sets her down, then runs inside Jenova's chamber to confront Sephiroth.
SephirothMother, let's take this planet back together.I've thought of a great idea. Let's go to the Promised Land.
Sephiroth...My family! My hometown! How could you do this to them!?
SephirothHa, ha, ha...... They've come again, mother.With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was destined to become the ruler of this Planet.But they...Those worthless creaturesare stealing the planet from MotherBut now I'm here with youso don't worry
He reaches up and tears off the mechanical angel figure from the front of Jenova's glass tank, revealing Jenova itself inside.
What about MY sadness!? My family... friends... The sadness of having my hometown taken away from me!?It's the same as your sadness!
SephirothHa, ha, ha... my sadness? What do I have to be sad about?I am the chosen one. I have been chosen to be the leader of this Planet.I have orders to take this planet back from you stupid people for the Cetra. What am I supposed to be sad about?
Sephiroth... I trusted you...No, you're not the Sephiroth I used to know!
 and Sephiroth face off, and the screen goes white.
......and that's the end of my story.
BarretWait a damn minute! Ain't there more?
......I don't remember.
AerisWhat happened to Sephiroth?
In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him.
TifaOfficial records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the newspaper.
AerisShinra, Inc. owns the paper, so you can't rely on that information.
......I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened then.I challenged Sephiroth and lived. Why didn't he kill me?
Tifa......I'm alive, too.
AerisSeems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? It was in the Shinra building, right?
Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar.
AerisDid someone else carry it out after that? It was missing from the Shinra building.
TifaSephiroth......?
BarretDamn! Don't none of this make sense!I'm going, going, going, gone!And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!Yo, ! Let's get a move on!
- Wait a sec- Right

Wait a sec
Barret, what's wrong? You just gonna stand there while Sephiroth heads for the Promised Land?I ain't lettin' Sephiroth or Shinra get to no Promised Land. If they do, then we're all screwed.Y'know what I'm sayin'!
- Beautiful, just beautiful!- Is that all?

Beautiful, just beautiful
BarretY'all jes leave it to me!


Is that all?
Oh brother......
BarretFine! That's good enough.



Right
BarretYo, c'mon let's go!

Barret runs down the stairs.
Oh brother......
Tifa............?How bad was I when Sephiroth cut me?
I thought you were a goner. ......I was really sad.
Tifa.........
AerisI...The Ancients...... Cetra...... Jenova...... Sephiroth and myself......
TifaLet's go. Barret's waiting.
, Aeris, and Tifa head downstairs.
Red XIIIWhat a fascinating story......
They all join Barret downstairs.

BarretYo, . Here.
Aeris. Take this.
TifaOh, . Let me give you this.

Received ""PHS""!

AerisWith [PHS], I can see you any time!
TifaJust use [PHS], and you can contact any one of us easy.
Red XIII[PHS], will put us in constant contact with each other.


BarretAwright then, we're outta here.
AerisWell, I'll be going.
TifaI'm going on ahead.

Innkeeper20 gil a night. What's it gonna be?
- Stay?- Move on
Innkeeper (she only says anything if you don't have enough gil)Seems like you're a little short. Why don't you drop by again... when you have money.
 and the others leave the inn.
RedheadListen to me! Just now, some guy in a black cloak goes walked east towards that grassy field.And he's got this killer sword, and is looking REAL scary......
With that as their first clue,  and the others set out across the grasslands.

< The Shinra Building | Kalm | The Road to Junon >"
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Hey Cloud. If we keep going, we'll never get to Kalm."
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Hey, Cloud. Wasn't Kalm right before this cavern?"
Red XIII,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...We won't get to Kalm even if we go through these caverns.
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yo, wassup? Can't SOLDIER-man even lead the way?"
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Cloud! Are you lost!?
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Kalm should be closer to Midgar.
Red XIII,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"If we're planning to meet at Kalm, we should go back and look for it again."
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,This is Kalm.
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,We've reached Kalm.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,So this is Kalm?
Red XIII,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......looks like we've reached Kalm.
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yo, I'll be waitin' at the inn... Hurry up and get your butt over there!"
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I wonder if everyone's there already. Let's hurry over to the inn!
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Everyone's waiting at the inn. Let's go Cloud.
Red XIII,Kalm - Cloud's Story,We're supposed to meet at the inn. ......Shall we go?
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Get over here!
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Well then, I'll go on ahead."
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Let's go Cloud.
Red XIII,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Let's go Cloud.
Redhead,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Aw, c'mon! listen to me! Got anything interesting to say?......"
Old Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Thanks to Shinra, Inc. developing Mako energy for us, everything's more convenient now.Maybe a little too convenient."
Black-haired Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Tourists, huh?There are some things you should know that'll come in handy when you travel around the world......Want me to tell you what they are?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Tell me- I already know
Black-haired Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Then let me explain how to use the world map.Well then, what do you want to know?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Changing the camera angle- Map indicators- Operating the buttons
Black-haired Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"First of all, press the [L2 button] on the controller to change the camera angle.There are 2 angles to choose from, select the one you like.You can then rotate the angles either way by pressing the [L1 button] and [R1 button].Try different angles until you find the one you like best. It makes the journey a lot more fun!Anything else you'd like to know?"
Black-haired Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Press the [Start button] once to view the World Map.There is a large and small map. Learn when to use which, and you won't get lost as much.Push the [Start button] twice to change the size of the map, and once more to turn it off.Pretty easy, huh?Anything else you want to ask?"
Black-haired Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"You can ride things by pressing the [SELECT button] and get off by pressing the [cancel button]. This isn't so hard, either!Oh, yes, yes. You can't dash with the World Map on, so make sure not to press the [cancel button] unless you get off.Remember this because Chocobos will run away as soon as you get off them, so be careful.Anything else you want to ask?"
Black-haired Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Once on the World Map you can access the menu to save your game anywhere. It's a good idea to save frequently!Well then, bon voyage!"
Black-haired Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Is that so? Well, that's that. Have a nice trip."
Man in Blue,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I hear that the natural resources near the reactors are being sucked dry.We're better off with them bringing in the Mako energy.
Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"I heard President Shinra was killed. And his son Rufus, the new president, was badly hurt.Hey, I bet that's news to you?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Hey you're pretty clued!!- Don't care...
Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Heh, heh, heh...... This is just between us. I heard it was that there Ava-whaddya call-ums that attacked the President Shinra and his son."
Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Don't care? If you're going to travel, you'd best keep an eye on what Shinra's doing."
Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Shinra is leading the world around by the nose, and you guys are just gonna sit back and take it?"
Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"The famous floating city, Midgar... Just once I'd love to see it in person.South of this town past the Mythril Mine and far to the west is a Shinra harbor called Junon.They say there's a reactor and many tall buildings there. I hope to see it someday."
Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Thanks to Mako energy, life's pretty darn convenient. Thanks to Shinra.Don't you think?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- Yeah, maybe- You're full of it"
Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,See!? How would we get by without Mako energy?
Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Hmmn. But I'd hate to think of what life'd be like without Mako energy.
Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yeah, Mako energy's made our lives much easier. And it's all thanks to Shinra, Inc."
Girl Upstairs,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Mako energy's made things a lot more convenient......But seems like a lot of plants and animals have been disappearing at a rapid pace.I think the old life was better.Don't you think so?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- Yeah, maybe- No way"
Girl Upstairs,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yeah, sure I'm right! You think so, don't you?"
Girl Upstairs,Kalm - Cloud's Story,That sounds just like what my mom says.
Girl Upstairs,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I thought things were better when I was able to play with animals......
Old Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Did you say you came from Midgar?I used to live there, too. But I hear they got lots of troubles lately."
Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,There was a suspicious-looking man in a black cloak! He was carrying a wicked-looking sword.Why doesn't anyone believe me? I'm all alone...
Girl,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......My older brother's so stupid. He's so embarrassing I could just puke!
Boy,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"When I grow up I'm gonna be in SOLDIER. That's why I'm training hard now!!Hyah, hayah, eagghh!"
Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Is it true that Shinra made a Monster?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- It's true- Just a rumor
Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"(she says the same thing regardless)Yeah, well either way, as long as we're using the reactor, we can't stand up to Shinra."
Kalm Traveler,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"The world's at peace... all's well.I got my health, and enough to eat... all's well."
Kid outside Bar,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"My old man was a miner, but he couldn't go to work after monsters started appearing in the Mythril Mine.Now all he does is sit around getting drunk in the bar..."
Person in Blue,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"I heard terrorists bombed a Midgar reactor...There sure have been a lot of dangerous accidents recently. I hate it, just hate it."
Man,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Me? I used to work in a coal mine down south called Mythril MineBut, right around then, monsters started appearing.After that, business went to pot and now I spend the days here drinking.Urrrp! ...hic... I'm stinking drunk!!"
Bartender,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"It seems there was this group called AVALANCHE runnin' around, but I guess they finally got wiped out by SOLDIER.Shinra is trying to eliminate anyone, who stands up to them.It don't matter if we like it or not. Shinra's taken over, and we gotta live with it!"
Cook,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Stay out of the kitchen.
Item Shopkeeper,Kalm - Cloud's Story,This is the Item Store.
Materia Shopkeeper,Kalm - Cloud's Story,This is the Materia Store.
Weapons Shopkeeper,Kalm - Cloud's Story,This is the Weapons Store.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Barret and the others are waiting for us at the inn.
Innkeeper,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Mr...... Cloud? Your party is waiting for you on the 2nd floor.
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Cloud, you're late!"
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yo man, you're late!"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Sorry to keep you waiting.
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Guess everyone's here now.
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"So let's hear your story......You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the planet.Let's hear it all."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"......I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER.After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became friends."
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,You call that a friend?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yeah, well......He's older than me, and he hardly ever talked about himself."
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,.........
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,So I guess you'd call him a war buddy...... We trusted each other. Until one day......
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...one day?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance against the Shinra.......that was 5 years ago.I was 16......
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,It sure is raining hard.
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I'm all right.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I wouldn't know...I've never had motion sickness.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Hey.Settle down.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,(doing squats)They gave me some new Materia.I can't wait to use it.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...just like a kid.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,You going to brief us about this mission?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...this isn't a typical mission.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Good!
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Why do you say that?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"I joined SOLDIER so I could be like you.But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over.My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war.That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind of a way to prove myself.Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?"
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...I thought you wanted a briefing?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor.There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing brutal creatures.First, we will dispose of those creatures. Then, we'll locate the problem and neutralize it."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Brutal creatures... Where?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Nibelheim...That's where I'm from.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Hmm... hometown...
Driver,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Sir... s, something strange just crashed into our truck!"
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,That would be our Monster...
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Sephiroth's strength is unreal. He is far stronger in reality than any story you might have heard about him.
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,So... Where do you come in?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,.........
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......and then we reached Nibelheim.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"How does it feel?It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?So how does it feel?I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown..."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Ummm... how 'bout your parents?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father...
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Psst... (You keep wandering around here and you'll get in trouble.)
Soldier 2,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"It's so boring, being on watch."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- You want to do what we always do?- Just sit tight, it's your job, right?"
Soldier 2,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Practice... oh, you mean practice my pose.Does someone in SOLDIER always have to be careful about what other people think?...How did it go?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Good job!
Soldier 2,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I really don't want to be in SOLDIER.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,The Mako smell is pretty bad here.
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"You wait a minute!!Isn't that, um...?The name of Sephiroth's mother...I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the Shinra building."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,That's right.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Barret, would you please let us hear what Cloud has to say? You can ask questions later."
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Tifa, I was only......"
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Okay Cloud, continue."
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,It's a reunion of childhood pals!
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......I was really surprised with Tifa.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"(narrating)...The town was quiet.Everyone must be staying in their houses, afraid to come out because of the monsters.No, maybe they're afraid of us..."
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep early.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Oh, that's right...You may visit your family and friends."
Man with Camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I heard Sephiroth was coming and got my camera ready.I want a shot of Sephiroth and a monster.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- Take my picture.- Better get back in the house, it's dangerous."
Man with Camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I don't take pictures with nobodys.
Man with Camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"All right... So big-headed...Hey? This guy's a real...You... Are you Cloud?Really? So that's how it is, huh?Gosh, Cloud, you've grown up to be a nice-looking lad."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- Then take my picture- It's dangerous, get back in your house"
Man with camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Let's do this, Cloud. Let me take a picture of you with Sephiroth."
Man with Camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"OK, OK,...... So big-headed... You're just his assistant"
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Man... I'm so nervous.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- How come?- I'm excited.
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Look, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?"
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero...
Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Welcome.Hey? Aren't you...
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...Have I come here before?...I don't remember.
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Now you're pissin' me off!! This don't matter, so get on with it!"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"This Mansion......No, I'll come here later."
Tifa's Father,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Hmm? You from Shinra?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- That's right!- Who are you?
Tifa's Father,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Geez... Big-headed young kid.
Tifa's Father,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I'm the town's... ...... ......!?Aren't you Cloud?Don't you know me?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,You're Tifa's...
Tifa's Father,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Right. I'm Tifa's father....I want you to stay away from my daughter.We don't need the Shinra's help to protect our town!
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Up ahead is... Mt. Nibel.I'll tell you about the time I went into the mountains.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,This is...... my house. It has nothing to do with that incident five years ago.
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yo wait, I wanna hear."
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Me too! It's been a long time, right?"
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Tell us more!You saw your family, right?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Don't want to talk about it- All right......
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Well I ain't gonna force ya...
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Uh...?
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Ye----s?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Hi, mom."
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Come, come... Let me take a look at you!Hmmm......You look so handsome.So this is a SOLDIER uniform?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"......Mom, I..."
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"My, how you've grown.I'll bet the girls never leave you alone."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...Not really.
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...I'm worried about you.There are a lot of temptations in the city...I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice girlfriend.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...I'm all right.
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"You should have...an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you.I think that would be the perfect type for you."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......I'm not interested.
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Are you eating right?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I'm all right. The Company takes care of me.
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Is that so?You can't cook, right?I was worried sick about how you were doing..."
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Cloud...?
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"You know, Cloud......"
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"......isn't that right, Cloud?"
Cloud's Mom,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I will always be your mother...
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,(narrating)......Let's stop this......
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Hey...I can't... remember much else. There's... nothing more to talk about.
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"That's all right, Cloud."
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Cloud...?Did you go into my house?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Yeah...- No...
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Cloud...?Did you go into my room?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Yeah......- No...
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Did you play my piano?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- No, I didn't- Yeah, I jammed on it- Just a little"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,The letter...
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Did you read it? My letter?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- I'd never do that!- Yeah...
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Of course!
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Do you remember what it said...?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- I don't remember...- I remember clearly
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I read it...It was a letter addressed to Tifa from the son of the guy that runs the General Store...
Letter,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Tifa, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago.Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only person that we couldn't get a hold of was Cloud.But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway.Well, enough about him.Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so behind on everything... so out of it.Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean.Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some money....but, to do that, I guess I have to find a job first. That's right. I still haven't found a job yet.I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with Shinra, Inc.I wonder if it's too late to go back. Sometimes I think I should've taken over my parents' store."
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Cloud... Do you remember all of it?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- No, that's it- Yeah, I remember it all"
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth."
Letter,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is Nibelheim.Hey, Tifa... Is that stupid old water tower still working?Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked?And most of all, how are you, Tifa? It feels like I haven't seen you for years.We were all talking about you last night.Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I couldn't very well stab them in the back.I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being jilted.Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter!So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again.P.S. Write me back, okay?"
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Cloud!!!
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- It's true- Just kidding. Don't get mad...
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,(she says the same thing regardless)...CloudWe're talking about something really important here.
Black-haired Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"...Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome.Oh, I'm sorry! It's you, Cloud! I didn't recognize you."
Girl,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Shinra----?
Boy,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Chinra---?
Girl,Kalm - Cloud's Story,SOLDIER?
Boy,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Saltza?
Girl,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Are you going to kill the monsters?
Boy,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......are you going to?
Girl,Kalm - Cloud's Story,He's soooo cool!!
Boy,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Way cool!!
Black-haired Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Cloud, you've grown to be a strong man."
Boy,Kalm - Cloud's Story,........................
Girl,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Do your best.
Boy,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Do your best.
Gramps,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"So, what do you need, Cloud?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Where's Sephiroth?- Give me a room to stay.- Let me know the situation of the town.
Gramps,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yeah, he's upstairs."
Gramps,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"It's all reserved for you Shinra people, so I don't mind. But, wouldn't you feel more comfortable staying at home?"
Gramps,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Now about the town...A lot of monsters have been appearing in the last 12 months.Other than that, there's not much change. Nothing much exciting happens in a little town like this.It was all right when they were building the reactor....while they were still building it.But once it was completed, it's been bad.Within a few years, all the trees on the mountain withered away.I don't know if the reactor was good or bad...I mean it's easy to say that it was a bad idea now. But now, what can you do about it...?Anyhow we've got to get rid of the monsters...Then, we'll all be able to relax a little bit."
Zangan,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......HmmmmIs Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,And who are you?
Zangan,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"I'm . I travel around the world teaching children martial arts.I have 128 students all over the world!In this town, a girl named Tifa is my student."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Did you say Tifa?
Zangan,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Tifa has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter.I want to see some Shinra techniques.And if you see anything you can use, you might want to incorporate some of my techniques.Well, good luck."
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Hey, if you don't calm down, you won't get a good evaluation..."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,What are you looking at?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...This scenery...... I feel like I know this place.
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,(inside the room)We're short one bed...
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,............We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- It's still early- Yeah, let's get some sleep."
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"I've hired a guide to the Mako reactor.I've heard she's young, I hope we can rely on her..."
Gramps,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"So, what do you need, Cloud?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Where's Sephiroth?- Give me a room to stay.- Let me know the situation of the town.
Gramps,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"...I think you probably know better than I do, but..."
Gramps,Kalm - Cloud's Story,It's the same story I always tell. You still want to hear it?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- Yeah, tell me again- No, that's all right"
Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Welcome.Oh, oh, you're..."
Black-haired Woman,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Have a safe trip.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Hey, stay over here!"
Man with Camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Think they'd let me take a picture?
Tifa's Father,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"If I knew this was going to happen, I would've made mountain climbing off limits..."
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I was so nervous. I couldn't get any sleep...
Soldier 2,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...Late again.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Hey, calm down! Wait over here."
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Once the guide gets here, we're heading out."
Tifa's Father,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens..."
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...Trust me.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"I'll be all right, Dad!I have two men from SOLDIER with me.I'm . Nice to meet you!"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Tifa! You're the guide?
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,That's right.I just happen to be the number one guide in this town.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,It's too dangerous! I can't involve you in something like this!
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Then there's no problem if you protect her....Let's go.
Man with Camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Ummm...Mr. Sephiroth! Please let me take one picture for a memento!Tifa, can you ask him for me too......?"
Man with Camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Cheeeeese!
Man with Camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Great, thank you!I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed!"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,(narrating)A Mako Reactor was built in Mt. Nibel.The cold air of the mountains of Nibel. It was no different...
Tifa's Father,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"I hate myself for asking you this, but...Don't take your eyes off of Tifa! Hurry up and go back to her side!"
Gramps,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Hey, you want to rest?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- Yes, please- Forget it"
Gramps,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"It's already been paid for. Go on, get some rest."
Zangan,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Oh? Did you come crying home?
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,It gets harder from here! Follow me!
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Let's hurry.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Uh... the bridge!!
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Everyone seems to be all right. Can we get back to where we were?
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"These caves are intertwined, just like an ant farm...Oh, and Sephiroth... There seems to be one person missing..."
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"It may sound cold, but we've got no time to search for him. We can't go back now, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,What's this?
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,A mysteriously colored cave...
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...And what's this?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,It's so beautiful...
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Materia. When you condense Mako energy, materia is produced.It's very rare to be able to see materia in its natural state."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,By the way... Why is it that when you use materia you can also use magic too?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that?...the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the materia.Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the Land and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the planet calling up magic...... or so they say.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Magic...... a mysterious power...
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Ha, ha, ha!"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Did I say somethin' funny?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,A man once told me never to use an unscientific term such as mysterious power! It shouldn't even be called 'magic'!I still remember how angry he was.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Who was that?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Hojo of Shinra, Inc. ... An inexperienced man assigned to take over the work of a great scientist.He was a walking mass of complexes."
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,A Mako fountain... So this is where the knowledge of the Ancients is.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,We finally made it. We sure took the long way though.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Tifa, you wait here."
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I'm going inside too! I wanna see!
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of Shinra's industrial secrets.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,But!
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Take care of the lady.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Mm, man!Better take real good care of me then!"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"This is...... Jenova, right? The lock won't open..."
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken.Cloud, close the valve.Did you close the valve?"
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Why did it break...?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Uh, umm...... Oh yeah! It becomes a Materia."
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. ...Take a look.Look through the window."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Wh... what is this!?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered with Mako.You're different from the others, but still human.But, what are they? They've been exposed to a high degree of Mako, far more than you."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...is this some kind of monster?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Exactly. And it's Hojo of Shinra that produced these monsters.Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what these monster's really are.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"H... hey, Sephiroth!"
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,N... no.........Was I?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...Was I created this way too?Am I the same as all these monsters......
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...Sephiroth.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,You saw it! All of them... were humans...
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Human!? No way!
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"...I've always felt since I was small...That I was different from the others. Special, in some way.But... not like this..."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,(narrating)Am I...... human?I didn't quite understand what Sephiroth was saying at that time.I was even more surprised by the fact that Shinra was producing monsters.
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Damn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!"
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret like that.
Red XIII,Kalm - Cloud's Story,That would seem to explain the increase in the number of monsters recently.I think we should listen carefully to Cloud. Don't you think so Barret?
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,(Why you talkin' to me!?)
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Save game and take a rest- Keep talking
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yeah, mebbe so. Wanna take a breather here?"
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......I get it.
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Tifa... You were waiting outside then?
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......Yes.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself at the inn. He didn't even try to talk to me.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,The villagers used to call it Shinra mansion.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion..."
Man with Camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,What's Sephiroth doing?
Zangan,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"There's nothing that'll harm the town, right?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Why...?- No way!
Zangan,Kalm - Cloud's Story,The Shinra showed up to eliminate any information that could be an embarrassment to the company...You pick these things up when you travel as much as I do.
Zangan,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...Oh my. You sure do have faith.
Tifa's Father,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Until we know that there's no danger, we're not moving."
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this room..."
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"...an organism that was apparently dead, was found in a 2000 year old geological stratum.Professor Gast named that organism, Jenova...X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova confirmed to be an Ancient...X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova Project approved. The use of Mako Reactor 1 approved for use..."
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Let me be alone.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"(narrating)Sephiroth didn't come out of the Shinra Mansion...He continued to read as if he were possessed by something, and not once, did the light in the basement go out......"
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Sephiroth seems different.
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Ha, ha, ha......"
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Who is it!?Hmph... traitor.
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Traitor?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"You ignorant traitor. I'll tell you.This Planet originally belonged to the Cetra. Cetra was a itinerant race. They would migrate in, settle the Planet, then move on...At the end of their harsh, hard journey, they would find the Promised Land and supreme happiness.But, those that disliked the journey appeared. Those who stopped their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life.They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without giving back one whit in return!Those are your ancestors."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Sephiroth...
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Long ago, disaster struck this planet.Your ancestors escaped... They survived because they hid.The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your ancestors continued to increase.Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,What does that have to do with you?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Don't you get it?An Ancient named Jenova was found in the geological stratum of 2000 years ago.The Jenova Project.The Jenova Project wanted to produce people with the powers of the Ancients...... no, the Cetra....I am the one that was produced."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Pr... produced!?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yes.Professor Gast, leader of the Jenova Project and genius scientist, produced me."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,How... how did he...?Se... Sephiroth?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Out of my way. I'm going to see my mother.
Zangan,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Hey it's you! You're still sane, right?"
Zangan,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Then come over here and help me!I'll check this house. You check that one over there!
Man with Camera,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"(lying on ground)...Hey,Ummm... Am I going to die?"
Soldier,Kalm - Cloud's Story,(lying near Cloud's house)...Sephi... roth
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Terrible...Sephiroth... This is too terrible...
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Papa...Sephiroth!?Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything!I hate them all!"
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Mother, I'm here to see you. Please, open this door."
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,How could you do that to papa and all the townspeople?
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,...You promised... You promised that you'd come...... when I was in trouble...
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Mother, let's take this planet back together.I've thought of a great idea. Let's go to the Promised Land."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Sephiroth...My family! My hometown! How could you do this to them!?
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Ha, ha, ha...... They've come again, mother.With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was destined to become the ruler of this Planet.But they...Those worthless creaturesare stealing the planet from MotherBut now I'm here with youso don't worry"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,What about MY sadness!? My family... friends... The sadness of having my hometown taken away from me!?It's the same as your sadness!
Sephiroth,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Ha, ha, ha... my sadness? What do I have to be sad about?I am the chosen one. I have been chosen to be the leader of this Planet.I have orders to take this planet back from you stupid people for the Cetra. What am I supposed to be sad about?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Sephiroth... I trusted you...No, you're not the Sephiroth I used to know!"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......and that's the end of my story.
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Wait a damn minute! Ain't there more?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......I don't remember.
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,What happened to Sephiroth?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him."
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the newspaper.
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Shinra, Inc. owns the paper, so you can't rely on that information."
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,......I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened then.I challenged Sephiroth and lived. Why didn't he kill me?
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"......I'm alive, too."
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Seems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? It was in the Shinra building, right?"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar.
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Did someone else carry it out after that? It was missing from the Shinra building.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Sephiroth......?
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Damn! Don't none of this make sense!I'm going, going, going, gone!And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!Yo, Cloud! Let's get a move on!"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Wait a sec- Right
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Cloud, what's wrong? You just gonna stand there while Sephiroth heads for the Promised Land?I ain't lettin' Sephiroth or Shinra get to no Promised Land. If they do, then we're all screwed.Y'know what I'm sayin'!"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"- Beautiful, just beautiful!- Is that all?"
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Y'all jes leave it to me!
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Fine! That's good enough.
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yo, c'mon let's go!"
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Oh brother......
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,.........Cloud...?How bad was I when Sephiroth cut me?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I thought you were a goner. ......I was really sad.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,.........
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I...The Ancients...... Cetra...... Jenova...... Sephiroth and myself......
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Let's go. Barret's waiting.
Red XIII,Kalm - Cloud's Story,What a fascinating story......
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Yo, Cloud. Here."
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,Cloud. Take this.
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Oh, Cloud. Let me give you this."
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"With [PHS], I can see you any time!"
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Just use [PHS], and you can contact any one of us easy."
Red XIII,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"[PHS], will put us in constant contact with each other."
Barret,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Awright then, we're outta here."
Aeris,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Well, I'll be going."
Tifa,Kalm - Cloud's Story,I'm going on ahead.
Innkeeper,Kalm - Cloud's Story,20 gil a night. What's it gonna be?
Cloud,Kalm - Cloud's Story,- Stay?- Move on
Innkeeper,Kalm - Cloud's Story,(she only says anything if you don't have enough gil)Seems like you're a little short. Why don't you drop by again... when you have money.
Redhead,Kalm - Cloud's Story,"Listen to me! Just now, some guy in a black cloak goes walked east towards that grassy field.And he's got this killer sword, and is looking REAL scary......"
Chocobo,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Wark!Wark? Warkwark wark?
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- Wark- Warrrk
Chocobo,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Wark-----
Chocobo,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Wark!! Wark!!
Choco Bill,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Thinking of crossing the marshes?
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- Yeah- Not interested
Choco Bill,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Hmm, then it'll probably be safer for you to get a Chocobo.That way you can zip through the marshes with the Chocobo.It's the only way to avoid being attacked by the Midgar Zolom.Midgar Zolom...?It's a serpent-like creature over 30 feet tall!!It picks up on footsteps that enter the marshes...And then, BAM!! It attacks!!!To avoid that, buy a Chocobo at the  & y Chocobo Farm.To purchase a Chocobo, please talk to my grandson. He's in the Chocobo stables at the far right end of the farm.By the way, there was another person heading towards the Marshes.Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him. It was a man in a Black Cape."
Choco Bill,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Hmm, then, I guess that's that."
Choco Bill,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Looking for an Inn?
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- Yeah- Not interested
Choco Bill,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,How about 100 gil a night...?
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- All right- I'm in a hurry
Choco Bill,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Thank you for your patronage.
Choco Bill,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Hmm, then, I guess that's that."
Choco Bill,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Hmm, then, I guess that's that."
Chole,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Welcome.
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Do you want a Chocobo?
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Mmm......- Give me one- Nope
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,You old folks are out of luck!
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Old folks...?
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"We're all out of Chocobos. I'm taking care of those ones out there for someone else.You know, if you really want a Chocobo, you should go out and catch one.Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?"
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- Where are they?- How do I catch one?- What else?- Not interested
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"You see those claw prints out there? Wild Chocobo's will appear in those areas.But, if you don't have 'Chocobo Lure' they won't come out. They very cautious animals by nature."
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- Chocobo Lure?- Go on
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"'Chocobo Lure' is a type of materia which attracts Chocobos.If you equip this, they'll come to you. But, without it, they won't appear."
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"A wild Chocobo always appears with other monsters.But, you won't be able to catch it because of the monsters.That is why you must defeat the monsters first before you catch the Chocobo."
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- And then?- That all you can talk about?
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Also, wild Chocobos are really cautious. They'll run away from the slightest things.But, if you use 'Greens' They'll focus on that, and won't run away."
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Whatever you do, don't make Chocobos angry. They're usually calm, but if you get them angry, you'll get hurt.Oh, and remember, once you get off a Chocobo, it'll escape."
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Well then, shall we get down to business?I'll sell you the 'Chocobo Lure' for 2000 gil, right now.You want it?"
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- Buy it- Don't buy it
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Thanks!It wouldn't hurt to buy some 'Greens' either.Oh, and how fast a Chocobo'll finish eating depends of what type of 'Greens' you feed them."
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Mmmm, if you don't have it, you'll never catch one."
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,The 'Chocobo Lure' is 2000 gil. Buy it now?
Choco Billy,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Oh, I'm so glad!"
Chole,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Wasn't it really expensive?But don't be mad at my brother or Grandpa.Ever since dad and mom died, it's been like this..."
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Did Sephiroth... do this......?
Barret,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"This Sephiroth guy's pretty strong, I'd say."
Aeris,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Our enemy is someone that could do this...?
Tifa,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Amazing...
Red XIII,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,It's a power that we should respect...
Rude,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Just a second!
Barret,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Wh, who are you!?"
Aeris,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"By any chance, are you...?"
Tifa,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Who are you?
Red XIII,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,...... I hoped I'd never see you again...
Rude,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Do you know who I am?
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"- From the Turks, right?- Not interested"
Rude,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Well if you know, then this won't take long."
Rude,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,......I'm from the Turks. And don't you ever forget it.
Rude,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,It's difficult to explain what the Turks do...
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Kidnapping, right?"
Rude,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"To put it negatively... you could say that....But, that's not all there is to it, anymore........................."
Elena,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Sir!It's all right, Rude! I know you don't like speeches, so don't force it!"
Rude,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"...Then Elena, explain."
Elena,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"I'm the newest member of the Turks, . Thanks to what you did to Reno, we're short of people....Although, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks, ...In any case, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed.And to try and stop you every step of the way.Wait a minute, it's the other way around... You're the ones that are getting in our way."
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,...Elena. You talk too much.
Elena,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Mr. Tseng!?
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,No need to tell them about our orders.
Elena,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Sorry... Tseng.
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,I thought I gave you other orders.Now go. Don't forget to file your report.
Elena,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Oh! Right!Very well, Rude and I will go after Sephiroth, who's heading for Junon Harbor!"
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,...Elena. You don't seem to understand.
Elena,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Oh! I'm, I'm sorry..."
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,...Go. Don't let Sephiroth get away.
Rude & Elena,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Yes sir!
Rude,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,...Reno said he wanted to see you after the injuries you gave him healed.He wants to show his affection for you all... with a new weapon.
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Well, then..."
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Aeris... Long time no see.Looks like you got away from the Shinra for a while, now that Sephiroth reappeared."
Aeris,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,...so what are you saying? That I should be grateful to Sephiroth?
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"No...Well, I won't be seeing too much of you, so take care."
Aeris,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"...strange, hearing that from you."
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Well then, stay out of Shinra's way."
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,...Where's Aeris? She's not with you?
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Aeris isn't with us. She's with the others.
Tseng,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Oh... Then give her my regards.
Barret,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Wassup with that broad?
Aeris,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Who is that girl...?
Tifa,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Cloud, do you know her?"
Red XIII,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,...You don't see ones like that everyday...Who is that girl? She's still a child.
Cait Sith,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Who do you think it is? I didn't recognize the face.

Cait Sith,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Hey, you can't--! My gil, give it back--!"
Vincent,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,The Gil doesn't seem to be her real objective...

Yuffie,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Man...... I can't believe I lost...

Yuffie,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"No way I'm going to fight with punks like you more than once!I'll keep enough for the doctor bill! Next time, you won't be as lucky!"

Yuffie,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Thinkin' of running away? Stay and fight! FIGHT, I said!C'mon...... What's the matter?You're pretty scared of me, huh!?"
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- ......petrified.- You're gonna lose again.
Tifa,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- ......petrified.- You're outta your league!
Cid,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- Something like that- You're wasting your time
Yuffie,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Hmm, just as I thought. What do you expect with my skills?Good luck to you guys too. If you feel up to it, we can go another round. Later!I'm really gonna leave! REALLY!"
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- Go ahead...- Wait a second!

Cid,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"- GO, then!- ......Hold on!"
Yuffie,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Oh yeah? Then do whatever you want!
Barret,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Gone... Wassup with that?
Aeris,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,She's gone... So what was that all about?
Tifa,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,She's gone... What is it with her...?
Red XIII,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,Huh? She's gone...... What is she doing?
Cait Sith,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,...She disappeared... I don't have a clue what was going on.
Vincent,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,...... Difficult to understand her motivation.
Cid,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"She's gone, hey...... What's with that kid!?"
Yuffie,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"What is it, you still have somethin' for me?......Hmmm. So is that it?I know you want my help because I'm so good!You want me to go with you?"

Cid,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- ......That's right- What're you sayin'!
Yuffie,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,"Heh heh... thought so. You put me in a spot. Hmm, what should I do?But if you want me that bad, I can't refuse..."
Cloud,The Road to Junon - Yuffie,- ......What's your name?- ......Let's hurry on.

Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"We've been fighting the Shinra for a long time at this battlefield.Even now, we're still settled in for a long war with them.If you aren't in a hurry, would you help us fight them?Listen, we don't want to push you but, if you're in the middle of something, why don't you finish that first?"
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,- Where is Junon?- We'll help you
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Let's see...... Head north along the coast, and keep going for a ways and you'll run into Junon.You gotta be careful 'cause it sits in the shadows of a small hill."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Really!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details.
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,- Like to help but...- I guess we'll help you
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"- I'm sorry... really- All right, we'll help"
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,All right then...... Take care of yourselves...
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Really!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details.
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Do you guys want to see it, too?"
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,See what?
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,What?
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"The condors. They're huge. Come on, have a look."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"What do ya think? Awesome, huh?"
Materia Shopkeeper,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Hello. I'm sorry but we're not selling anything now.We're using everything we have for ourselves.
Item Shopkeeper,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Sorry, but I can't sell you anything now."
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Hmmn, now this is something, I never thought anyone would ever climb up here.......Your eyes are different. Well, anyhow. Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra."
Barret,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?
Aeris,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"What do you mean, ""a battlefield""?"
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,You mean Shinra?
Red XIII,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,The Shinra......
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,The Shinra? Here too?
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,......
Vincent,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,What do you mean by that?
Cid,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"A battlefield, we can't overlook that."
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"It appears you have a problem with Shinra, too. After all, you climbed up here.Why not listen to what I have to say for a moment?"
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,......- I guess so- Not interested
Barret,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,The hell you talkin' about!? They're all fightin' the Shinra too! You gonna ignore that!?
Aeris,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"After all, we came all this way, Cloud."
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Cloud, let's listen to what they have to say."
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Is this about the jewels?
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"I know, I know, Cloud. But let's listen for a bit."
Vincent,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,There's no harm in listening to them.
Cid,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Man, she sure's cold."
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Oh, by all means."
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Do you know what's at the top of this mountain?
Barret,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Huh? Something's up there?
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Come on, let's get it together."
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Look close, old man."
Aeris,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,A huge bird.
Red XIII,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,That's the reactor. And the condor.
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Yeah, come to think of it there was something."
Vincent,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Come to think of it, there was a reactor. But I've never seen anything shaped like it......"
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,The reactor and the condor.
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,That's the reactor and the condor.
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a condor.It seems the Shinra doesn't like the idea of having a condor on top of the reactor."
Barret,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Damn, that's one big bird! But why are they trying to get rid of it with weapons?"
Aeris,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Why?
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,What's so wrong with having a condor on top of the reactor?
Red XIII,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,It's not very logical.
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,I'm certain there must be state-of-the-art materia inside the reactor. Am I right?
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Huh?......
Vincent,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,......That's too much.
Cid,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Huh? I don't get it.
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"It seems there's some type of special materia in the reactor above us.And because the condors came, the Shinra rushed troops here.The military wants to get the condor and all the villagers off this mountain.The condors are now warming their eggs, which hatch only once every few years.We would like to protect the condors from being harmed."
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,New lives......
Barret,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,I'll do it! I'll protect them from Shinra!
Aeris,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"We must protect the condor eggs, right?"
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Condors' eggs. A real work of nature.We've got to protect the life of the planet.
Red XIII,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"So, to protect the eggs, are you gonna protect the reactor?......"
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Special materia, huh? Well, well, things are getting interesting."
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,I'm gonna leave it up to you all.
Vincent,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,......and come out in one piece?
Cid,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"You guys, what are ya gonna do?"
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra ourselves.That's why we have hired soldiers to help us.As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by fighting along side of us...What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?"
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,......
Barret,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,What's there to think about? We gotta do it!
Aeris,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Cloud, why are you still worrying about it?"
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Cloud......
Red XIII,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,You decide what we're going to do.
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"If things go right, we might even be able to pray to that special materia."
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,I'll leave it up to you so please do as you see fit.
Vincent,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,It's difficult to get back what you've lost......
Cid,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Don't be so wishy-washy. Hurry and make up your mind.
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,......- All right- Not interested
Barret,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Hey! We'll come to the rescue.
Aeris,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Yes, yes. Let's do our best."
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Cloud, thanks."
Red XIII,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"I got it. Let me lend a hand, too."
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Okay, it's settled. We're gonna get the materia, right?"
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Well then, let's do our best."
Vincent,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,That's the right decision.
Cid,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"If you've made up your mind, let's just do it."
Barret,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,What are you thinking!? And you call yourself a human!?
Aeris,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,What a jerk. I'm disappointed in you.
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Well......
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,We may have lost the materia.
Vincent,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Now don't regret what's already past.
Cid,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"If you've made up your mind, let's just do it."
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,I see...... Come back if you should change your mind.
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Have you by chance changed your mind?
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"......- Well, let's do it- My position hasn't changed"
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"(once Cloud agrees)Whew, we'll be saved.Ask my son, who's standing guard at the shed, about the details of our military tactics. We're depending on you."
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Everyone, listen to what I have to say.I can't possibly leave these people like this.Let's do whatever we can to help them. All right?"
Barret,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Hey! We'll come to the rescue.
Red XIII,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand, too."
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Okay, it's settled. We're gonna get the materia, right?"
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Well then, let's do our best."
Vincent,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,That's the right decision.
Cid,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"If you go that far, what can I say. Well, we'll be able to do something if you leave it up to us."
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Yes, yes, I've also told the store owners about you, so they should sell you various items.And feel free to use our beds.Ask my son, who's standing guard at the shed, about anything related to our military tactics."
Materia Shopkeeper,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Hello. Do your best. We will, too."
Item Shopkeeper,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,You hang in there!
Barret,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Ey, let's get some rest."
Aeris,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Let's rest. Okay?
Tifa,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Say, let's take a rest. Okay?"
Red XIII,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,We should get some rest while we can.
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Come on... break time, break time!"
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Now, shall we get some rest?"
Vincent,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,It's probably best to get some rest now.
Cid,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Come on; let's get some shut-eye.
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"So, will you help us? I don't want them to get killed.They're gigantic birds and so striking. We simply can't let them be killed by man's selfishness?Of course not. There's no way, especially at the hands of Shinra.If you're going to go look at them, get on top of that chair over there."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Thanks for accepting.Let me explain our strategy.The enemy will climb the mountain looking for the reactor. We will leave a trap for them and hire soldiers to protect the area.Well, that's all, but...... This village doesn't have any money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke.If we hired one soldier, we would need 400 gil. So, if we hire 20 soldiers, we must have 8000 gil.So if you folks have the time, we would like you to use your own money to hire these soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and command the troops.If you're pressed for time we'd like you to help us with the money.If you can give us the money, we can then hire soldiers with the funds and block Shinra's attack.We know that what we're asking is selfish.We have sent our wives and children to another village. We are resigned to our fate.Let's get back to square one. If the enemy penetrates our shed, you'll have to fight them immediately.Well, just because you lost once, it's not the end of the world, but if you lose repeatedly, it could be dangerous.Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?"
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"- Conditions for victory- The enemy- Soldiers, which can be hired- About funding- Other issues- Enough"
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"You can win by wiping out the enemy or killing the enemy commander in charge.If the enemy reaches the shed, they'll attack, and you'll have no choice but to go into battle immediately.In the event that you lose during direct contact, even if the enemy gets to the reactor, there's still a chance to save things.But it's only a slight chance, and we have no idea how much the reactor can endure in an attack.When we can't stand up to the attack any longer, the Shinra will take both the condors and our lives, as well as all the materia within the reactor."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,There are four types of enemies.- Wyverns- Beasts- Barbarians- Commanders- Anything else?
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Wyverns are flying types that can move at high speed. Stoner and Tristoner aren't effective against them.
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Beasts are monster types that do not move quickly, but have explosive attacking power."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Barbarians are human types. They attack indirectly, so you've got to be on your toes."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Commanders are the enemy commanders. They're the ones we want to subdue, but they're formidable foes."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Your mobile allies are: Fighters, Attackers, Defenders, Shooters, Repairers and Workers.Your immobile allies are: Stoner, Tristoner, Catapult, and Fire Catapult.Which do you want to hear about?"
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,- Mobile types- Immobile types- Anything else
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Which do you want to hear about?- Fighters- Attackers- Defenders- Shooters- Repairers- Workers- Anything else
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Fighters are good at defending and attacking, but aren't especially efficient or deficient for any enemy."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Attackers move extremely fast and are best for expanding the front line.They work good against enemy Beasts, but not enemy Barbarians."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Defenders have high endurance, but move slowly. They're best suited for defense.Defenders work best against enemy Barbarians, but not enemy Wyverns."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Shooters attack indirectly, but has low endurance. Shooters work best against enemy Wyverns, but not enemy Beasts."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Repairers repair allied aircraft, but have little attacking power."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Workers set torpedoes. Torpedoes have strong attacking power, but Workers don't.Torpedoes explode when touched by the enemy. The explosions will damage everything in the immediate area."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Which do you want to hear about?- Stoners- Tristoners- Catapults- Fire Catapult- Anything else
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Stoners can fire a single boulder, causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Tristoners can fire three boulders simultaneously, causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits.We can't use the Tristoner or Fire Catapult, because they are still being developed."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Catapults shoot rocks a great distance. causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits.
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Fire Catapults fire bombs a great distance. causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits.We can't use the Tristoner or Fire Catapult, because they are still being developed."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,We have 12000 gil right now.We need 3000 gil for each battle.How much can you help?
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,- 500 gil- 1000 gil- 2000 gil- 3000 gil- 5000 gil- We can't help right now
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,(if Cloud gives any amount of money)Thanks. This makes [TOTAL] gil.
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"First off, we must prepare the troops.Move the cursor wherever the x mark does not appear, then press the O button to set-up.After all positions are in place, select by pressing the X button. This starts the battle.Soldiers can only be arranged near the shed, in the beginning.That's because if the soldiers are too far away, they won't be able to follow instructions.You can only put soldiers on the horizontal line at the very bottom.Soldiers can be instructed by pushing the select button. So if any commands are unclear, push it.Soldiers can report by pushing the O button......The cursor will move to the soldier who made the report.Press the X button and you'll hear the report without moving.And you can bet Shinra will send platoons at you on a regular basis.It would be great if you could spare the time to help us...But if you really don't have time, would you contribute some financial assistance."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Hey, this one climbing up here looks like they'd be just right. Please, any help is appreciated...Preparations ready?"
Cloud,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"- Wait- Okay, ready- Contribute gil- Let them handle it- Hear more"
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"I see, very well then. Maybe, we'll fight together again sometime."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"You have 10 enemies. There appear to be many Beasts, so you may want to deploy more Attackers."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Whew, that was good. But Shinra's troops will be back.Be sure and scout the area well... we don't know when they'll attack again.We have X allies left, so here's X gil.Oh, yeah. I found this just now on the battlefield. Maybe it'll come in handy for you guys."
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,My God! They're attacking! We're counting on you.
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,We made it through that one somehow. But Shinra'll be back.Be sure and scout the area well... we don't know when they'll attack again.
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Are you all right? Looks like a few got through.
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,How are things going? Seems like there's no activity at Shinra.
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,Perfect timing! They're just around the corner. Get ready.
Man,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,How goes it? The Shinra troops have attacked X times since you were here.So we're getting a litttle short on funds.We have X gil right now.
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra,"Oh, it's you guys? How are things going?"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,What happened to this town? It's so run-down...
Woman,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Wow, now this is rare. We almost never have anyone other than the Shinra people visit this town.I know you guys want to go to the Western Continent, but the only way is on a Shinra ship."
Weapons Shopkeeper,Junon - The New President Rufus,"If you see a weapon you want, you'd better buy it."
Fisherman,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Ever since... Shinra built that city up above during the war, ...ugh, ugh.There's been no fish in the water! It got so polluted... phew..."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,What kinda place is this?
Older Man,Junon - The New President Rufus,Who are you people? Where did you come from?
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Did you see a man with a black cape?
Older Man,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hmm... I've never seen that feller before.There's nothing here now... But it used to be a busy port.
Elevator Guard,Junon - The New President Rufus,"HEY! This is Shinra, Inc.'s elevator. Don't be snooping around here!!"
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,He-y! Mr. Dolphin!My name is......Pri-scil-la!Now you say it.
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,No! You got it all wrong! We're fighting against the Shinra!
Aeris,Junon - The New President Rufus,No you're wrong! We have nothing to do with the Shinra.
Tifa,Junon - The New President Rufus,No... stay calm...
Red XIII,Junon - The New President Rufus,...we don't get along well with the Shinra.
Yuffie,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey watch your mouth! We hate the Shinra!
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,...that's how it is.
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,I don't believe you! Get out of here!
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Great...
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey! Look at that!
Aeris,Junon - The New President Rufus,What's that!?
Tifa,Junon - The New President Rufus,Look at that!
Red XIII,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey! It's a monster!
Yuffie,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Whoa, Gawd!"
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,Be careful Mr. Dolphin!
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Hey! Hold on, we're coming!"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"This is bad... You don't think she's dead, do you?"
Older Man,Junon - The New President Rufus,Priscilla!!
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Mouth to mouth!?
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,C'mon Cloud.
Aeris,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Cloud, hurry!"
Yuffie,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Do it, Cloud!"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"But, ... she's just a girl......"
Tifa,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Cloud, what are you going to do?"
Red XIII,Junon - The New President Rufus,You know I can't.
Older Man,Junon - The New President Rufus,"What? You don't know how? Come over here, I'll show you."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Guess I gotta do it...
Older Man,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Just take a deep breath, hold it in. Then breathe into her.Hurry up and do it!"
Older Man,Junon - The New President Rufus,What are you doing!? Hurry up! Breath deeply and give her mouth to mouth!
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,Uh... ugh...
Older Man,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Hey hey! Priscilla, are you alright?"
Older Man,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Sorry, Cloud. Priscilla needs to rest for a while."
Woman,Junon - The New President Rufus,"(waiting outside her house)Hey, come in for a while."
Woman,Junon - The New President Rufus,"I heard what happened. You've done so much for Priscilla.You all must be tired. If you want to get some rest, stay here.Make yourselves at home."
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,I'm gonna relax for a while.
Aeris,Junon - The New President Rufus,Want to rest?
Tifa,Junon - The New President Rufus,Take a rest?
Red XIII,Junon - The New President Rufus,Shall we rest?
Yuffie,Junon - The New President Rufus,Wanna rest?
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Yeah...- We'll try later- Let's rest
Tifa,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Hey wake up. Wake up, Cloud!"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Tifa...When Sephiroth and I went to Nibelheim, where were you?"
Tifa,Junon - The New President Rufus,"...We saw each other, right?"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,The other time.
Tifa,Junon - The New President Rufus,"No... it was 5 years ago. I don't remember.But, something seems strange outside. Cloud, come quick."
Woman,Junon - The New President Rufus,"For the past few decades, the only thing I've been hearing about is the Shinra.I miss the times when we used to talk only about fish..."
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,Seems like something's goin' on up there!
Aeris,Junon - The New President Rufus,I heard that girl regained consciousness.
Tifa,Junon - The New President Rufus,Doesn't it seem a little strange? Everything getting so noisy all of a sudden...?
Red XIII,Junon - The New President Rufus,Does this have something to do with the Shinra?
Yuffie,Junon - The New President Rufus,What's this loud music? It's giving me a headache!
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Are you all right now?
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Umm... thanks for helping...I'm sorry, I mistook you for one of those Shinra, Inc. ..."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,That's all right.
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,"I'll give you something SPECIAL!It's an amulet. Take good care of it, ok?"
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,What's that music? It sure sounds lively.
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,I heard they're rehearsing the reception for the new Shinra president.
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,Rufus!? I gotta pay my respects.
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Grandpa and grandma told me this beach was beautiful when they were small.But after the Shinra built that city above, the sun stopped shining here, and the water got polluted...I was raised on that story and hate Shinra so much, I could die!"
Aeris,Junon - The New President Rufus,"You think Rufus is thinking about crossing the ocean from here, too?What? Does that mean Sephiroth already crossed the ocean?"
Red XIII,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Cloud, didn't you finish Rufus off?"
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,We gotta get to the town up there... Mebbe we could climb the tower?
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,"No! No! There's a high voltage current running underneath the tower. Don't wander near it, it's dangerous!But... you might be able to if Mr. Dolphin helps you. Follow me!"
Tifa,Junon - The New President Rufus,High voltage tower......I guess this means Cloud'll be all right.
Aeris,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Yeah, better leave it to Cloud!"
Red XIII,Junon - The New President Rufus,"We're counting on you, Cloud"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey!!Wait a second!
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Yeah, I'd like to take a good look at the new President of Shinra, Inc.!"
Tifa,Junon - The New President Rufus,Don't you just hate this?
Aeris,Junon - The New President Rufus,You're probably right.
Red XIII,Junon - The New President Rufus,That looks like a Shinra soldier.
Yuffie,Junon - The New President Rufus,Aren't you going to follow her?
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,Wait a minute.
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,Now ain't that something! I ain't never seen no Dolphin jump like that!
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Pretty cool, huh? When I blow this whistle, Mr. Dolphin jumps for me.Here!! This is for you, Cloud!"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,A gift? What am I supposed to do with it!?
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Just go into the water, blow this whistle, and Mr. Dolphin'll jump you to the top of the pole!"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Jump to the top of the pole?
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,"See that rod sticking out at the top? If you jump just right, you can climb to the top of the town."
Barret,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Good luck Cloud! If you make it, we'll follow you!Whoa, I'll hold the PHS for you. It'll break if it gets wet."
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,You wanna jump with Mr. Dolphin?
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,- Explain it to me again- Sure- I'll pass
Priscilla,Junon - The New President Rufus,Come back whenever you want to see Mr. Dolphin!
Soldiers,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Eh! Ho!Hurry! Hurry!!The new President!! He's here, he's here!!"
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey! You still dressed like that!? Come 'ere!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey! Rookie!! Can't you hear me!! Come over here!

Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,It's the Shinra uniform.- Don't change- Change
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Quit yappin'! Hurry up!
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,A Shinra uniform...I was so proud when I first put it on.I wonder when it was......I couldn't stand wearing this thing anymore.
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Wow! You look good in it!You remember the Greeting procedure, right!?"
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"...the look on your face says you forgot. All right, I'll show you again!Do just like we do."
Soldiers,Junon - The New President Rufus,Commander!! We'll help too!This is how to do it!We'll sing too!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"All right! Show 'em!!Now, march!! This's the Welcoming March!"
Soldier,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Then! I'll sing along with you!Quietly--!!Aaaaah!Aaaaah!Hey, come on now."
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Now!And... march--!!One, two...! Three, four!Keep in step with the soldier next to you and march smoothly!"
Soldiers,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Rufus--- Rufus Shinra----We---are---Shinra Company---- The new-----President------Oh----- Oh----- Shinra---------Oh----- Oh oh---- Shinra, Inc.---Realization----of the new era--- New---President----Ru--fus---Oh----- Oh----- Shinra---------Oh----- Oh oh---- Shinra, Inc.---Building------the new era----- Shinra-----forev---er-------"
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Once you're all in step, shoulder your gun!To shoulder your gun, press the O button!Got it!?"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,- Not yet- All clear!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,All right! Once more!We'll practice some more!Remember to march smoothly!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Good! Make sure you do well at the real parade!
Soldier,Junon - The New President Rufus,Rufus has arrived! Preparation completed!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"All right, show time! Don't disgrace yourselves!"
Soldier,Junon - The New President Rufus,Begin the Welcome Parade!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Oh... no...!! No one's here!Late---!?Hey Rookie!! It's because you're running around like that!!
Soldier,Junon - The New President Rufus,Captain!! We'll take a short cut!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Right!Good idea.Get over here!!All right! You first!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey!! Don't get me any madder than I already am!
Soldier,Junon - The New President Rufus,"I'll go first! Now you watch close and do as I do, rookie!Just sneak into the back of the line when you see an opening."
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Now listen up! This parade's gonna be broadcast live on Shinra TV, around the world!If you look bad, the whole Junon army will look bad. Remember that and don't screw up!OK! Jump in when I give you the sign!Just sneak in from the back! Don't mess up the row!And no matter what you do don't try to go in from the front!All right!!

Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Just GO! Then you just nonchalantly sneak in from the back! Make sure no one sees you!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"No, what're you doing!?"
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey!! Don't run away from me!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey!! Don't play around!
TV Producer,Junon - The New President Rufus,What the hell was that soldier doing?
AD,Junon - The New President Rufus,I don't know.
TV Producer,Junon - The New President Rufus,Are the points up?
AD,Junon - The New President Rufus,This's terrible! Am... am I fired?
TV Producer,Junon - The New President Rufus,What!? You're FIRED!!Send that soldier a bomb or something!
AD,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Well, it's so-so."
TV Producer,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hmm...Better send that soldier something.
AD,Junon - The New President Rufus,So-so.
TV Producer,Junon - The New President Rufus,Really.I want somebody to send that soldier an expensive gift.
AD,Junon - The New President Rufus,They just shot up!!
TV Producer,Junon - The New President Rufus,We did it!Send that soldier something special.
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Good! We made it.Oh! President Rufus!Hey! Line up and shut up!Don't make a move!
Rufus,Junon - The New President Rufus,How's the job?What happened to the Airship?
Heidegger,Junon - The New President Rufus,The long range airship is still being prepared.It should be ready in about three more days. Gya haa haa!
Rufus,Junon - The New President Rufus,Even the Air Force's Gelnika?
Heidegger,Junon - The New President Rufus,......Gya haa haa!
Rufus,Junon - The New President Rufus,Stop that stupid horse laugh.Things are different than when father was in charge.
Heidegger,Junon - The New President Rufus,Gya...
Rufus,Junon - The New President Rufus,Is the ship ready?
Heidegger,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Yes Sir, we'll get it ready quickly."
Soldiers,Junon - The New President Rufus,"What a disaster.Heidegger was really irritated...The man in the Black Cape's been roaming the city, but we can't find him."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Man in a Black Cape?
Soldiers,Junon - The New President Rufus,"He showed up two or three days ago, and killed a few of our soldiers.He disappeared right after that. There's a rumor going around that it was Sephiroth."
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Attention! Dismissed!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey! Hey you! You messing with the army?
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,- Who cares?- What if I am?
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,(he says the same thing regardless)You're too lazy!! No break for you!!Get over here!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"This is the military, soldier!! Your orders for today are to send off President Rufus at the dock!I'll keep drilling you until it's time!"
Soldiers,Junon - The New President Rufus,"I'll help, sir!Me too, sir!"
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"All right!! Line up in order and show me your final pose!Today's command is Formation!Remember it!Ready!?Junon Military Send Off, BEGIN!!"
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,All right! Now you try it!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"So, you got it?"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,- Not yet!- I've got it!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,All right! Don't mess up during the real thing!
Soldier,Junon - The New President Rufus,Commander!! What's today's special pose?
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Huh? ...I haven't decided yet.All right, rookie!! I'll let you decide!Show me your best move!"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Let's see... My best move is...
Soldiers,Junon - The New President Rufus,Woo----ow!That's awesome!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,All right!! We'll go with that as today's special!!Practice it!
Soldiers,Junon - The New President Rufus,Yes sir!!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Well then! Meet at the dock!! Don't be late!!Attention! Dismissed!!
Elevator Guard,Junon - The New President Rufus,"What? It's not time for our shift, yet. Just relax."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,Uh... yea......
Materia Shopkeeper,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Come on, forget about your job! Step right up!!"
Materia Shopkeeper,Junon - The New President Rufus,Welcome!I was just starting to get worried... You see our sales were pretty bad today.
Weapons Shopkeeper,Junon - The New President Rufus,I've got nothing to sell to you! Come back later!
Barkeeper,Junon - The New President Rufus,I'm sorry! It's all rented out today!
Rude,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Mm...? You too?Then, take your mask off and come here. That's our rule."
Man with Head on Table,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Looks like something's going on outside, but we're too smashed to do anything...Ooh, oohh... Oh man, my head's burning up..."
Bald Man in Suspenders,Junon - The New President Rufus,Seems like you're all a little too young to be in here.
Big Bald Man,Junon - The New President Rufus,Seaweed... Seaweed...
Item Shopkeeper,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Oh, a Soldier! Welcome!"
Man in Plainclothes,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Hey, how could you do that!? Nobody woke me up!And I can't find the uniform I left in my locker, either. I wonder if I left it somewhere...Geez! Do you think this could be... what they call 'bullying?'Oh man, My future in the military, is pretty bleak."
Soldier,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Hmm? A know-it-all, huh?All right!! Come in!!"
Soldier,Junon - The New President Rufus,This is a Respectable Inn... guests only!You should absorb all the wisdom until it is a part of you.
Soldier 2,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Ok wise-guy, I'll ask about Materia just so you can let off some stress."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,You're right...- Growth Materia- Kinds of Materia- Combinations of Materia- Divisions of Materia- Numbers of Materia that you may carry- The rest is a secret
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"First off, the main points.Some types of Materia, like Magic, grow as you use them.Some, like Summon Magic, grow from being used once a battle, to several times per battle.Their effectiveness changes too. ...There are all different kinds.Some types don't change, but they must grow in order to be divided....And that's it. Maybe that sounded too official."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Types of Materia... Here goes...![Independent Materia] enables Abilities. No linking required.[Support Materia] is used with Command, Magic, and Summon Materia.You must equip them in linked slots or they won't be any good.[Command Materia] lets you use new commands.There are lots of different kinds of Materia, so you'll never get bored. One called [Attack] changes itself.[Magic Materia] is easy. You can use Magic, and as your Level increases, you'll learn new Magic.[Summon Materia] let's you use Summon Magic. As your Level increases, the number of times you can use it in a single battle increases.This's one of my favorites.And there you have it, the five types of Materia."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"There's no single way to combine Materia. So here goes the basics.Support Materia... The basic combination is Magic + All.The variety of magic you can cast will increase as your Magic Level increases.When your All level increases, so does the number of times you can use it in a battle. That about covers it.Huh? Wait a sec...You can change between Magic-All and Magic with the L1/R1 buttons. I'll bet you've probably already done this.One effective combination is Elemental + Summon Materia.If you equip this combination to your weapon, you can put Magic and Summon Elementals on your weapon.For example, if you equip Fire + Elemental to your sword, you will end up with Fire Elemental Sword.I'm getting off the subject,... If you equip Fire + Elemental to your armor, it will have twice the resistance to fire damage.Now this is important. When the Elemental levels in your armor increase, so will their effectiveness. From half damage - no damage - absorb.If you combined Elemental and Fire you could develop Fire absorbing armor.Wait, there's more. Next is the Added Effect for Support Materia.The Added Effect Materia grafts the effects of Compound Status Materia into your weapons and armor.For example, equip Added Effect + Poison to your weapon and select [Attack].Sometimes you'll give a Poison status. Of course, it doesn't always work.If you don't combine the Added Effect Materia with Status Change Materia, like Confusion or Time, you won't get any effect.To learn more about Added Effect, access the menu and check the Status.It's a little hard to get, but if you take your time, you'll be all right."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Division... I'm pretty good at this.People tell me that my personality is divided. But I don't think so, but maybe it is...Anyhow...Once your Materia reaches the maximum Level, it will divide.The original Materia will no longer grow. Once that happens, all you can do is use it as it is.New Materia always starts out with zero AP, so you need to raise its levels!Of course, once the new Materia reaches its max, it'll divide. That's how you increase your Materia collection.Ha, ha...... Right now I feel like I'm dividing myself."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Once Materia starts dividing, you must be careful.There's a limit to how much Materia you can have.Since we're fighting for the life of the Planet, it goes against my beliefs carrying too much Materia.Either way, I don't really care, but... I'll leave it up to you.That's why, the amount of Materia that we can have is limited to 200... only what we can equip.When you have too much Materia, you need to dispose of some. If you don't, you can't take on any more.So, ditch some Materia before that happens... Ahem... I mean, give them back to the Planet."
Soldier 3,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Ok. Expert! Enlighten us on Limit Techniques, why doncha?"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,I don't have too much to say about that...- Developing Limits- Extreme Limits- That's it
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"There are 2 basic ways of building up your Limit techniques. First, just use them!And second is to finish off as many enemies as possible! It sounds easier than it is.Everyone knows that when you gain a new Limit technique, you need to select it in the menu.And you knew that you won't be able to use advanced techniques on each level if you haven't used the basic ones.Since the type and growth for each limit techniques is different, that's about all I will say."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"A long time ago I heard extreme techniques exist within the Limit techniques.But, if that's true you wouldn't be able to get it in any normal way. That's about all I know about it."
Ghost,Junon - The New President Rufus,"This is the Beginner's Hall (Intermediate)!Your explanations were so complicated I couldn't return to the Planet.So, I have a right to ask you again."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,What do you want to know?- How to save?- How do I cure party members?- Curative Magic- Weapons and armor- How to apply Materia- Effective ways to use Materia- Battle formation- Checking status- Limit Techniques- Other- You got nothing to teach me!
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"For my explanation, I'll need a Potion."
Ghost,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Man, ex-SOLDIER's sure are cheap. OK, I'll GIVE you a Potion..."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"For my explanation, I'll need a Potion."
Ghost,Junon - The New President Rufus,I don't seem to have any on me. Why don't you go buy one?
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"I think you know the basics, but just in case...Do not open the PlayStation or change discs until instructed.If you open the Disc Cover, I can't guarantee anything. That is all."
Ghosts 2 & 3,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Ok, Mr. Know-it-all, ex-SOLDIER! Let me revenge... I mean, review!"
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,What do you want to review?- ATB- Onscreen numbers- Change and Defend- Escape- Gauges- Status- Elementals- Help- That's all
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"ATB means Active Time Battle. It's a system in which time continuously runs during battle.If the ATB is changed to [WAIT] in the Config Menu... Time stops during battle while you select magic or an item.That lets you select your commands carefully. It's geared especially for beginners like you.In config, if you change from ATB to [Recommended]... Time will stop while magic or item effects are displayed.This lets you watch the effects carefully. Letting you fight at your own pace... this is the way to go.I always use ACTIVE mode, but choose what you want. That's all."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"During a battle, white numbers that appear on the screen indicate damage, and green numbers indicate recovery points.Remember that, if you don't want to be wiped out."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Change will change your fighting position to either the front or back row.If you select the back row, the amount of damage you receive is reduced, but so is your attacking power.[Change] can be selected from the battle menu by pushing the [left Directional button].You can also select [Defend] from battle menu by pushing the Directional button to the right.Defend will reduce your damage by half until your next turn.It's better to use Defend for strong enemies. Of course, I don't need anything like that."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"I don't know too much about Escape during battles since I never do it, but... someone like you might need it.You can escape by holding down the L1 and R1 buttons during battle."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"It might be hard to understand this next one since you can't check it right now, but just listen.I'm talking about the Gauges displayed during battle.Time Gauge shows the time remaining until your next turn during battle.You can enter a command once the Gauge is full, but if you don't want to enter a command, press the △ button to skip to the next person.This is good when you want to make Barret work.The Limit Gauge increases as you receive damage. When this is full, you are able to use a Limit Technique.The Limit Gauge doesn't reset after each battle, so it will build up the more damage you get in battle.The trick is knowing when to use it instead of using it as soon as it becomes available.You may already know this, but I'll tell you anyways. Status has two conditions: Fury and Sadness.Fury speeds up your Limit Gauge, but decreases your concentration.Sadness slows down your Limit Gauge, but also decreases the damage you receive. Keep this in mind.Barrier Gauge shows the time available for special magic effects.The top gauge Barrier, defends against attacks. And the bottom gauge Magic Barrier, defends against magic spells.Both reduce the amount of damage by half, but disappear after several uses.Always keep an eye on the Barrier Gauge, when using Barrier and Magic Barrier spells.That's all. Check them out next time you're in a battle."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Status simply means the status of the characters.I don't want to repeat myself too much, so I'll mention the main points.SleepCannot enter command until awakened.PoisonRapidly decreases HP during battle.FuryDoubles damage, reduces concentration. Tranquilizer cures it.SadnessDamage reduced. Hyper cures it.PetrifyTurns you into stone. If entire party is petrified, You'll get Wiped Out.ConfusionYou cannot distinguish between enemy and ally.SilenceYou cannot cast any Magic.ParalysisTime Gauge stops, you cannot enter commands.DarknessReduces attack concentration.FrogTurns you into a frog. I hate this.Phew...I'm tired.Changed Status can be changed with magic and items, so always double check it when you buy things."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Elementals are special Elementals that come with magic and weapons.You have to use this to your advantage in battle.Only once you start thinking in terms of Elementals can you truly be called an intermediate player.Here are some examples. Remember, they're just examples. You don't have to memorize them.FireFire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters.IceIce effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold.LightningLightning effect. Works best on mechanical things.EarthAttacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies.PoisonPoisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison based enemies.GravityGravity based attack. These hurt if they hit.WaterCalls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters.WindCalls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies.HolyCalls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters.Using opposite Elementals often is effective in battle.Using the same Elementals usually increases Defense.But, the reverse is also true. Watch out for it.To find out what Elementals an enemy has, you need Sense Materia. Once you get it, try it out."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,"If you don't understand what I just told you, I guess you just have a limited capacity for information.But, relax. Push the [SELECT] Button during battle.A Help Message should explain the different commands to you.It'll tell you things like the monsters' names, even I look at it, sometimes... So don't be ashamed to use it."
Soldier Studying,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Mmm? I'm not going to the parade.The road to becoming SOLDIER First Class is very difficult.Don't mind me.As a man with promise and future, I don't have any time to fool around like the rest of you."
Soldier Guarding Upper Junon Lift,Junon - The New President Rufus,President Rufus is being sent off at the port.
Sailor Outside Underwater Reactor,Junon - The New President Rufus,"What is it? The elevator's out of order right now due to an inspection.You know, right under us, is a Submarine Dock and the Underwater Mako Reactor.Mako energy puts a lot of wear and tear on the machinery.A lot of problems can pop up. So it's necessary for close inspections and maintenance."
Soldier Guarding Lower Junon Lift,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Oh! How's it going!? If you're looking for Junon dock, it's over there!This lift goes to the Shinra section...Ever since that Black-caped murderer... But we can't use it because we're all on red alert."
Barkeeper,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Hey soldier-boy, aren't you still on duty?"
Tseng,Junon - The New President Rufus,Stay outta this.
Reno,Junon - The New President Rufus,The President's safety is secure because we're here.
Elena,Junon - The New President Rufus,"The minute you think the job's boring, you guys start messing around."

Redhead,Junon - The New President Rufus,I won't charge you for a smile...
Black-haired girl,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Buy a lot, cutie!"
Girl,Junon - The New President Rufus,Please go to the counter.
Materia Shopkeeper,Junon - The New President Rufus,"There's lots of stores in Junon.If we don't do this... we can't compete.But, what bothers me is that the girls make more than me."
Girls,Junon - The New President Rufus,Thank you very much!
Accessory Shopkeeper,Junon - The New President Rufus,"I used to be in SOLDIER... Once I left, I opened up this shop...But to tell you the truth, I'd rather be at the shop downstairs."
Soldier,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Hey! Aren't you still on duty!?Look, I'm in no position to talk, but...Don't become a delinquent worker like me."
Shinra Manager,Junon - The New President Rufus,It's so shameful!...and they told me that I would be staying at five star hotels on these trips...How can you guys sleep in a place like this?
Weapons Shopkeeper,Junon - The New President Rufus,Oh! Welcome!We don't have anything special now. I kind of messed up the last time I ordered but feel free to look around!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,"All right, it's time!Ten... HUT!"

Rufus,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Once the word gets out that Sephiroth's here, Cloud and his friends will show up, too."
Heidegger,Junon - The New President Rufus,We'll crush them as soon as we find them!
Rufus,Junon - The New President Rufus,We can't have them get in our way.
Heidegger,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Leave it up to me, sir! Gya haa ha!"
Rufus,Junon - The New President Rufus,I thought I told you to stop that stupid laugh...
Heidegger,Junon - The New President Rufus,Gya......
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,All right! Dismissed!
Soldiers,Junon - The New President Rufus,"That was close.Heidegger's been really edgy lately.Because Hojo disappeared, leaving a letter of resignation.Heidegger's been forced to take care of that investigation, too."
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,Hey--! I thought you were dismissed!
Commander,Junon - The New President Rufus,We got some cleaning up to do! Hurry up!
Red XIII,Junon - The New President Rufus,"Hey, hurry. You're the last one."
Cloud,Junon - The New President Rufus,How did you get here?
Red XIII,Junon - The New President Rufus,"A dolphin gave me a ride.Priscilla remembered the dolphin after you climbed the pole. But, you mustn't be mad at her."
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"We'll cross the ocean, to the new continent....even if we are wearing Shinra's uniforms..."
Sailor,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?The new President's probably the same.He's just gonna order us around anyway."
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Urrrgh... This is why... I hate ships.Hey, Cloud. You have any 'Tranquilizers'?"
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"- Here, use this- Nope"
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Thanks... Gross... this is bitter.
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,...unless it's an emergency get away from me.
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Where are the others?I dunno. Aren't they hiding somewhere around here?How should I know...? Ugh...... urk......
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Umm...... It's me .Hey, Cloud. Did you see the Airship at Junon?"
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"...I heard it was big, but I didn't expect it to be THAT big."
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"That was REALLY something.Hey, do you think I could get on it?"
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,- I'll take you someday- I dunno...
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Wow! I'm really looking forward to it!Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me!"
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"...Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it.Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship."
Sailor 2,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,It won't do any good trying to stop me!All right! I'm going to show the new President what I'm made of!
Soldier,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Hey, get to work!Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship!If we do good, we could get promoted!"
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Yes sir! Everything quiet, sir!...But, you know what? I really hate this uniform.Uniforms, soldiers, war, I hate 'em all.They take away all the things and people you love...I wish they'd all disappear. Right, Cloud?"
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,- Yeah......- I don't know
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"You're right!Uh, yes sir, I'll continue my watch sir! Hee hee..."
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,...Cloud. Wearing those clothes seems to have changed you a little.Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not...
Sailor 3,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"President Rufus and his men are in the Bridge of the Ship. If they see you slacking, they'll bust you one!"
Sailor 4,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Hey! What's wrong, kid? You got no pep!A seaman's gotta have umph!"
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,- I'm tired...- Something's missing- Leave me alone
Sailor 4,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,I got just the perfect thing! 'Invisible Alpha'-- A super drink for seamen!!Just one'll rejuvenate you! Only 250 gil!
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,- I'll take it- No thanks
Sailor 4,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Thanks! This is a necessity for a sailor.This is a must item for a sailor! Ha ha ha!
Sailor 4,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Hey! You don't have enough money!
Sailor 4,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Hey! Seamen shouldn't be so stingy!
Sailor 4,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Ey ey! Whattaya mean, 'missin'!?"
Soldier 2,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol.When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan..."
Red XIII,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"............It's me..I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught.Humans only look at appearances anyway.Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being."
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Hey, Cloud. Did you see Barret?I hope he's not doing anything stupid..."
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Look, Cloud. It's Rufus and Heidegger.They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em...Ummmm...... Gmmmmm......How can he...... Goin' off laughin' like that?Because of him, Biggs...... Wedge...... Jessie......!Ggggggggh... Ggggh......! Ggggggghhh!!God!! I can't take it anymore!I'm gonna settle things here and now......"
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Damn, did they find us!?Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean... Tifa and the others!?Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud!"
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Everyone all right!?
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,You all right!?
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Huh?
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Everyone's here... right?
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Hey, wait.You don't think that suspicious character is..."
Someone,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Sephiroth!?
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Really!?
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,How the hell am I supposed to know!?
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,...Let's find out.
Red XIII,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"It's the most logical thing to do. Then, who's going to go?"
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"(backing away)N, not me...I don't even like Sephiroth anyway. And besid...... ugh...... urk......"
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"...... Sephiroth............All right, let's go!"
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,I'm goin' too!
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Is it really Sephiroth......?
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Take me with you!
Red XIII,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,These clothes are too tight on me. Can I switch with you?
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"I told you... I don't want... to, ugh...... urk......"
Sailor 4,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Say, who are you? You're not a part of the crew.Oh well, seamen never bother with details!How you feelin'!"
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,- I'm tired...- Something's missing- Leave me alone
Soldier,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,...the Engine Room... ...a suspicious...... character...No...... there's no way...... that...... not a human...... That thing's not human...............
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Is it...... Sephiroth?
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,No... not Sephiroth!
Sephiroth,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,......After a long sleep......the time.........time has...... come...
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Look, Cloud!!"
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Look, Cloud!!"
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Cloud, look!!"
Red XIII,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Over there, Cloud."
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Ov...... over there!!
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Sephiroth! You're alive!
Sephiroth,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,......Who are you?
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,You don't remember me!? I'm !
Sephiroth,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Cloud...
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Sephiroth! What are you thinking!? What are you doing!?
Sephiroth,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,...the time...... is now...
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,What!? What are you saying!? Be more......
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Isn't he...... that guy?
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,I've seen this before...
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,I've seen this somewhere... before.
Red XIII,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,That's what disappeared from the Shinra building...
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Eeeew! What IS it! GROSS!
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,...Jenova. The arm of Jenova.
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Jenova...You mean he's been walkin' around with that thing?
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Jenova... With this thing?
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Jenova... He's been carrying this thing around?
Red XIII,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Sephiroth took Jenova... What does it mean?
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Gag... I'm feeling sick as it is without you having to show me THIS...
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,So it WAS Sephiroth.
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,He said the time is now.
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,The time is now... I think that was what was said.
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,He said something about it being time for something.
Red XIII,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,The time is now...? What does that mean?
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,He was mumbling something about time!
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,......Time... is now?
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"I don't know WHAT the hell's goin' on!Cloud, why don't you explain to me what's happened so far?"
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Hmm... I don't get it.Hey, Cloud. Can you explain it to us?"
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"I'm getting so confused...Cloud, explain what's happened so far."
Red XIII,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"Hmm... The story's not that simple.Cloud, why don't you summarize what's happened so far?"
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,So what's the story?Hey Cloud. Give us a quick run down.
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"- I'll try- Too much trouble [With this choice, he doesn't say anything more.]"
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,"...I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining.Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could become the ruler of the planet... That was 5 years ago.Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra.And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth.He was carrying Jenova with him....This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the Promised Land with his mother, Jenova....I guess that's about it."
Barret,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Whoa! We'd best hurry and hide somewhere.
Aeris,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Maybe we shouldn't stay in here anymore...
Tifa,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,We should hide somewhere again.
Red XIII,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,I don't think it's wise to stay here any longer.
Yuffie,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Phew... We're finally here... Now we gotta hide......
Cloud,Cargo Ship - Ocean Crossing,Sephiroth... is alive...The Promised Land... Does it really exist...?
Barret,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Damn! Sure is hot here!But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this sailor suit.Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Oh, too bad. I liked Barret's sailor suit.He looked so cute."
Barret,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"......What'ya mean ""cute""?"
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Right... well, uh...Barret, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?Right, Cloud?"
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,- I guess- Keep your mind on Sephiroth
Barret,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be the most comfortable, so shu'up!"
Barret,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Hmmph, Cloud. You're the one, who's always hangin' around wastin' time. I'm going to skip this resort!"
Red XIII,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,...puff... puff...Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose.
Yuffie,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yeah, mine, too!!"
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,All right. We'll take a break and then head off.Don't wander too far off.
Barret,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I'll wander wherever I damn well want! Who made him the leader?
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Maybe I should get a tan for a change.Which do you like, Cloud?"
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,- I like fair complexions.- Maybe a healthy tan is nice.
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,(she says the same thing regardless)Got it. I'll remember that.
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I think I'll go swimming.
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Sounds good to me!Hmm? Cloud, are you thinking of anything in particular?Your cool exterior's cracking...Well then, let's go!"
Red XIII,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,It looks like my mane got messed up.I'm going to rest somewhere cool.
Yuffie,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Don't bother looking for me!
Sailor,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"You're stowaways, right?It's okay. I'm used to them.The truth is, before I worked here, I was one of the best.Costa del Sol... a harbor paradise where the sun always shines and it's summer all year round!Hmm...... Things aren't going well...... You can go sightseeing in the city."
Sailor Running Around,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Don't bug me. This is Rufus's first official visit since becoming President.It seems like he's here on business this time.I'm so jealous of him, I could spit. We're both about the same age, but, he's President."
Sailor on the Helipad,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Oh crap... The manager of Shinra won't come down.Even though the President's here on business. All he does is play, forgetting everything to do with work."
Woman Lounging on Sea Plane,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"But a bunch of hardworking deckhands like you wouldn't understand.On the marine blue sea, Gazing at the eternal skies that seem to go on forever... Gives you the feeling like you're taking a nap on the wing of a Cessna.It's the ultimate high!"
Man Near Sea Plane,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Heh, heh... I hear the Shinra brass are arriving soon.Heh, heh...! Got nothing to do with us, does it?"
Rufus,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,What a long boat ride that was!!Hmmm...... Good work everyone......
Heidegger,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Gya, Heh, heh..., ha!! Hurry up with that!"
Sailor,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yes, sir!!"
Rufus,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I heard Sephiroth was on board.
Heidegger,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,......Yes.
Rufus,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"And it seems Cloud and the others were on board, too."
Heidegger,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,......Yes.
Rufus,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"They all slipped through...... You messed up big this time, Heidegger."
Heidegger,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I'm ashamed of myself.
Rufus,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Is that all you can do...?Give one word answers and apologize for everything?
Sailor,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Ready for departure, sir!!"
Rufus,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,......Do something. I'll be expecting results.
Man Near Sea Plane,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Hey! Spread out, all of you, out!!Put any fingerprints, scratches, or dents on that plane and I'll put one in your head!Da plane, da plane!! This's something you'll never be able to do in your lifetime.So you just watch from a distance... and wish."
Woman Lounging on Sea Plane,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"He's quite handsome, isn't he?......Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you.I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond... He even looks good in a double-breasted suit."
Sailor,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear.Oops! You must be those AVALANCHE guys!Quick! Let's get outta here! Heidegger's in charge of the transport ship.That's tough for both of us.The transport ship won't be sailing for quite a while. Heidegger's orders.
Sailor Running Around,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Rufus complimented me on my job!Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work.
Shinra Manager,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Oh, oh, oh!!! I'm gonna quit this company!!I mean it, I'm really gonna quit!!Heidegger's such an idiot!!And Rufus, acting all big!!God, that sure felt good..."
Woman at the Information Kiosk,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Say, aren't you bored?"
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"- Not that much- Yeah, we fight a lot"
Woman at the Information Kiosk,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Oh, really? I'm a little bored.Come on, back to work now!"
Woman at the Information Kiosk,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Isn't that good? You're just expecting too much.
Woman at the Information Kiosk,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Here you are! The Costa del Sol tourist information guide.What do you want to know?
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,- Where's the inn?- Where're the stores?- Show me around town.
Woman at the Information Kiosk,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Let's see. I recommend a resort located on the outskirts of the city.
Woman at the Information Kiosk,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"If you're looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's."
Woman at the Information Kiosk,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Wait a minute. I'm going to look at my guidebook.It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West. And has a prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages.Come on! I don't care about that!If you want a good time, come to the beach! There are lots of beautiful women.You wouldn't happen to be... rich?"
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"- Oh yeah...- Well, not so"
Woman at the Information Kiosk,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"You're kidding! You can't tell just by looking.But I'll tell you just in case.After relaxing at Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a rich and exciting place to play!Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park.But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it.But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once."
Woman at the Information Kiosk,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"I thought so.Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer.Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park.But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it.But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once."
Man,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"What a fluffy bed...... feels so great......Mmm... Just a little longer......Oh!!Oh, I'm sorry...... I didn't know you were here. This is embarrassing.Take your time and look around.By the way, are you seriously considering buying?"
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,- The heck do ya mean?- I'm out of here
Man,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"That's pretty low. Are you pulling my leg?I'm talking about this house. This villa used to belong to President Shinra. It only recently came back on the market.How do you like it?It has a large lot, comes fully furnished with this goose-down bed, and there's even a basement to boot.The villagers call it the Shinra Villa.Of course, we're not giving it away..."
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,- How much is it?- Not interested
Man,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Wha? How do you plan to buy it without a dime on you?Well, I'll tell the price just for your information.It's a steal at 300,000 gil. Out of your range? Out! Go on, out!Hmm... Is this some kind of joke?"
Man,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, please continue.Well, what do you think? Isn't it a fabulous villa?The feeling you get with owning a villa is simply... how should I say? ...indescribable.Well, let's wait for the captain."
Man,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, please continue.Well, what do you think? Isn't it a fabulous villa?The feeling you get with owning a villa is simply... how should I say? ...indescribable.Well, let's wait for the captain."
Man,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"'Praise the Lord,' it's a miracle!! Who'd ever think someone with some real money would ever come here...... I probably shouldn't even ask, but Are you really going to buy it?"
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"- Yep, 300,000 gil- I changed my mind"
Man,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Hmm, good-bye!! Good-bye fluffy bed!!"
Man,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Oh well I'm kind of glad!
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,This is MY villa. Rest up in your new villa?- With pleasure- Gotta move on
Manager,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yes sir!!Oh, those items are free, so please help yourself....SNORE... SNORE...Geez my lower back's killing me!Y, yes... sir!!How do you do! I'm the .Nice to meet you.Well, if you'll pardon me, I'll be leaving. Good-night."
Waitress,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,You want drink? Iz ok. You take time.
Surfer,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,We're all headin' over to Gold Saucer now.We're gonna make a ton of money at the Chocobo races.Then we're gonna take a trip to Icicle Inn and snowboard.
Surfer 2,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yeah, snowboarding's what's happening this year.I'm sick of surfing."
Black Man,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,...huff... puff... I can't stand hot places...
Man,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,......HIC... Mm? Wanna order? We're outta that now.

Woman Behind Counter,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Hey! I thought you'd drop by.(That's 1, 2... 4 fishes all together...... not bad.)"
Women Walking Around,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Shall we play our hand around here?Not yet. Remember, no compromises.You're right. After all, this trip was expensive.But only your average Joes are trying to pick us up.Well, that's because we're just too beautiful and hard to approach.I guess so. Well, I envy the plain Janes.Why don't we compromise? We'll make do with what we have.Not yet. Remember, no compromises."
Red XIII,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Hm, that's interesting.It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to.You see, this tail of mine, moves quite independently of my will."
Little Girl,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I heard. That big dog talks like a human.That's cool... but it's weird.
Red XIII,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Grrr.......
Little Boy,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"1, 2, 3, here we go!"
Little Girl,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,It's the ocean. A creepy man was signaling for us to come.I was scared to come here!
Butch,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Well, we're lucky to have that cutie working for us part-time."
Yuffie,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Ah, Cloud! Let me make a buck why don't you?I'm sellin' Materia. Why don't you buy some!?"
Butch,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yeah, I'd like to hire a gorgeous chick and have a great time."

Innkeeper,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Uggh! I feel God awful! Oh!! You!Weren't you the one with that big sailor?
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,- Dunno what you're talking about- Wasn't me
Innkeeper,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Listen to this...All of a sudden, this big sailor just busts in here, and takes over the restroom.He's been in there moaning ever since.I don't know what I'm gonna do.Ah...... if you're checking in, would you please pay his bill, too?"
Innkeeper,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Wrong guy? It puts us in a bad situation. That guy's taken over the john.And he hasn't even paid his hotel bit yet.Ah...... if you're checking in, would you please pay his bill, too?"

Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"- Who are YOU?- I'm , and don't forget it"
Johnny,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"That's right. Long time no see. Do you remember me?That's okay. We'll just keep on like we don't know each other.I'm starting a new life in this town.A lot of things happened to us. Heh, I better stop my mumbling! I sure envy you all just living outside with the sky as your ceiling."
Johnny,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"You think you're good enough to go around bragging about who you are?I don't wanna here it! Heh, no more mumbling from me!From now on, I'm starting a new life!"
Woman in Bathroom,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I'm sorry about that. He's had some big shocks lately and is pretty depressed.
Johnny,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Hurry up and get out of here!I'm happy like this. So keep out of my life.
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Oh! Cloud!!
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Look, look at that!"
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Hm...?- Who, Hojo...?- That girl in the bikini......?"
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Go over and talk to him.
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,What're you looking at?That man over there. That's Hojo from Shinra. Get outta here Go talk to him!
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Go over and talk to him.
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I have a bad feeling about this.
Men on the Beach,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,heh heh...... All the good ones are gone.
Men on the Beach,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"What about that one? Shall we make do with her?But she's got a guy with her.No problem, I can handle him.Right? You thought so, too?"
Men on the Beach,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Geez! What about those two?Heh heh...... I want the one on the left.Well then, I guess that leaves me with the one on the right."
Woman,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,God!! What do you want?
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,- I want to talk with that man- Is that Hojo?
Woman,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"(Hey, who do you think you are?)Professor Hojo. That scary man says he wants to talk with you."
Woman,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"(What's his problem?)Yes, that's right. It's the Professor!Professor... someone's here to see you, sir."
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I'm busy right now.
Someone,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,......But. Too bad.
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Heh heh heh...... All right. You sure are loud.Long time no see, Cloud."
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Hojo......
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Sometimes you just gotta do something like this.
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,......What are you doing?
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"It should be obvious, I'm getting a tan."
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Answer me!
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Hmm! I believe we're both after the same goal.
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,You mean Sephiroth?
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Did you see him?
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I see...... Ha! Ha!
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,What is it?
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Nothing. I just remembered a certain hypothesis......Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you?Or that you had to visit some place?......
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I'll go anywhere Sephiroth is at!To beat him and put an end to all this!
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,I see...... This could be interesting.Were you in SOLDIER? .......Heh heh heh! Would you like to be my guinea pig?
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Oh, now what? Are you going to draw your sword?"
Barret,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yo, yo! It's a bad idea to kill him."
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Cloud, don't. If he dies, we won't find out anything!"
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Stop, Cloud! I know how you feel, but you mustn't."
Red XIII,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"...huff... puff... Stop, Cloud!"
Yuffie,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Knock it off, Cloud! Look I don't know, but he knows a lot of stuff, right?"
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Ha! Ha! Ha!......
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"I'm . The least you can do is remember my name.I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo...I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me."
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Your mother? Oh, you mean Ifalna.How is she?"
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,You didn't know!? She died.
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,......I see.
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Professor Hojo...Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have the same blood?
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,......mumble... mumble... head west......
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,He's mumbling slowly... That must mean he's hiding something!
Hojo,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,..................
Red XIII,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Grrr, Grrr......... ...huff... puff..."
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Hey! Answer us!!
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,......It's no use. It's no go.
Woman,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,He never takes off his lab coat even in this heat. I guess that's the mark of an intellectual.
Woman 2,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"I'll interpret Professor Hojo's whispers.Head west, past Mt. Corel and keep going......Did you get that? I didn't understand it well, myself."
Woman 3,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"I'd be happy to be a guinea pig, if it's for Professor Hojo!"
Man Swimming,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yipes!! Help!!...breath... breath...! Kind of takes your breath away, don't it!?"
Man on Beach,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"If you're headed for Mt. Corel, then you'd better buy some ""Soft"".At least that's what they always say, don't they?Be prepared, and you'll never fear.Hey, I'm no idiot. I NEVER count my chickens before they hatch! Pretty good, huh?"
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Oh, right! I remember that, too."
Johnny,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yeah, yeah! And you remember the time when......?"
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Hee, hee, hee!"
Johnny,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Ha, ha, ha!......"
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Ha, ha... oh stop it! That's right. Oh really......"
Johnny,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yeah. Oh yeah, and then that time......"
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yeah, yeah!"
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Cloud, would you mind leaving us alone for the day?We haven't seen each other for ages and sometimes it's fun to talk about old times for a change.We'll try not to be too late.So please don't worry about us!"
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,- Worry......?- Yeah......
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,You're right......
Tifa,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Ok, I know."
Johnny,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yeah, so don't get mad or anything."
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Whew... I don't know why I'm so tired.There's so many things I don't understand......I feel a little uneasy.Cloud...?What do you think of me?
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,- I dunno- Nothing much
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"......You're right.Even I don't understand myself.I wonder what part of me is like an Ancient?What is an Ancient supposed to be like? It's strange, isn't it?I don't understand it......Ahh...... I'm going around in circles. I wonder if there's any answer to this. Everything's so complicated.I'm going on to bed."
Aeris,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"How could you say such a thing! Sometimes you make me so mad!Oh, I never should have brought this up!!I don't want to talk about it!"
Innkeeper,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Welcome!! What's it going to be?200 gil a night.
Cloud,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,- Stay- Changed my mind.
Innkeeper,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"You must be tired.Tomorrow in the Costa del Sol area the weather is going to be...... sunny, again.Cradled by the sound of the ocean waves...... Sweet dreams..."
Innkeeper,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Good morning. Be careful traveling.Your party has departed.Oops......That's bad luck......I mean, they have already left."
Innkeeper,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,You sure? I'll just be playing around here so drop by whenever you feel like it.
Butch,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"You got me there...... We just hired her part-time.She ran off with our money and Materia.I guess a situation that's too good to be true, usually is.Well, please feel free to browse around. Just don't mind looking at what's left."
Woman,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"That's right!! It totally skipped my mind!There was something I was supposed to tell you.That's right! It's about that!It was yesterday. A man wearing a black cloak came up from the ocean.I think he had tickets for the Gold Saucer... no, that wasn't it... I wonder if it was all just an illusion?"
Man on the Beach,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Hey...... heh heh...... don't forget to talk to me, too."
Woman 2,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Hey! President Rufus came here yesterday.He used to be the President's little boy. We nicknamed him the little Prez!He didn't look much different than the surfers on the beach.
Man Swimming,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,Eeeew!! Leave me alone!Ublk! Glug... glug...... You're gonna drown... I'm
Woman 3,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"Yes, Professor Hojo. Where...?It looks like the Professor discovered or found a solution to something.You know, I wonder...... if they headed west for Mt. Corel?I'm getting a little sad.Professor Hojo looks happy like a child when he discovers something. He gets this big smile and then laughs......I guess we should chase after him. A vacation for two from Mt. Corel to Gold Saucer."
Johnny,Costa del Sol - Taking a Break,"mumble... mumble... (Tifa, promise me you're gonna be happy.)"
Old Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Whew!!Hey!You're actually talking to me.
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,What is it?
Old Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"I just passed a guy in a black cloak back there.I just tried to tell him that it's dangerous up ahead, and he ignored me!"
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Sephiroth...
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,............ahh.
Aeris,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"There was a black-cloaked guy here, too?"
Tifa,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Let's hurry on.
Red XIII,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Hmm...... I'm moving on ahead...
Yuffie,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Oh gawd, what a drag!!"
Old Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"It's dangerous up ahead. Be careful on your way.If any strangers should greet you warmly while traveling, make sure to greet them back.Whew! I guess that's the fun of being on the road."
Aeris,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Cloud!!I was just wishing you were here!Unless someone lets down the bridge, we're stuck.Cloud should be able to do something.But let's take a breather first."
Tifa,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,OH!! Cloud! That's it!We can't go on until the bridge is let down.I think there's a switch in that shack over there...But there's too many monsters around and I'm beat...
Red XIII,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Wha? Oh, it's you.There seems to be an instrument in that hut that manipulates this bridge.Perhaps it's best if we rest a moment."
Aeris,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Come on, Cloud. Let's rest a minute."
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Ok, then...- PHS- Let's move on!"
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,......whew!
Aeris,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"I'm sure glad I'm with you, Cloud!"
Tifa,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,I'm beat...
Red XIII,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,What...?
Yuffie,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,I'm pooped!
Aeris,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Oh, Cloud!! Good Luck!!"
Tifa,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Cloud!! Go Cloud!! Go!!
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"OW!! Sure is tight in here...Come on, , don't let it get to you. Let's see... this is it.Maybe if I turn this......something should happen.- Do it- Leave it"

Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Hey! How'd you ever wind up around here?Look, I'm sorry but, I can't do a thing for you!Oh boy!! Corel sure has gone to pot. It used to be a famous coal mining town!They say there were more jobs than you could shake a...Well, you get the picture!Now, it's nothing but a miserable pit! Me, my bulldozer... everything's out of work.Got no job... I can't even show my face. 'Bout all that's left for me is to just live in this hole all day."
Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"You, you're...Hey!! He's back!"
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Wait here...
Men,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again.Those people over there, they with you?Well, I feel sorry for 'em! Hangin' around a walkin' death sentence like Barret."
Men,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again.They kick you out of another town or somethin'?You destroy everything you touch."
Men,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,You got a lot of balls comin' back here!Look at this place! It's all your fault North Corel turned into a garbage heap!Why doncha say something!?Or did ya forget what you done here already?
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,...I'm sorry...

Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,You heard 'em... It's my fault this town was... destroyed...
Big Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,YOU know who's responsible for North Corel winding up like this!
Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Get out of the way!!The only way we can make ends meet around here now is by collecting junk!
Old Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,The next train's coming in soon.
Black Woman,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Grandpa used to be a Coal Train engineer.He still can't kick his old habits from then.
Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"I want to leave this garbage dump of a town behind me, and start a new life.If I had a buggy, I'd cross the southern desert, and go to that town across the river..."
Woman,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Everyone knows that accident couldn't have been avoided.But no one will be satisfied until someone takes the blame.
Kid,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"There was something glowing in that well over there.If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the Gold Saucer!"
Tool Shopkeeper,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Please buy something! Anything will do!
General Store Shopkeeper,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,What do you want?
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,- Buy- Listen to your story- Not interested
General Store Shopkeeper,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,(when asked for a story)Take that road on the left to the Ropeway station!The Ropeway'll take you to the Gold Saucer.It don't mean much to us poor folks though...
Weapon Shopkeeper,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"If you want to survive, then you're gonna need some of my weapons."
Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,How am I supposed to continue living in a town that's lost everything...?To hell with the Mako reactor!
Woman,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Because of them...... ugh. My husband got into that accident... He used to be such a strong man...
Little Girl,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Yaaay!! What do you wanna play?
Man in Hardhat,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,I hear it's a big fad now in the city to get tattoos. Is that right?
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,- I wouldn't know- That's right
Man in Hardhat,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Really...? I saw a big '1' on the arm of a young guy heading towards the Ropeway. That Black Cape he had on was really cool.
Man in Hardhat,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"I guess I should get a '0' tattoo! For a poor man like me, '0' oughtta be perfect."
Innkeeper,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Welcome. It's 50 gil a night. Would you like a room?
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,- Yes- No
Innkeeper,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Enjoy your stay.
Innkeeper,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Please come again.
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,We're moving!?This is bad!Hoo boy... There's no way we can walk across now.Not even a Chocobo could make it across... Isn't there a more powerful vehicle?
Aeris,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Barret, what happened?"
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Sorry.
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,What happened?
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,My hometown used to be around here.
Red XIII,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,What do you mean 'used to'?
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried... in just 4 years.
Aeris,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,But how could those people say those terrible things?
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,An' it's my fault. ALL my fault.
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"(narrating)...My hometown, Corel's always been a coal mining town.It's so dusty, but calm and so poor...... a real small town, this one.That's the first time I ever heard the word ""Mako Reactor"" mentioned since that time..."
Village Headman,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,What are we going to do? The only one against this is Dyne...
Dyne,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal!Our coal's been protected for generations. Our fathers, and theirs before them, risked their lives for it.We have no right to throw it all away so easily!"
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of the times."
Scarlet,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Right, everything is Mako, now.It'll be all right, Dyne. Shinra, Inc. will guarantee your livelihood once the Mako Reactor is completed."
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Listen, Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore."
Dyne,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"I know how you feel! I feel the same way too, damn it!But even so, I won't give away our coal mines!"
Village Headman,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Dyne... you've got to understand.
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,(narrating)That's how the Corel Reactor was built..... and completed.We all thought it would bring us an easier life.
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,(narrating)It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days.Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops.All the townspeople... All my relatives...... Everyone... everything......
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Shinra troops? What for!?
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,There was an explosion at a reactor.Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a rebel faction.
Tifa,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,That's so terrible!
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't forgive myself.Never should've gone along with the building of the reactor..."
Tifa,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra made back then.
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"That's why... that's why I get so pissed off!!Not only did they take advantage of me...... But I lost my wife, Myrna, too..."
Station Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"Hey everyone! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and get on!Ride the Ropeway?"
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,- Go on- Don't go on
Cloud,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Let's get on.
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...
Tifa,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,I never knew. Barret never said a thing...
Aeris,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,.........
Red XIII,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,.........
Yuffie,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"I'm not sympathizing with Barret! He never should have trusted Shinra, Inc. ..."
Tifa,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,.........We better go on!
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...
Yuffie,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,I'm waiting inside.
Tifa,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,I never knew. Barret never said a thing...
Aeris,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,Everything Shinra does seem to make everyone miserable...
Red XIII,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,.........
Barret,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,It's all my fault...
Station Man,Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town,"The Ropeway takes you to the 'Gold Saucer'. It's free, so don't worry about it."

Man,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,"You can only buy up to 3 tickets. Think before you buy. For example, you could select half of the Chocobos and buy 3 boxes."
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,- Boxes?- Not interested
Man,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,"A box is buying 3 combinations of 2 chocobos.For example, if you select Chocobo 1, 3, and 5, you can purchase combinations, such as 1-3, 1-5, 3-5.You can also play the limited wheel by selecting a Chocobo."
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,- Limited wheel?- Not interested
Man,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,"Playing a 'Limited wheel' means you select a Chocobo and use it in all of your combinations.For example, if you have Chocobo 1, then you buy 1-2, 1-3, 1-4.No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. It all comes down to insight and luck."
Security,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,"(near Jockey Lounge)I'm sorry, but this is for authorized personnel only."
Blond Man,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,"We usually buy tickets for the B rank and C rank races, right?"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,- Rank?- Not interested
Blond Man,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,"In other words, 'rank' means the Chocobo's 'strength'. A is highest and C's the lowest.When you become a Free Chocobo jockey, you'll be able to buy A rank tickets.Of course, the higher the rank, the better your item ticket. Hey, maybe I'll become a Chocobo jockey!?"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,- How DO you become one?- Not interested
Blond Man,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,You can become one if you own a Chocobo... and have some connections. But Chocobo's are pretty hard to catch and I don't have any connections.
Woman,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,"Hey, what's that Chocobo on the odds sheet?"
Redhead,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,That's how you can find out a Chocobo's condition and strengths.
Woman,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,"Hmm, If you can tell which ones are the strongest, then it's easy..."
Redhead,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,"Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the Chocobo's strength,but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's personality.If these are bad, they may use too much stamina, and affect other things."

He still can't seem to get off the ground..."
Narration,Gold Saucer - Meeting Cait Sith,Looks like he's still got a long way to go...Here's where you come in. Help Mog learn how to fly by pushing O button and feeding him his favorite Kupo nut.But don't overfeed him. He won't be able to fly if he's too fat.

Black Man,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Those guys only tell lies. Only lies. Not a one of 'em will tell you the truth.Just talk with 'em a couple of times, and you'll get sick of them."

Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,You guys...
Red XIII,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,I heard that the murders at the Battle Arena were done by a man with a gun-arm. ...Was that you?
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,There's another... another man that got a gun grafted inta one of his arms. It was four years ago...
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,(narrating)I remember... I was on my way home from visiting a Mako Reactor being built.
Village Headman,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Barret! Dyne! Come quick! The village's being attacked! It's Shinra soldiers!
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,What!!!?

Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Yeah... I ain't lettin' go...You're comin' back... Everyone's waitin' for ya...Eleanor... and Marlene... They all waitin' on us...
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more....I was depressed for a while.But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted in.Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took everything away...Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got the same operation as me.But, his was the left arm."
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,......
Aeris,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"But... Dyne's injury was the same as yours, right?"
Tifa,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Yeah, that's right. He was deceived by the Shinra too.He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra."
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"...wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can rest in peace.An' that's why, I gotta go alone."
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Do whatever you want... Is that what you want to hear?Well, I can't let you do it. Because, if you die on me, I'm gonna have nightmares."
Aeris,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Barret, this isn't the end."
Tifa,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Weren't you going to save the Planet?
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Shit! Tifa, you oughtta know by now."
Tifa,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,...That's all right. I'm not so different from you.
Aeris,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"That's easier to understand. It's you, Barret."
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"So there it is, Barret. So I guess it'll be Barret, me, and......"
Aeris,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,I wonder if Dyne will join us?
Tifa,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Be careful.
Red XIII,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Hmm? Shall I go with you?
Yuffie,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"You sure are all acting pretty heroic, considerin' we're not makin' any money on this..."
Cait Sith,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Fortune's good. Everything is perfect!
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,This one's been shot too...
Man,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,", the Boss was REALLY in a bad mood today... Or was it one of his better days?If you get lost in the desert, just keep going Northeast. If you're lucky, you'll make it back here."
Carriage Driver,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Wanna ride...?
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,- Get on- Don't get on
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,...Dyne ...Is that you?
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years...A voice I'll never forget...
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday...I knew you were alive somewhere... we had the same operation.Listen to me Dyne. I want to...
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,What's that? ......I hear her voice.
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,......?
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"I hear her voice, Eleanor's voice. Begging me... not to hate your rotten guts.That's why I didn't hunt you down..."
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,...I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me.But... What're you doin' in a place like this?Why ya wanna kill those that ain't even involved? Why?
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,...Why!? The hell do you care for!?Are the people killed going to understand 'why'? Are the people of Corel going to understand just hearing Shinra's excuses?I don't CARE what the reason is!All they give us are artillery and stupid excuses... What's left is a world of despair and emptiness...
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,......
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"You still want to hear 'why'? ...All right, I'll tell you.'Cause I want to destroy everything."
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Dyne, Marlene...... Marlene's still alive."
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,......?
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure.That is why I wanted to be by her side till the end.That's when I found her... ...found Marlene.
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,...
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?"
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"So...... she's still alive...All right, Barret. I guess that means you and I gotta fight."
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,What!?
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Eleanor's alone all by herself. I've got to take Marlene to her.
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Dyne... are you insane!?
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Marlene wants to see her Mom, don't she?"
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Stop, Dyne! I can't die yet!"
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Oh yeah? Well my life's been over ever since then.
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Stop it! I don't wanna fight you!
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Barret!
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Cloud, you stay the hell out of it! This is MY problem!!"
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Urgh!
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Dyne... I don't know either, man.Is this the only way... we can resolve this?"
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,I told you... I... I want to destroy everything...Everything... This crazy world... Even me...
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,An' what 'bout Marlene? What's gonna happen to her!?
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,...Think about it... Barret... How old was Marlene back then...?Even if I did go to her now... she wouldn't even know me...And what's more... Barret...These hands are a little too stained to carry Marlene anymore...
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,......
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Barret...
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,All right...
Dyne,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,...wow... Marlene's... already...... 4......
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Dyne...?Dyne!
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Dy------ne!!
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,You want somethin'?
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,I want to go up.
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Like I told you before, you gotta get the Boss' permission, then win the Chocobo......"
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Dyne's got his reasons an' can't speak.
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Yeah, bull--!!"
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,I want to go up.
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"R, right.Did you kill Dyne?You must've. Or you'd never be holding that thing....So Dyne's dead... Maybe now, the place'll calm down a little.Dyne didn't care who anyone was......"
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,The hell do YOU know!!
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"R... ri...... right! I mean, no, I DON'T know anything. S, s... sorry."
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Then, will you get us outta here?"
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Huh? Oh man, you guys are mistaken.I already told you, there's only one way to get outta here.That's to win the Chocobo Race and that's held up there, in the Gold Saucer.And, only one racer can go up at a time."
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Say what!?
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Noooo! Really, even if you threaten me!!A rule's a rule. I can't change it.If I do, the whole system down here'll get messed up!! An' I can't do that!Okay, ok, I'll let one go up there. After that, he's gotta deal with Dio."
Barret,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Awright then.Cloud, you go.We'll wait down here.Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here!"
Aeris,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Yes, good luck, Cloud."
Tifa,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Right, Cloud. We'll be waiting and rooting for you."
Red XIII,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,You're right. Cloud should do it.
Yuffie,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Well, Cloud go get 'em!"
Cait Sith,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Ok Cloud, knock 'em dead!"
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Have you decided?All you need now is a manager....and register and get a Chocobo...
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Hi...... I happened to hear your story.
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Ester?
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,I'll be your manager.
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Well, I have nothing against it, but...This is Ester. She may look kinda funny...But there's no better manager in the races..."
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"That's so rude...Yeah, well. Nice to meet you, Cloud."
Mr. Coates,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"All right then, Cloud.I'll send you up the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the details."
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Hmm, so that's what happened. I'll talk to Dio directly. You just concentrate on the race.Oh yeah, getting back to the other thing, there are many different types of Chocobo jockeys. It's not only for criminals.Some people compete for the fame, some people compete for the money, some for glory... And then there're people like you.Oh yeah, I'll teach you how to ride a Chocobo."
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,- All right- Not interested
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Ummm... First use the [Select] button to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on its own.But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.You can't really help on this one.But, most of the Chocobo's that I'll provide you with are mellow and you should be able to handle them.When you're riding, use the [] Button to Speed Up and the X Button to Slow Down.But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose its stamina really fast.And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use the O Button to get a boost of speed.Of course your stamina runs out faster though.There are some bad tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast.For these kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on Manual and slow it down.Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,Push the [Start] button to end the race."
Man,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,You new?
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Hi, Joe."
Joe,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Hey, Ester you're looking pretty as usual."
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Thanks.Let me introduce you, Cloud.This is Joe, one of the top Chocobo Jockeys."
Joe,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Nice to meet you, Cloud.If you're with Ester, then..."
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Right! He's an up and coming jockey.He's only been down here for a day and already he made it up here!!
Joe,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"What!?Oh, I see...So what did you do down there?Sorry... you're not supposed to ask about the past here...Pretty interesting... I have a feeling that we'll meet again.Then, until we meet again, Cloud."
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,I'm going to check on the Chocobo. You just wait here for a while.I'll be right back.
Jockeys,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,......I got nothing to say.......Don't get cocky. Skills don't matter once you get in the race...
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,CloudThanks for waiting. I registered you in the next race.This is a Chocobo I prepared myself. He won't lose easily.Oh yeah... You know how to ride one?
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"- Uh, how was it again?- Yeah, I got it"
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Then, good luck."
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,Too bad.
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Let me find a better Chocobo for you. Wait here for a while, OK?"
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"If you couldn't win with that last Chocobo...All right, I'll go get the best Chocobo there is!"
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"You gotta be kidding me!? There aren't any other Chocobos better than the last one!Well, if you really want to win, just push the 'SELECT'and try the 'AUTO' mode."
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Congratulations!! Now you're home free!Oh yeah, the owner told me to give this letter to you when you won."
Dio,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Boy, if you're reading this letter, then you must've won. And won a victory that I am sure you earned.I heard about Dyne from Ester. Now that you are victorious, I promise that you and all your friends will get a full pardon, and you all will be set free.And also, by way of apology, I prepared a little gift for you to use on your journey.Sorry I couldn't be there to tell you this in person, but I'm a very busy man.Sincerely,"
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,A gift?
Aeris,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"Cloud, isn't this great!? The assistant manager just stopped by and dropped off a 'buggy' for you!Now you can go over 'deserts' and 'rivers' no problem.OK, Cloud. I'll be waiting outside."
Cloud,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"(Hmm? The letter continues...)P.S. I just recently met Sephiroth. He must have a lot of fans with boys your age.Why don't you get his autograph? It seems he's headed toward the South of the river, towards Gongaga.Sephiroth..."
Ester,Corel Prison - Confronting Dyne,"I guess this is goodbye.Yeah. Well, if you ever get your own Race Chocobo, come back again.I'll take care of your registration and everything. I'll see you again."
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,...Is someone there?
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Hey, Rude. Who do you like?"
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,What are you getting so embarrassed about? Come on? Who do you like?
Rude,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,.........Tifa.
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Hmmmm...That's a tough one.But, poor Elena. She...... you......"
Rude,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"No, she likes Tseng."
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I never knew that! But Tseng likes that Ancient...
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,What are they talking about?
Elena,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,It's so stupid!They always talk about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is different.Ah! Oh no!
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Hmm... Then it's time...Rude... Don't go easy on them even though they're girls.
Rude,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"...Don't worry, I'll do my job."
Elena,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Then, we're counting on you. I'll report to Tseng!"
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,It's been a while.
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Payback time for what you did in Sector 7.
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,- Sector 7?- Out of our way
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,That's sad.
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I don't like being taken for a fool.
Rude,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,That's as far as you go.
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,This is just part of the job. Don't take it personally.
Reno,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"We may be retreating, but...we're still victorious!"
Rude,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,...............
Barret,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I don't like it. How'd they find out where we were?
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,...How could they know we were coming here.
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Hey, something seems wrong, Like they knew we were coming."
Red XIII,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Interesting... They were definitely waiting for us.
Yuffie,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I don't like this! It's like the whole world knows where we're going.
Cait Sith,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,How'd they know that we were here?
Vincent,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,How did they know that we were here...
Cid,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Man, looks like they've taken a short cut."
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"They followed us...... But there weren't any signs of it. Then, that means......"
Barret,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"A spy, maybe? No, no way."
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,That there's a Shinra spy...
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,A spy!?...No way.
Red XIII,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,......someone's been informing them.
Yuffie,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Maybe it's someone in this group?
Cait Sith,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"You don't think there's a spy, do you Cloud?I hate this. Now everyone's gonna blame me because I'm new."
Vincent,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Means there's a Shinra spy...?
Cid,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,And a couple of Shinra dogs are here too!
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I don't even want to think that there's a spy...I trust everyone.
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,A ruined reactor.
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"It's Scarlet, Head of Shinra Weapon Development."
Scarlet,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"......Hmph! This isn't any good either.You only get junky materia from junky reactors.This reactor's a failure.What I'm looking for is big, large, huge materia. You seen any?"
Tseng,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,...No I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away.
Scarlet,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Please. We could make the ultimate weapon if we only had some.
Tseng,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I just can't wait.
Scarlet,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"With Hojo gone, the Weapon Development's been betting a bigger budget."
Tseng,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I envy them.
Scarlet,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"But, even if we make the perfect weapon, could that stupid Heidegger even use it?"
Tseng,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,......
Scarlet,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Oh... sorry! I forgot Heidegger was your boss! Ha ha ha!
Tseng,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,......
Scarlet,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Let's go!
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"...Big, large, huge materia?An ultimate weapon? The perfect weapon?Just what are the Shinra up to...?"
Old Man,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"............No matter how much I pray, it won't bring our grandson back..."
Redhead,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Three years ago when the reactor exploded, my husband...Do people really need reactors to live?Aren't there more important things in life...?"
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,A ruined reactor.
Accessory Shopkeeper,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Huh...... did you want something?
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,- Buy accessories?- Hear a story?- Nothing in particular
Accessory Shopkeeper,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"We voted to outlaw the use of Mako energy and live with nature, ever since the explosion.People can live without the Shinra's Mako Reactors."
Accessory Shopkeeper,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,They sell the weapons on the second floor. Climb up the pole to get there.
Weapons Shopkeeper,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,...You want something?
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,- Hear a story?
Weapons Shopkeeper,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in it...Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result.It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find pieces of it left all over town."
Item Shopkeeper,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Oh... you here to shop?
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,- Hear a story?
Item Shopkeeper,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in it...Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result.It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find pieces of it left all over town."
Innkeeper,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Uh... need somethin'?
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,- Need a room?- Hear a story?- Nothing in particular
Innkeeper,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,It's 80 Gil a night.
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,- Pay up- Don't pay
Innkeeper,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in it...Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result.It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find pieces of it left all over town."
Mayor,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"This is Gongaga Village. Many people died here in a Mako reactor explosion.The Shinra people told us that everyone would be happy once the Reactor was built. But, all it brought us was sadness......"
Zack's Father,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"You a traveller? Hey wait, that glare in your eye... you in SOLDIER?"
Zack's Mother,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Oh you're right! Don't you know anything about our son?
Zack's Father,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,His name is Zack.
Zack's Mother,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"It's been close to 10 years since he left for the city, saying that he didn't want to live in the country..."
Zack's Father,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,He left saying he's going to join SOLDIER. You ever hear of a Zack in SOLDIER?
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Hmmm... I don't know.
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Hmmm... I don't know.
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Zack...
Zack's Father,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Young lady, you know him?"
Zack's Mother,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a girlfriend. Could that have been you?
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,That can't...
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Zack...
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,What happened to you two?
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Hmm.. I don't know.
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Zack...
Zack's Father,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Young lady, you know him?"
Zack's Mother,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a girlfriend. Could that have been you?
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,That can't...
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Aeris...
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Hmmm... I don't know.
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Zack...
Zack's Father,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Young lady, you know him?"
Zack's Mother,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a girlfriend. Could that have been you?
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"...No, it wasn't."
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Tifa... What happened?
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Aeris...
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,What a shock... I didn't know Zack was from this town.
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,You know him?
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Didn't I tell you? He was my first love.
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,............
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Zack... SOLDIER First Class. Same as Cloud.
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Strange, there aren't that many who make First Class, but I've never heard of him."
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,That's all right. It's all in the past now. I was just worried because I heard he's been missing.
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Missing?
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"I think it was 5 years ago. He went out on a job, and never came back.He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone else...Hey? What's wrong?"
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,- Poor guy- (...jealous... envious...)
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I don't really mind that I haven't heard from him. But I feel for his parents.
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Are you... jealous? Hmm? Hmmm? Are you, Cloud?"
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
Aeris,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Let's go, Cloud."
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Zack......
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Do you know him?
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"N, no, I don't know him!"
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Your face tells me differently.
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"I told you, I don't!"
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"A, all right."
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"............That sounds just like you, leaving town, and saying 'I'm joining SOLDIER!'."
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,There were a lot of guys like that back then.
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,You must really be something making it in SOLDIER out of a group like that.I really respect you...
Cloud,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,- I just got lucky- I worked hard for it
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Don't be so humble!
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Hard work pays off, huh."
Tifa,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"Cloud, thanks for caring."
Zack's Father,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,Have you ever met someone in SOLDIER named Zack?
Zack's Mother,Gongaga - A Ruined Reactor,"I can't believe he hasn't contacted us in 10 years...! ...After all, we're his parents."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,!?
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Oh man... a breakdown? Now?
Red XIII,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"I am home! It is I, Nanaki!"
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Hey, Nanaki! You're safe!Come on, and say hello to Bugenhagen!"
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,...Nanaki?
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,I finally made it... So this is... Cosmo Canyon!
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Cosmo... Canyon? I wonder if there's any relation to the planet or the Ancients...
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Red XIII seems different, doesn't he?"
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Hmmm... Any Materia? Any Materia around?
Cait Sith,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Hmmm... So this is Cosmo Canyon.
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Are you familiar with this land?
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,- Yes- No
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,You lied. That is something that is not treated lightly here in Cosmo Canyon.
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Let me explain.People from all over the world gather here to seek the Study of Planet Life.
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Wooooooooo!I always wanted to come here!
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Ummgah! It's full capacity at present, so I'm afraid I can't let you enter."
Red XIII,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,They helped me some when I was on the road. Please let them in.
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"...Oh, is that so? You helped our Nanaki? Please, come in."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Who is Nanaki?
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Nanaki is Nanaki. That's his name.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Here is where I was... I mean, ...this is my hometown.My tribe were protectors of those who appreciate this beautiful canyon and the Planet.My brave mother fought and died here, but my cowardly father left her...... I am the last of my race."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Cowardly father?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Yes. My father was a wastrel.And so the mission I inherited from my ancestors, is to protect this place. My journey ends here."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,(from above)Hey! Nanaki--! You're home!
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Coming, Grandpa!"
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Good timin'. Let's take a breather.I got stuff I want to find out, too."
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Let's rest for a bit. There are some things I want to find out about anyway.
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"That's perfect. Why don't we take a break too? We can meet back here in a while, OK?"
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Rest, rest, rest! I wanna rest! There! It's decided!"
Cait Sith,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"I'm just dead tired. Everyone, how 'bout some rest?"
Sign,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Tasty Cocktails! Pub ""Starlet""Fluffy Beds! In ""Shildra Inn""Come in today!It's right near Cosmo Candle!"
Barkeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Welcome. How 'bout our original cocktail, 'Cosmo Candle?'A drink now and then is good for you. It'll relax you a bit. ...If you know when to stop."
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Maybe there are some people here that know about the Promised Land and the Ancients.
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Nanaki...... I wonder what's happened to Nanaki...? He's as excited as a little boy.
Elder Bugah,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Is that so? You brought Nanaki back here?Yeah, thanks."
Innkeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Welcome to 'Shildra Inn'.It'll be 100 gil a night. Would you like to stay?
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,- Yes- No thanks
Innkeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Have a great dream of the stars...
Innkeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Were you able to hear the stars whispers?Well then, please come again."
Innkeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Well then, please come again."
Flyer on Wall,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"[Turtle's Paradise] No. 5Our cocktails are good but our wine is the best!Please stop in to ""Turtle's Paradise""!!"
Man,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,So this is Cosmo Canyon... Quite a mysterious place.Have you come to seek the 'Study of Planet Life'?
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,- That's it- No
Man,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Yeah? I heard there's an awesome observatory here. I'd like to see it if I have a chance.
Man,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Oh yeah? What? The car broke down!?Why don't you look around Cosmo Canyon, while I fix the car?"
Man,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Oh, really?There really isn't much else to see here."
Kid near the Cosmo Candle,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Yaaay! Nanaki! Nanaki's back! It's all thanks to this flame!This fire is called 'Cosmo Candle'. It has burned for generations.It is a holy flame that protects this canyon.I heard once, it only went out once, long ago.The elders said something horrifying occurred, but I really don't know much about it."
Item Shopkeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Hello. Looking for anything in particular?
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Since you're here, why don't you listen to Bugenhagen's story?"
Weapons Shopkeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Oh, welcome.The people of this canyon hate to compete. So almost everything here are replicas.But that's all right. Some of them you can really use."
Flyer on wall,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"[Turtle Paradise Newsletter] Number 4Now hiring!Looking for someone who can stand long hours of boredom!For details, contact Pub ""Turtle Paradise""!!"
Elder Hargo,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Where did I put it...? I know it's around here...
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"There was this guy who studied 'Planetary Life' here.He couldn't take things the way they were, so he went to Midgar to form AVALANCHE.Wanna hear more?"
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,- Go on- Not really
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"(on choosing ""Go on"")Guess you could say this is where AVALANCHE was born.I always wanted to come here... And... I finally...... made it.A lot... happened..."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"- And then?- Yeah, whatever..."
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"(on choosing ""And then?"")And then...? I don't know what's going to happen, now that there is no AVALANCHE..."
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Oh man! This place looks like a real drag. And their Materia sucks, too."
Materia Shopkeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"...num... yawn... Sir,... You... forgot...... your...... change....num... Yes, I'm coming...Are you here to shop?"
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"- That's right- No, what's your problem?"
Materia Shopkeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Oh... is that so... You're here to shop?
Shopkeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Oh... is that so... then leave me alone and let me... yawn... sleep...
Woman,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Oh man, I'm so busy. I need more help. Mummer... complaint..."
Woman,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Those two... uh, Anyway, are you two friends? It really seems strange."
Cait Sith,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Hmm, this place seems like it has a lot of secrets.So, when's dinner?"
Woman,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"All right, all right. I'm making it right now....But I wonder which one is going to eat..."
Kid outside Sealed Door,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Bugenhagen sealed this door shut.How'd he do that? With super glue?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Cloud, this is my grandfather, Bugen.He is incredible. He knows everything."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Ho Ho Hoooo. I hear that you looked after Nanaki a bit.Nanaki is still a child you see.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Please stop, grandfather. I'm 48."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Ho Ho Hoooo. Nanaki's tribe has incredible longevity.So you see his 48 years would only be equivalent to say that of a 15 or 16 year old in human reckoning.
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,15 or 16!?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,He's quiet and very deep. You thought he was an adult?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,......grandfather. I want to be an adult.I want to grow up to be able to protect you and the village.
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Ho Ho Hoooo. No Nanaki. You can't stand on your own yet.To do that now would destroy you in the long run.Reaching up into the heavens, threatening to snatch the very stars from the great city of Midgar. You've seen it, haven't you?Well, that's a bad example. Looking up too much makes you lose perspective.When it's time for this planet to die, you'll understand that you know absolutely nothing."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,......When the planet dies?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Ho Ho Hoooo. It may be tomorrow, or 100 years from now... But it's not long off."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,How do you know this?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,I hear the cries of the Planet.
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,What's that?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"The sounds of the stars in the heavens. While this goes on, planets are born, and die."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,What was that?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Ho Ho Hoooo. That was a scream from this planet.Didn't you hear it? As if to say... I hurt, I suffer......"
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,They have come here on a journey to save the planet.Why don't you show them your apparatus?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Ho Ho Hoooo. To save the planet? Ho Ho Hoooo!But, then again, I guess it wouldn't hurt to show him."
Kid,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,(walking in)Bugenhagen!Several odd looking people have come.
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,The whole place has gotten busy all of a sudden.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,He brought friends too. I'll go get them.
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Don't worry. My machine won't run away. You go and invite your friends.
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,What?
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Hmm?
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Are you going somewhere?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,(in his room)Don't worry about me. I've seen it many times.It's my first time back in a while. Let me rest for a bit...
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,God. I HATE studying!
Cait Sith,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,What did they say?
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Did you get to see Bugenhagen's contraption? If you haven't yet, you must!"
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Here, over here. The door's unlocked, come on in."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Ho Ho Hoooo. That's a machine only I can use.
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Ho Ho Hoooo. It looks like you have them all together. Then let's begin.I'll be stand there.
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,This is really somethin'!
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,So pretty... It's just like the real thing!
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Wow! It's just like the real thing!
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Woa! Wooooah! Pretty good, surprisin' me!"
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Hmm, yes pretty good. This is my laboratory.All the workings of space are entered into this 3D Holographic System."
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Whoa! Shootin' stars!
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Hey! A shooting star!
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Look, look! A shooting star!"
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Wh, what the? A shooting star?"
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,This's really somethin'!
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Wow, how wonderful."
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Oh! This is amazing!!
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Whew!!
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Ho Ho Hoooo. Yes, it is something, isn't it?Well, let's get to the subject.Eventually... all humans die. What happens to them after they die?The body decomposes, and returns to the Planet. That much everyone knows. What about their consciousness, their hearts and their souls?The soul too returns to the Planet.And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In fact, all living things in the universe, are the same.The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another and roam the Planet.They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 'Lifestream'.Lifestream... In other words, a path of energy of the souls roaming the Planet.'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget.A new life... children are blessed with Spirit energy and are brought into the world.Then, the time comes when they die and once again return to the Planet...Of course there are exceptions, but this is the way of the world.I've digressed, but you'll understand better if you watch this."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Spirit energy makes all things possible, trees, birds, and humans.Not just living things. But Spirit energy makes it possible for Planets to be Planets.What happens if that Spirit energy were to disappear?"
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,......These are the basics of the Study of Planet Life.
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"If the Spirit energy is lost, our Planet is destroyed..."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Ho Ho Hoooo. Spirit energy is efficient BECAUSE it exists within nature.When Spirit energy is forcefully extracted, and manufactured, it can't accomplish its true purpose."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"You're talking about Mako energy, right?"
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Everyday Mako reactors suck up Spirit energy, diminishing it.Spirit energy gets compressed in the reactors and processed into Mako energy. All living things are being used up and thrown away.In other words, Mako energy will only destroy the Planet..."
Elder Hargo,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Ahh, here it is.My job is to gather all the legends and the knowledge of the planet and to make a book.Then, even when I return to the planet, the children may still be taught about many things...Mmm? Oh, we have guests. Good, good.I know, I know.You came to ask me something, right? Am I right?"
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,- It's about the Promised Land- Not really
Elder Hargo,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"...The Promised Land. So you want to know...?There is no one place called the Promised Land. That's what I believe.No no, it does exist. Hmmm...... you can say that too.In other words, it doesn't exist for us, but it did for the Ancients.The Promised Land is the resting place of the Ancients.The life of the Ancients is one continuous journey. A journey to grow trees and plants, produce animals, and to raise Mako energy.Their harsh journeys continued throughout their lives...The place they returned to after their long journey... Their burial land is the Promised Land.Huh? Supreme Happiness? I believe that, for the Ancients, it was the moment that they were able to return to their Planet,At that moment they were released from their fate, and gained their supreme happiness...At least that's what I believe. I really don't know whether or not it's the truth now."
Elder Hargo,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Oh, that's not what you're here for?I'd appreciate it if you don't talk to me about such foolish things as legends and old wives tales."
Elder Hargo,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"By the way, those that came with you are all at the Cosmo Candle.Are you leaving?"
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Leaving already? But it appears your friends still want to learn more about the planet...
Elder Bugah,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Mmm...What is it?
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,- The story of the Ancients...- Nothing
Elder Bugah,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"You can't talk of the Ancients, without mentioning Professor Gast.He used to come here sometimes.He was a Shinra scholar who spent his life studying the Ancients.He was a serious person, never would have figured he'd be with the Shinra.Must've been about 30 years ago, when he found the corpse of an Ancient. He was elated!If I recall... he named it 'Jenova' and was doing a lot of research...One day, he showed up here, looking real distressed.He was mumbling something about Jenova not being an Ancient and that he'd done a terrible thing...He's been missing since then. I heard that he never went back to ShinraSo, if you ever see Professor Gast, I want you to tell him...That the old man that likes to drink in Cosmo Canyon, wanted to hear about the Ancients.Well, there's lots to talk about,but most things about the Ancients are all legend and folk tales, and no one knows the truth."
Elder Bugah,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,...hmm. That's no fun... I wanna tell a story.
Elder Bugah,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"By the way, your friends are all in front of the 'Cosmo Candle'Are you all leaving now?"
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,......
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Cosmo Canyon... This's where AVALANCHE was born...I promised my guys someday... when we saved the planet from the Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate...Biggs... Wedge... Jessie...Now they're all gone... died for the planet....Really? To save the planet?We all... we all hate the Shinra...Do I even got a to go on?Will they......... will they ever forgive me?...Right now, I really don't know. But I know one thing.If there's anything I can do, to save the planet... or the people livin' on it... Then I'm gonna do it!I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I don't care...... let 'em decide for 'emselves."
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,I learned a lot. The elders taught me many things.About the Cetra... And the Promised Land...I'm...... alone... I'm all alone now...
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"But I'm...... we're here for you, right?"
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"I know. I know, but... I am the only...... Cetra."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Does that mean we can't help?
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,......
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Cloud...Bonfires are funny, aren't they?They make you remember all sorts of things.You know, Cloud. 5 Years ago.........It's nothing.No, forget it. I'm afraid to ask..."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,What is it...?
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"It feels like... it feels like you're going far away...You really, really are...... you... right?"
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"What a boring place, just like I thought. I wanna go somewhere! Let's go find some Materia!"
Cait Sith,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"I wonder how many years it's been... Gosh, it brings back memories......"
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"...Long ago....When I was still very small. We were all around this flame...No, never mind..."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,What happened?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"It's about my parents.When I talk about my mother, I am full of pride and joy...And that's fine. ...But when I remember my father, my heart is full of anger..."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,...You really can't forgive your father...?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Of course. He...... left mother for dead.When the Gi tribe attacked, he ran off by himself, leaving mother and the people of the Canyon!"
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"...Come, Nanaki. There's something you should see."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,...?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,The place may be dangerous.Cloud. Will you and one other person come with us?
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,...Where're they going?
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,I wonder what he wants to show Nanaki...?
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Can I go too?
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Does he want to show him THAT? You know, maybe there's some Materia that's been passed on for generations in this Canyon!?"
Cait Sith,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Dangerous? Count me out......
Elder Bugah,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Mmm. I'm starting to feel good now. That bartender's cocktails always hit the spot.
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Hm? If you're looking for Bugenhagen, he went to the Sealed Door.Remember, there's a steel door on the way to Bugenhagen's room.What's that door there for anyhow? It's been closed forever..."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Ho Ho HooooAre we all set?
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,- Yeah- Just a minute
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Not ready yet? Tell me when you are ready.
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Ho Ho Hoooo. Shall we go?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Hey? Aren't you going with us, Grandpa?"
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,What are you crazy? It's dangerous in there. I told you that!You want an old man like me should go first? I'll be right behind you.
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"What is it, you're going back? I'll be waiting here for you when you're ready.I can't leave this door open forever.Good. Then we shall proceed."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Ho Ho Hoooo.Everyone here's a Ghost of the Gi tribe. Killed in a certain battle.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,A certain battle...?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"The vengeful spirits of the Gi didn't disappear, and couldn't return to the Lifestream...We still have far to go. Ho Ho Hoooo."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"As you can see, this cave leads to the back of Cosmo Canyon.It was unfortunate that the Gi were larger than us. If they attacked through here, we wouldn't have stood a chance."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,......
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Let's move on.
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,This warrior went through the cave all alone.Fighting attackers one after another...
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Grandpa...... That warrior...
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Ho Ho Hoooo... We're almost there.
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,What is this......?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Grandpa, is he...!?"
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,After death... The ghosts of the Gi... Like stagnant air......This... can't be!!
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"...Thank you, Cloud. Because of you, we survived.Nanaki, you have grown strong, too."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,......Oh yeah?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Now I know that it wasn't a mistake bringing you here...Come, I have something I want to show you. Right over here."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,This is...
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"...The warrior who fought against the Gi.He kept them from taking even one step into Cosmo Canyon.But he was never able to return to town...Look, Nanaki. Look at your father, at the warrior, Seto."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,...That... That's...... Seto...?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Seto continued to fight the Gi tribe here. ...To protect this Canyon.Even after the Gi's poisonous arrows turned his body to stone......Even after they all ran away... Seto, continued to protect us.And he continues to protect us, even now."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Even now...
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"You thought that he was a coward and ran away. But he, alone risked his life to protect Cosmo Canyon.That is your father, Seto."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,That...... that is Seto? ...!? Did mother know?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Ho Ho Hoooo... She knew. The two of them made me promise to keep this cave shut.They asked me to seal it myself and not to tell a soul.They said we should forget about this cave.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,.........
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Cloud... Would you mind leaving the two of us alone?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Nanaki. I want you to continue your journey with Cloud and the others.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Grandpa!?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Listen, Nanaki.Cloud says they are trying to save the planet.Honestly, I don't think it can be done.For even if they stop every reactor on the planet, it's only going to postpone the inevitable.Even if they stop Sephiroth, everything will perish.But, Nanaki. I've been thinking lately.I've been thinking if there was anything WE could do,as a part of the planet, something to help a planet already in misery...No matter what happens, isn't it important to try?Am I just wishing against fate?I am too old to do anything about it...This year, I'll be 130. Ho Ho Hoooo.That is why, Nanaki, you must go with them! For my sake."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Grandpa...
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,I wanted to show you your real father before you left...I'm so glad that you came back while I was still alive to show you.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Grandpa... don't talk like that. I don't want to think of life... without you......
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Ho Ho Hoooo. Well, I've had a long life."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Grandpa! You must live!I'll see to it.I'll see to what's happening to the planet. And I'll come back to tell you.
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Nanaki...
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"I am  of Cosmo Canyon! The son of the warrior, Seto!I'll come back a warrior true to that noble name! So please, Grandpa..."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,That's... Seto's...... Seto......
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Seto....... Fa... Father...
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,They said they finished fixin' the buggy.
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Shall we get going?
Aeris,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"So this is it, Nanaki..."
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,That's just the way it goes. ...You came in handy at times...
Man,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,The repair on your car is completed.Now you should be able to go where ever you want.
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,- How much do I owe...?- Much obliged
Man,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"No charge! You'd do the same for me, right?"
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"- Please, take 1000 gil- I guess you're right"
Man,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,"Are you sure...? Well, all right. Thank you.Oh yeah. Did you stay at the inn already?There was a bottle on the sofa there a couple of days ago... was it yours?"
Man,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Mmm...... I think the teachings of the 'Study of Planet Life' are true.But can people used to Mako energy ever go back...?
Kid outside Sealed Door,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Nope... It doesn't open... How'd he seal it? With a huge magnet?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Wait for me! I'm coming too!
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Mmm?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Cloud. Please look after Nanaki.
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,What happened?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,I think I grew up a little. That's what happened!
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Nanaki,Ho Ho Hoooo. Come back whenever you need my knowledge.
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What---!!
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...I thought so.
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Then why...? My house is still there too...
Barret,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,The hell's goin' on!? This a dream or somethin'?
Aeris,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...somthing's strange?
Nanaki,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,I wonder what's going on...
Yuffie,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What the...!?
Cait Sith,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Cloud, maybe you were just dreaming...?"
Barret,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"You said the whole town burnt down, right?"
Aeris,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"This is Nibelheim, right? But the town's all here."
Nanaki,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,This is Nibelheim? I heard it burnt down.
Yuffie,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,I heard from someone that this town was gone!
Cait Sith,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,The whole town was destroyed by Sephiroth. At least that's what I heard...
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...Yeah.
Barret,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,You trin' to fool us!?
Aeris,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Hey, what's going on?"
Nanaki,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Cloud... Did you lie to us?
Yuffie,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What happened?
Cait Sith,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Cloud, did you make up your story just to get our support?"
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,I'm not lying!I remember... the intense heat of the flames...
Innkeeper,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Hi, welcome."
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,- Give me a room- What's your story?
Innkeeper,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,It'll be 100 gil a night. Is that all right with you?
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,- Yes- Never mind.
Innkeeper,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Enjoy your stay.
Innkeeper,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Well then, maybe next time..."
Innkeeper,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Sir, don't say such awful things.I was born and raised in this town. What you say never happened."
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,You're lying...
Innkeeper,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"EXUSE ME...... That's so rude...If you're going to talk like that to me, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.Oh, I'm so sorry. I've got lots to do..."
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Man in a Black Cape?He has a tattoo number '6'. Hmm? He has something...
Clone #6,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Urrr...... rrrrr...... rrrgh... must... go... to... Re... uni... on...
Woman,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Nice town, huh?We've been in business here for a long time..."
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...You're lying.
Woman,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Do you have anything to do with this town?
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"- How about bein' born and raised here?- Nope, guess not"
Woman,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,It's not nice to lie!!
Woman,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Oh yeah...?
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,He has a tattoo of the number '12'. Mmm? He has something.
Clone #12,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Can...... you...... hear? The... voice... of... Se... phi... ro... th......
Woman,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What is it?
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,- Nothing- I want to hear your story
Woman,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Oh, really. Then, it'll help me too."
Woman,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Are you sick... saying those things?Get out of here!
Clone #5,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...must...... get...... it... and bring... to... Se... phi... roth...Then... become... one... with... Se... phi... roth...
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,This guy's number '5'...
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,He has a tattoo of the number '11'...
Clone #11,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...must...... go......... Reun... ion...
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Tattoo number '4'
Clone #4,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...Where... are... you...? Great... Se... phi... roth...
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,But... I definitely remember playing the piano then. But why didn't it get burnt down?Play the piano......?
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,I wonder what... this is...
Small Clone,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...Re...... union.
Smaller Clone,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,............ion
Smaller Clone,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,..................

Letter,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"I must get rid of all those that stand in the way of my research. Even that one from the Turks.I scientifically altered him, and put him to sleep in the basement. If you want to find him, then search the area.But... this is merely a game I thought of. It is not necessary for you to participate if you don't want to."
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,There seems to be another letter.- Read it- Ignore it
Letter,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Move the dial on the safe carefully, but quickly. You have 20 seconds. You can not go past the numbers while turning. The 4 hints for the numbers are..."
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,I have a bad feeling about this...- Still open the safe- Don't open
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...To wake me from the nightmare
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",Nibelheim - Reconstructed,You were having a nightmare.
Barret,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,I woke ya up. Ya outta be thankin' me.
Aeris,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,You'll dream about bad things if you sleep in a place like THIS.
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,How bad was your dream?
Nanaki,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...You don't look good.
Yuffie,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Man, you really WERE having a bad dream! Even I feel bad!"
Cait Sith,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Aren't you glad you woke up?
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,The air's pretty heavy here. How can you sleep in a place like this?
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Hmph... a nightmare...? My long sleep has given me time to atone.
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What are you saying?
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What's he talking about...?
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What the hell are you saying?
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out.This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare.
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...you can say that again.
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...That's for sure.
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...It's startin' to look that way!
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Hmm? What do you know?
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",Nibelheim - Reconstructed,- Don't say a thing- Talk about Sephiroth
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare......What? More?"
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"- No, good night- Tell him about Sephiroth"
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Like you said, this mansion is the beginning of a nightmare.No, it's not a dream, it's for real.Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion..."
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Just like you said, this mansion is the start of a nightmare...No, not a dream... it's reality.Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion..."
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"It's like you said, the mansion's the beginning of a nightmare.No, it's not a dream, it's the truth.Sephiroth's gone nuts. He found a ton of secrets hidden in this mansion..."
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Sephiroth!?
"Vincent + Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",Nibelheim - Reconstructed,You know Sephiroth?
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,You start first.
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...That's how it was.
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago? And about the Jenova Project?...He was missing, but has just recently reappeared.He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land."
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Now it's your turn.
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Sorry... I cannot speak.
Barret,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Hey! You lyin' white-faced!
Aeris,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,That's dirty!
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Hmm... I'm disappointed.
Nanaki,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What... you're serious?
Yuffie,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Oh, that's okay. It was probably depressing anyway."
Cait Sith,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Hey, that's not right---"
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Good! I'm not in the mood to hear long stories. Let's get the hell outta here!
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Hearing your stories, has added upon me yet another sin.More nightmares shall come to me now, more than I previously had."
"Cloud, Tifa or Cid",Nibelheim - Reconstructed,- Good night- Who are you?
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"I was with... the Shinra Manufacturing Department in Administrative Research, otherwise known as--the Turks...."
Cloud or Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,The Turks!?
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Turks!?
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Formerly of the Turks.I have no affiliation with Shinra now....And you?
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,", formerly of SOLDIER."
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,", formerly of the AVALANCHE."
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,", formerly of the Space Program Department."
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,You were also with Shinra...? Then do you know Lucrecia?
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Who?
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,......Lucrecia.
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,No idea.
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth.
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...gave birth...?Wasn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
Tifa or Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...gave birth...?Isn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory.He was born from a beautiful lady.That lady was Lucrecia.She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. Beautiful... Lucrecia."
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...A human experiment?
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"There was no way to cancel the experiment.I couldn't stop her.That was my sin.I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst."
Barret,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,That why you started sleepin' in a box? Gimme a break!
Aeris,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,So your punishment was to sleep? That's... kinda weird.
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,So the punishment was sleep? That's weird.
Nanaki,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,So you slept as punishment? Isn't that strange? That thinking...
Yuffie,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,OK. Boring story no. 1.
Cait Sith,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,You think that's punishing yourself? You're just sleeping.
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,You shouldn't sleep just because of that. Sleep?
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Let me sleep...
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Wait!If I go with you will I meet Hojo?
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Dunno. But we're after him and Sephiroth. So, I guess sooner or later..."
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Hmm, I don't know. But we're going after Hojo and Sephiroth. So, we might......"
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,I dunno. But we're going after him and Sephiroth. So there's a good chance...
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Lucrecia...All right. I've decided to go with you.
Barret,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"W, what?"
Aeris,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Sure is a quick change of heart. Huh?
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What? You're coming with us?
Nanaki,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What?
Yuffie,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Huh? Oh great just what I needed...
Cait Sith,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,What?
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Hey, hold on sleepy. You're pretty damn pushy!"
Vincent,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Being a former Turks, I may be of help to you..."
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"All right, then."
Tifa,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"All right, I understand."
Cid,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Alright then.
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Sephiroth!
Sephiroth,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Being here brings back memories.Are you going to participate in the Reunion?
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,I don't even know what a Reunion is!
Sephiroth,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,Jenova will be at the Reunion. Jenova will join the Reunion becoming a calamity from the skies.
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,"Jenova, a calamity from the skies? You mean she wasn't an Ancient!?"
Sephiroth,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...I see. I don't think you have the right to participate.I will go North past Mt. Nibel. If you wish to find out... then follow...
Cloud,Nibelheim - Reconstructed,...Reunion? Calamity from the skies?

Innkeeper,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Well then, come by again sometime."
Innkeeper,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Excuse me. Please don't come in here.Our books and the room keys are in here, so I'll have to ask you to please stay out."
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,The books...Maybe we could find out who's been here?- Was there a man in a Black Cape?- Not interested
Innkeeper,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"A man with a Black Cape? No, no one like that has ever stayed here."
Innkeeper,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Look, we're all adults here, So I'd appreciate it if you used some discretion."
Barkeeper,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Would you like something to drink?
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,- Let me hear your story- Not interested
Barkeeper,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Did you meet the Captain already? He's really the town's representative, so you should really talk with him."
Barkeeper,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"......that's too bad. Please come again.If he keeps up like that, he's gonna collapse someday. Y'know what I mean? I'm talkin' heart attack."
Man at Table,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Better ask the Captain about this town. He's the one in charge of it.
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,- Captain?- Did you see a man in a Black Cape?
Man at Table,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in their Space Program.He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an accident...Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming about going into outer space."
Man at Table,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,A man in a Black Cape? Nope... don't know a thing about it.
Man at Table,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,A drink will ease your heart...
Man in Bathroom,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"...I'm in here.P...... Urrrrgh... aaaaaghh...Urrrrgh, urrrgh"
Redhead,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,That rusted out rocket is all that remains of the Shinra's Space Program.
Mechanic,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Everyone in this town was a mechanic back when they were planning to launch the rocket.
Man,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Mmm, I'm so bored. Isn't there anything that can get me excited?"
Woman,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Geeeeez, it's boring! Isn't anything exciting going to happen here?"
Old Man outside Item Shop,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"This used to be a Shinra base where they used to launch rockets.You saw the leaning rocket, right? That's Shinra No. 26. It never got off the ground though.It just looms there. That's how the town got its name... 'Shinra No. 26'.Want to look at the rocket with me?"
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"- Yeah, let's take a look- No, not interested"
Old Man,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"I get so impressed every time I look at it.Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby.But, out of appreciation, let me give you this."
Old Man,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I wish you'd take care of it and use it...
Old Man,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Oh, how boring..."
Item Shopkeeper,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Welcome! This is the Item Shop.

Old Man,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"My job's to make everyone laugh all over the world...Hmm, let's see... do I know any good jokes...?"
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,There's a Shinra logo on it. Tiny Bronco...... This is cool.
Barret,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,The Shinra always keep the most useful things to themselves. Let's steal it!
Aeris,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Let's take it? OK, Cloud!"
Tifa,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I wonder if we can borrow it...
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Will it fly? Is it all right to just take it?
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Cloud, let's steal it! I love stealing from the Shinra!"
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Cloud! If we steal it, we'll get in deep trouble!"
Vincent,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,...Want me to keep watch?
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Um... may I help you?
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,No... We're just looking at it.
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"...If you would like to use it, please ask the Captain. The Captain should be in the Rocket.I'm . And what are your names?"
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I'm .
Barret,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"I'm , of AVALANCHE."
Aeris,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I'm .

Nanaki,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,", otherwise known as Red XIII."
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I'm !
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Fortune telling machine , here."
Vincent,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,. My occupation is...... forget it.
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Hmm... So you're not with the Shinra.I thought the approval for the reopening of the Space Program came.
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,......!?
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,President Rufus is scheduled to come here. The Captain's been so restless all morning.
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Rufus!!?
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,What're you guys doin' here?
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,We heard the Captain was here.
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Captain? I'm the Captain!The name's . Everyone calls me 'Captain', though.What d'ya want?"
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"- Tell me about this rocket- Is Rufus coming?- Can we borrow the ""Tiny Bronco""?"
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Wow! Not bad for a kid.Alright then, I'll explain it to you.You know Shinra developed a lot of technological gadgets during the meaningless war, right?Now it's a Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons manufacturer.Well, they came up with a Rocket Engine.There was so much excitement about the thought of going into outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger.They put a major budget into it and made prototype after prototype! Finally, they completed the Shinra No. 26.They chose the best pilot in Shinra--no, in the world--me. I mean, come on.And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was goin' well..."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Ummm... Just look around...
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Yeah! It must be news about restarting the Space Program.A young President, that's what we needed! He still has dreams, too!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,You out of your *&$^$# mind!? That's my most cherished possession. I can't let you take it.
Barkeeper,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Would you like something to drink?
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,- Let me hear your story
Barkeeper,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Cid's had some bad breaks. It's really no one's fault he couldn't go into space.Just bad luck, I guess..."
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Excuse me... Cloud?Did the Captain say anything?
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Nope...
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Oh...?
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"^%$#! Shera. What are you, blind!?We got guests!! GET SOME TEA! ^%$#!"
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I... I'm sorry.

Barret,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"...damn, man. Wassup with that guy's attitude?"
Aeris,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Sheesh...!! What bad manners!
Tifa,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Poor Shera.
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Who does he think he is......?
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Man, this sucks...!"
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Man, he sure seems wound up tight."
Vincent,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,............
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Sorry. It's our fault.
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"No, no. He's always like this."
Barret,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,He always like this? That's pretty bad!
Aeris,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Is it like this all the time? You keep quiet even when he's like that to you?
Tifa,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Is it always like this...? Why is Cid so hard on you?
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I think it's a bit too harsh.
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,What's his prob!? I'm gonna go clean that guy's clock!!
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Is he like this all the time...? Bitin' your head off like that? I could never stand it...
Vincent,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,...It's amazing that you can live with it.
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,No... It's because of my stupid mistake.I was the one who destroyed his dream...
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,What happened?
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,(laughing)Hey! Get your ass in gear! You work like a snail!Even the moon'd get tired waitin' around for your ass!
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I'm... I'm sorry.
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Don't take so much time checkin' that *%$^# oxygen tank!Shera, bein' careful's good, but it won't do any good, no matter how many times you check that oxygen tank.That thing wouldn't break even if hell froze over."
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,But...
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"No buts!!You're not stupid, so be more efficient!"
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I'm sorry......
Men,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Captain! Our dreams are finally coming true!We are so proud to be a part of the launch of Shinra No. 26.Captain, preparations are complete! All that's left is lift off!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Yeah! Leave it all to me! I'll be back in a few!
Men,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"All right, Captain! Fly our dreams into outer space!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Thanks, guys!"

Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Instrument panel... all clear. Shinra No. 26, ready for launch."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,......finally.
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,What the? What happened!?
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,What!? Who is the little ^%$@!?
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Hey goddammit!! Who the &%$#'s still in there?
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"It's , Captain. Don't mind me, go ahead with the launch."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Shera!? What are you still doin' in there!?
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I was still concerned. The results of the oxygen tank test weren't satisfactory.
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"You stupid little ^$#^%!It's gonna get so hot in there that there ain't gonna be SHIT left when we blast off!You're gonna be burnt to a crisp! You're gonna die! You know that, doncha!?"
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"I don't mind.If I can just fix this, the launch will be a success. I'm almost done."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Almost done!? You're gonna die!
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"GODDAMNIT, Shera... you wanna make me a murderer?"
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Captain!
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Shera!?
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Tank Number 7 check is complete. Once I complete Tank Number 8, it's all clear."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Come on, Shera... hurry up... You're gonna die..."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,What... what am I....... What am I supposed to do...?
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Oh man, the moon... outer space... my dreams..."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,SH---------------IT!!
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"He pushed the Emergency Engine Shut Down switch, aborting the mission, to save my life.After that, the Space Program was cut back and the launch was canceled.It's my fault his dream was destroyed...That's why... it's all right. I don't care what the Captain says, I'll live my life for him."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Shera! You still haven't served 'em tea!
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I... I'm sorry.
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Hurry up and sit down! Or ain't my hospitality good enough for you!?They're late... Where is Rufus...?
Palmer,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Hey-HEY! Long time no see! So Cid, how ya been?"
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Well, if it ain't fat man, Palmer. How long were you figurin' on keepin' me waitin'!?"
Palmer,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Hey-hey! I don't know. The President's outside, so why don't you ask him?"
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"^$#&! Good for nothing, fat &$#$^@!"
Palmer,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Don't say 'fat'!Hey-hey! Tea!Can I have some too? With lotsa sugar and honey and... oh yeah, don't forget the lard!"
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Is President Rufus here to announce that he's going to restart the Space Program?
Palmer,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Hey-hey? Have we met before?Hey-hey! Is the tea ready yet?With plenty of sugar and honey. Oh yeah, and don't forget the lard too."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"What the......! You got me all excited for nothing!?Then, what'd you come here for?"
Rufus,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco.We're going after Sephiroth. But seems like we've been going in the wrong direction.But now, we think we know where he's headed. But, we have to cross the ocean. That's why we want your plane..."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"&^#^%! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny Bronco.Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take the sky away from me too!?"
Rufus,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Oh my...You seem to forget it was because of Shinra, Inc. that you were able to fly in the first place."
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,What!?
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"(from behind Cloud)Uh, excuse me...This way..."
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"You wanted to use the Tiny Bronco, right?"
Shera,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I believe Palmer's going to take it. Why don't you talk to him?
Palmer,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Hmm... Why do I have to do this...? I'm the head of the Space Program...
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,We'll be takin' that Tiny Bronco.
Palmer,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I've seen you somewhere before...I know! The Shinra building! When the President was killed! Ulp!Se... se... security!!
Palmer,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Heh-hic-heh-hic!Heh heh hic!
Barret,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,It won't stop!
Aeris,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,It won't stop!
Tifa,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,It won't stop!
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,It's going to take off.
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,No!! It's gonna take off!
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,No! It's going to take off!
Vincent,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,It's not going to stop...
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Forget it! Get in!!
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Shit!! The tail's been hit!
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Emergency landing...
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,This's gonna be a big splash. Hold on to your drawers and don't piss in 'em!
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,She won't fly anymore...
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Can't we use it as a boat?
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,$#&%! Do whatever you want!
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Cid, what are you going to do now?"
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Dunno. I'm history with the Shinra and I've given up on the town.
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,How 'bout your wife? How 'bout Shera?
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Wife? Don't make me laugh! Just thinkin' 'bout marryin' her gives me the chills.What're you guys gonna do?
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,We're going after a man named Sephiroth. We'll have to get Rufus of the Shinra someday too.
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"I don't know about any of that, but...What the hell!? Sign me up!"
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"How 'bout it, everyone?"
Barret,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I don't care.
Aeris,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I'm all for it.
Tifa,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Of course, no problem!"
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I don't really care.
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Whatever!
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,I don't mind.
Vincent,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,...Do whatever you like.
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Glad to be aboard, numbskulls!"
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Numskulls...?
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,"Yeah. Anyone stupid enough to go up against Shinra nowadays, has GOTTA be a numskull! I like it!So, where we headed?Rufus was goin' after Sephiroth towards the Temple of the Ancients."
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Really!? ...Where is it? That Temple of the Ancients?
Cid,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Dunno. That numskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'The wrong direction'... so maybe it's off this way?
Cloud,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,Let's just head for land and get some information. Temple of the Ancients... that name bothers me.
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Meeting Cid,".........Hm. How 'bout goin' west?No, no reason. NO reason at all!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wait, wait, wait, wai----t!!"
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"What!? The hell happened, all of a sudden!?"
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"What!? What happened, all of a sudden?"
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What the--? Did something happen?
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What happened all of a sudden!? Don't scare me like that!
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wh, wh, what is it, all of a sudden!? Don't scare me like that!"
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What happened all of a sudden? Did something happen?
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What the HELL is it! Shoutin' out and jumpin' in front of me all of a sudden!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I know this area pretty well.It gets pretty tough past here. Better get ready...
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"...Hah, I know what you're thinkin'. And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!?"
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"......Hmmm...... Something's fishy...You're not planning something sneaky again, are you?"
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"...Really? Somehow,...I don't believe it.Are you trying to con us again...?"
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hmm...... Smells fishy.You're not going to trick us again...?
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"You serious? I can't trust a person like you.But, I guess I'm not one to talk."
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Further down? I don't see any signs of danger...Also, there's something unnatural in the way Yuffie's acting..."
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hey! You, serious?If you're trying to con us, you won't get away with it!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,No! It's REALLY tough...
Soldiers,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"There they are, catch 'em!!"
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Shinra!?
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Shinra!?
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"What, the Shinra!?"
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,The Shinra!!
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hey, the Shinra......!?"
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,It's Shinra!!
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,That's Sh... Shinra's......
Shinra Soldier,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hey, that's not them! These are the other guys from before!!"
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Yuffie, so you're...!"
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Yuffie, did you by any chance..."
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Yuffie, you're not......!"
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"So you were, Yuffie...!!"
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Not bad, Yuffie, not bad at all."
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,So what does this mean... You will explain this later...
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Yuffie! You sure got some nerve, kid!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I didn't know! I have nothing to do with this one!
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Whaddya mean 'this one'!? 'This one'!So you WERE plannin' somethin'!!
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'?So you WERE up to something bad!
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,This one? Did you just say 'THIS one'?So you WERE trying to pull something off!
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What do you mean 'this one' 'THIS one'!So you were concocting some evil scheme!!
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'?So you had something else that you're planning to trick us with!
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"What do you mean, 'This one'?You had something else in mind?"
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Whaddya mean 'THIS one'! 'THIS one'!So you WERE planning some crooked $%*&!!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"No, umm, uh......"
Shinra Soldiers,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What should we do!?Uh...... Get them! Grab them and ask questions later!!
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,The hell's goin' on!?I knew somethin' was missing. All my materia's gone!!
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What's going on!?I thought something was missing... my materia's all gone!!
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"What's going on!?I thought something was fishy... My, my materia is missing!!"
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"What's going on?I thought something was funny, my materia, disappeared!!"
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"What's going on!?Something's missing, and it's my materia-it's all gone!!"
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I thought something was wrong, So that's it.Look, my materia's been stolen..."
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What the hell's goin' on!I knew I was missing something... My materia's gone!!
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hey, we gotta problem! Our materia's all gone!!"
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,O... OH NO! All of our materia... gone!?
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hey... where's Yuffie...?
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hey... where's Yuffie...?
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Yo... where's that $#@^% Yuffie...?
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hey... where's Yuffie...?
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hey... where's Yuffie...?
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Now... where's Yuffie...?
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Ey... where the hell's that damn kid...?
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"That &*&$ kid!!!Grrrrrgh!! Arrrrrgh Uhhhhhhhhhhhh!!She was after our materia from the start!!She went North! When I get my hand on her, I'll get our materia back!C'mon! We're goin' after her!"
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I'm so------ mad!!She was probably eyeing our materia from the beginning.Seems like she headed North. Let's hurry after her and get our materia back!
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,She's done it to us again!!I'm never gonna forgive her!She was after our materia from the beginning.I won't let her get away with it! I'm pretty sure she ran off North. Let's go after her!!
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"ZOUNDS!!Grrrrrrrrrgh...... Grrrgh! Grrrrrrgh!!Her objective was stealing our materia from the beginning....sniff... North! She ran off to the North!I'm not going to let her get away with this! Hurry, hurry! We have to get our materia back!"
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"She's done it again!She sure took us for fools!She must've been after our materia from the beginning.We can't just let her get away, right? Then, let's hurry after her! Which way? It's North, the North! It's a message from the stars!"
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Inexcusable...Seems as though all that she was after was our materia.We can't just let her get away. She ran off...... to the North...We must go after her and retrieve our materia back.
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,That little ^%#^$@!!Takin' me for a fool!!No doubt about it! That kid was after my materia from the start!!Hmm... Seems like she went North.Don't be draggin' your asses! We're going right NOW! That $#@^ is history!!
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"...First, I gotta do something about her."
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I can't just leave it there...
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Damn kid! I'll get her no matter what!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hey!!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,This is MY house! Nobody gets in!
Man on the Path to Godo's House,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Lord Godo is in this house.He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep......What, Yuffie... It's best to ask Lord Godo about that.But today he's not in the best of... Well, I should say... But really he's not so......
In the Weapons shop...
Weapons ShopkeeperSorry, listen I... No, nothing... never mind.
ManSorry, but we're entirely sold out now.What's this here? Ah, no... that's uh......a sample! Yeah, that's it... a sample. Sorry, but why don't you all come back later?
The local pub, Turtle's Paradise... Outside is a flyer.
Pub [Turtle's Paradise] Publicity Flyers! Notice[Turtle's Paradise] is now having a Publicity flyer campaign.They will be posted all over the world. So make sure you look for our flyers that say ""Turtle's Paradise""There's six in all. If you find them all, make sure to let the owner of Turtle's Paradise know.

BarkeeperHey, hey, welcome! You on a trip? Well, just relax and make yourself at home.Nowadays, thanks to tourism, Wutai's able to get by.
ManHey. Did you hear? There used to be a Water God here in Wutai.They say the Water God was a huge snake!Now we live in a world filled with Mako. Not many people would believe in something like that now.But some in the world, and here in Wutai, still believe.Believe in the scales of the Water God and in materia that has its power in it.
Cloud walks up to the Turks - Reno, Rude, and Elena - who are drinking at a table.
ElenaYy, you!? How did you get here...?
She jumps up.
Never mind that. I guess it's fate that brought us together.Get ready to die!!
Cloud and the others ready their weapons. Reno and Rude don't move.
Reno...Elena, you talk too much.
ElenaWw, what?
RenoWhat are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?
ElenaWe're taking our vacation and resting up from our work.
RenoNow our vacation is ruined.
ElenaB, but...
Rude...even the booze tastes bad now.
Elena...sorry...
She sits back down, and Cloud relaxes.
ElenaHmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight!The next time we meet I won't be so nice.
RenoDrink, Rude! How long have we been a team...?There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm glad I did it.I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you.
RudeTo the Turks... To Reno... cheers!
Outside the Item Shop, a little kid is running around.
Little KidAlright, alright, alright! I know!On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!A girl with materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing Da-chao for some time now.You know I've noticed that there's  pounding noise from time to time in this store.
Lord Godo is in this house.He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep......Anyhow, for some reason Yuffie's had a fondness for materia ever since I can remember.She's always hung around places she thought might have it.
In the Item Shop...
Item ShopkeeperWe got a lot of different stuff here. Take what you want.
WomanI'm sorry. The sign outside says ""Materia"", but there's almost no materia left anywhere in Wutai.Listen, this is just a backwoods town. We don't have much to do with Shinra, and besides...If we had a lot of materia, Wutai would be a much more exciting town, but we don't...
Cloud opens the nearby treasure chest.
Received ""MP Absorb"" Materia!
Yuffie jumps down from above.
Stole ""MP Absorb"" Materia!
WomanHuh? What? You DID?
Cloud continues up the path towards Godo's house.
Man outside Godo's HouseThat five-storied pagoda over there is called the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods...The Five Gods are Power, Speed, Magic, War and Omni, who has the best characteristics of everything.Since ancient times, we in Wutai, have worshipped Da-chao and the Water God.Legend has it that the village has been protected by Da-chao, the Water God, and the Five Mighty Gods.But in the last battle, we didn't fare so well... I guess our beliefs were based on nothing more than legends.
Inside the pagoda...
Gorky...
If Cloud tries to run upstairs...
GorkyFreeze!You aren't from Wutai, are you?
Cloud- No- Yes

No
GorkyOnly those from Wutai are allowed in the tower!I'll have to ask for you to leave!


Yes
GorkyHey! I hate people who lie about their identities! Leave this tower at once!

Inside Godo's house, they find Godo lying on a futon.
GodoGOOGAH... what do you want?Don't have... GAH... anything much but, you should be able to... GOO... rest yourselves here. GOGAH... make yourselves at home.......Yuffie? ......nope, never heard of her. ...GOOGO......you again? I told you once, and I'm telling you again, I don't know her.
He sits up.
Listen, I said I didn't know her! There isn't anyone named Yuffie here in Wutai!
He gets to his feet and turns to face Cloud.
...never seen you around here before...Lately I've been seeing a lot of Shinra soldiers around here... You wouldn't have anything to do with that would you?I don't care about who you are.But if you're in trouble with the Shinra, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.I don't want the Shinra hanging around here looking over my shoulder.
YuffieWhat's with you, you coward!
She jumps down from the ceiling to stand in his doorway.
GodoYuffie......!
YuffieYou scared of the Shinra?Then why don't you fall into line and obey them, just like all of the other towns!
She runs into the room.
Those guys are the ones who are really fighting the Shinra!
GodoShut up! What would you know about this?
YuffieYou get beaten once, and then that's it?What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?
GodoNo kid like you's going to talk to me like that!You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
YuffieThat's my style! And it's my own business, not yours! Don't you try and dictate what I should do!
GodoStyle...? Dictate...?Throwin' around all those fancy words... You're a miserable daughter!
YuffieHmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!!
She runs out and into the shrine down the hall. Godo starts to chase after her, but gives up and returns to his room.
Godo......take your things and get out of here now.To protect Wutai, we cannot afford to stand up to Shinra.
She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.Like father like daughter...Yuffie's like that, you know. Sometimes she'll just bust into people's houses.Then she hides in the shadows... Just like a little kid.
Woman Walking near RiverLife is just like the flowing of a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it.Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see.Yuffie? I saw her a while ago. She must be in one of the houses around here.
At the old man's house...
BoyOh no! More weirdosNo, these aren't like the one from a while ago, but these ones look weird too!
Old ManWell, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see... what was your name?
BoyNo, Gramps! This isn't anyone you know! This is just some stranger who barged into our house!What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl came in here a minute ago and I...
Cloud pushes aside a screen to reveal Yuffie hiding behind it.
Yuffie......
She dashes out of the house.
Old ManOh, how exciting. You a friend of my grandson's?
BoyNo, Gramps! These guy's are creepy! They're runnin' all over the place!
She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.Like father like daughter...That reminds me, Lately I've been seeing a kid around here that reminds me of Yuffie.Always sneakin' around corners And into somethin' she shouldn't be.
If Cloud tries to leave Wutai...

BarretWait, that damn Yuffie's still gotta be somewhere in this cheap town! Or you all jes' gonna go on?
AerisI don't think she came out from here... Is that ok?
TifaKnowing Yuffie, she's still hidden somewhere in town. You sure?
NanakiI know she hasn't left town! You still want to leave?
VincentShe couldn't have left town... I think she is must still be here... Or do you want to go on?
CidYou lettin' that damn kid off the hook? I know she's gotta be in this town somewhere!

Outside the Turtle's Paradise, there is a barrel that's wiggling. Cloud and the others position themselves near the escape routes and then open it. Yuffie jumps out and tries to get away, but finds herself surrounded.

CloudYou can't get away, Yuffie.
TifaGive it up, Yuffie!
CidYou lost, Yuffie.

YuffieO... ok, I know... I was wrong......You win. I'll give you back your materia...
She leads them to her house, just as two Shinra soldiers run into Turtle's Paradise.

Shinra SoldierSo our reports were right! He IS here on vacation!We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up!
Reno...what a drag.
Shinra SoldierWh, what was that...?
RenoRight now we're off duty and can't run off to save your butts.
Shinra SoldierWe know you're off duty, but...
RenoIf you knew that, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' me sober.
Shinra SoldierBut you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too!
There is a pause. Reno says nothing.
Shinra SoldierAll right, that's it! We'll get him without any help from the Turks, just you see!
The two soldiers run out. One comes back momentarily.
Shinra SoldierAnd don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about this!!
He leaves again.
ElenaReno, do you think that was really such a good idea!?I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk would act!?
RenoElena. Don't misunderstand.A pro isn't someone who sacrifices himself for his job. That's just a fool.
ElenaRude...?
Rude.........
ElenaWell, I don't buy that! Goodbye!!
She runs out.
Rude.........
RenoRelax. She's not a child. Let her have her way now...

At Yuffie's house...
YuffieI know, the materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. ...Follow me.
She leads them down to the basement, a training room.
Flyer on Wall[Turtle's Paradise] No. 6Drink at the ""Turtle's Paradise"" And talk about Wutai!You'll know ""Turtle's Paradise"" by the big pot outside!!
Yuffie...I've been hearing that ever since I was little.Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more important...You saw what it looks like now, right? ...JUST a resort town...After we lost the war, we got peace, but with that, we lost something else. Now look at Wutai...That's why... if I had lots of materia I could...
She starts crying.

CloudListen, Yuffie. I don't care about the history of Wutai or your feelings.You've got our materia and I want it back... now.If you give it back now, we'll drop the whole thing.
TifaI'm sorry, Yuffie. I know how you feel, but we need materia too....We just can't let you have it. Please understand.
Cid......Dammit, Yuffie. We ain't got time to be listening to your life story.If you want materia, get it yourself. That's how you should do it.

YuffieI know. I know that...That... sniff... switch... the lever on the left...... materia's... sniff, hic... in there.
BarretAin't nuthin' we can do about it...
AerisI feel bad, but......
TifaNow, the Materia...
NanakiWere we a little too harsh on her?
Cait SithWell, let's get our materia back.
VincentThere was nothing else to do.
CidHmmph... I dunno......
Cloud- Flip the Left Lever- Flip the Right Lever
Regardless of which lever he pulls, a cage comes down atop the party members.

BarretWh...what the hell is this!?
AerisEyaaaaah
TifaEyaaaaah
NanakiWh, what are you doing!?
Cait SithWh, what is this!?
Vincent!?
CidWhoa!?

YuffieHa ha ha------! Never trust anyone that easily!! / Ha ha------! You should've listened!!The Materia's mine! Tough!You want your materia? Then go find it yourself!Yeah that's right. And when you're looking for the materia, remember you gotta steel it.Heh heh... steel... steel! Get it?C ya!!
She runs off. If Cloud tries to run after her without helping the others...

BarretY, yo, wait up!!
AerisWait, don't leave us!
TifaW...wait don't leave us here!
NanakiHelp us first!
Cait SithHey help us...please!
VincentWait, don't go by yourself!
CidHey! Help me first!

Cloud frees the others from the cage and they go looking for her.At the Turtle's Paradise...
BarkeeperSeems like the town got really boisterous since you arrived. Did anything happen?
If you have now obtained all 6 Turtles Paradise flyers...
BarkeeperCongrats! You have just found all six flyers for the ""Turtles Paradise""!How wonderful! Now here is your prize, just as we promised!!
Received ""Power Source""!eceived ""Guard Source""!Received ""Magic Source""!Received ""Mind Source""!Received ""Speed Source""!Received ""Luck Source""!Received ""Megalixir""!
BarkeeperPlease come again to ""Turtles Paradise""! We're looking forward to seeing you!
Reno......It's just that we're off duty!I don't feel like drinking with you. And don't talk to me.
Rude.........
Cloud goes to the bell near Godo's house to find the gate open. When he rings the bell, a hidden door opens. Going inside, he finds Yuffie being abducted by a man in black.
YuffieLet go! I SAID let GO!Hey! Who do you think I...... OW! What're you doin'...? Jerk!

CloudYou......!
TifaOh! You're......!
CidWw, who are you!?

Corneo......ho..... ...............ho.........Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!

CloudCorneo!?
TifaDon Corneo!?
CidThe hell are you doing!

CorneoHohi!I've finally got a new chicky!Two for one, in fact! Hohi, hohi!
Cloud, Tifa, or CidTwo!?
ElenaH......hey! Let go of me! You're gonna regret this!!
CorneoHohi, hohi! Hohihi!
Corneo and his lackeys run off. If Cloud leaves and enters Godo's house from the front, he finds two Shinra soldiers blocking the way into the shrine.
Shinra SoldierNow listen up! They must be in the area! Find them no matter what!
Shinra SoldierYes, sir!!
On following Corneo up from the hidden room into the shrine, three Shinra soldiers cut Corneo off.
Shinra SoldierThere he is! It's Corneo! Don't let him get away!Attaaaack!
Corneo runs to the side, and the soldiers attack Cloud and the others instead. Back outside Godo's house, they find Reno and Rude.
RenoHmm... that Corneo is good at escaping...
Rude......Elena.
RenoLet's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can do.
Rude nods and runs off.
Reno......Sounded pretty good.
He turns to Cloud.
If Elena is in his hands, that's going to make things a little difficult.And uh...

Cloud......Ok. Corneo took Yuffie from us.And without Yuffie, there's no way we'll get our materia back.
Tifa......all right. Corneo stole Yuffie from us, as well.And without her, there's no way we'll get our materia back.
Cid......that's just beautiful! And now that *#$^@'s walked off with Yuffie, too!And without that brat, we can't get our hands on our materia!

RenoDon't misunderstand.We have no intention of joining you. But for now, we'll agree not to bother each other. That's all.

CloudThat's fine. We have absolutely no intention of cooperating with the Turks either.Now, uh, just what direction did Corneo run off to?
TifaThe same goes for us. We don't want to be friendly with the Turks.Now which direction did Corneo run off in?
CidOf course! There ain't no way we'd wanna join up with the Turks anyway!Anyhow, which direction did that %^$*& run off in?

RenoHmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the place that stands out the most.
Reno runs off.
Two girls just went off towards Da-chao. I wonder if that place is starting to become popular with the kids?One had herself all tangled up in a rope. And the other one kind of looked like Yuffie.
Little KidAlright, alright, alright! I saw an old man in flashy clothes running towards Da-chao!He was babblin' somethin' and looked like he could float! It almost bowled me over!
Cloud arrives at Da-chao.
RenoYou're finally here. We're gonna split into two.You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena.Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, Yuffie.For now...
Following Reno up the mountain...
RenoDon't fool around. You know the enemy's not gonna wait for us, right?
Following Rude, they find him outside the fire caves...
Rude......
If Cloud tries to proceed through the fire caves...

CloudWhoa!!Can't go through here... That flame would make crispy critters of us in an instant.
TifaEyaaaah!There is no way past this!
CidDamn, that's hot!I like hot baths, but this is TOO hot!

In the end they find Corneo holding Yuffie and Elena tied to the face of a statue, observing them from the palm of the statue's hand.
YuffieLET... ME...... GO!!!!
CorneoHmm! Delicious... scrumptious! I think I've just found a new HOBBY!Which shall it be? Hmm... Hmm...Should I go... with HER?
ElenaHe... hey, I'm one of the 'Turks'! Don't think you can get away with this!?
CorneoOr... maybe... HER?
YuffieOh GAWD! If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've taken rope escape lessons more seriously!!
CorneoHmm!!! I've made my choice! My companion for the night will be.........the cheerful one!
YuffieGROSS-NESS!Don't mess with me old man! You don't even have any Materia!
CorneoOooooh! And she's saucy, too! Wheee! Wheee!

CloudAll right, that's it!!
TifaHold it right there!
CidHey, hey, hey! That's as far as you go!

CorneoHee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?
Cloud and the others run in.
YuffieOh man! Cloud......!
Or, if Tifa:
Oh man! Tifa......!
Or, if Cid:
Oh man! That old fart, Cid......!
CorneoWheeel... long time no see.
CloudDon't tell me you forgot...

BarretYou damn Midgar hyena...!
AerisYou just don't get it, do you...!?
TifaThat fall into the trap really hurt!
NanakiHurry and let the two go!
Cait SithListen you stupid, slimy, sleazy old scab bag! If you want to get women, there's such a thing as the RIGHT way!
VincentI don't care what you're doing, so much as the idiotic way you're doing it...
CidMaybe God'd forgive an ugly ^#@# like you, but I won't!

CorneoBe quiet! None of you know how much I've suffered since then...It's a long story, but......

CloudI don't really care! Let Yuffie and Elena go!
TifaWe don't want to hear it! Just let the two go!
CidI don't really give a damn! You're gonna let the two girls go, or else I'm gonna break your arm!

CorneoHmm... You guys are... serious. ......Good, good....this ain't no time for me to be fooling around either...Why did you kill my little Aps?I'm gonna make you PLAY with my new pet, so you won't get in the way of my search for a bride!RAPPS---come here!!
Cloud and the others fight and defeat Rapps.
CorneoWait...Just wait a second!

CloudSHUT UP!
TifaYou better say your prayers!
CidDon't be such a poor loser, old man!

CorneoJust listen to me - it won't take long.Why do you think a bad guy like me would swallow his pride and plead for his life?
Cloud, Tifa, or Cid- 1 Because he's ready to die- 2 Because he's sure to win- 3 Because he's clueless

1 Because he's ready to die
CorneoHmm...! WRONG...!


2 Because he's sure to win
CorneoHmm...! RIGHT!


3 Because he's clueless
CorneoHmm...! Close, but no cigar...!

Corneo pushes a button and Elena and Yuffie flip upside down.
ElenaEyaaaah...!
YuffieMakes me so MAD...!
CorneoIf I push this button, they'll fall upside down, and we'll have a SQUASHED TOMATOES!
CloudDamn...!

BarretDamn dirty-playin' $#%@&T$*^%$!
AerisAll right...
TifaCoward!
NanakiGrrrrrgh...!
Cait SithYou sure are vulgar!
Vincent......!
CidSo this is how a loser lives...!

CorneoNow, give me your women too!Ha, ha, ha, ha! I guess I'm the one laughing last!
RenoNo, that would be us.
CorneoHee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?
Enter Reno.
Corneo...The Turks!
RenoYou knew this was gonna happen ever since you leaked that secret.We're going to take care of you... personally.
CorneoDAMMIT! Then they're all goin' with me!
Rude runs in from behind and throws something at Corneo, who falls to the edge of the hand.
CorneoUgh...!
RenoGood timing, Rude.
Rude...Let's get to work.
Reno walks over to Corneo and steps on his fingers.
RenoAll right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up.Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with those guys to get you...?1. Because we were ready to die2. Because we were sure of victory3. Because we were clueless
CorneoTwo... Number two?
RenoAll wrong.
He grinds his foot into Corneo's hand.
CorneoNo...! Wait, sto......!
He loses his grip and falls.
Aaaaaaaaaa......p
RenoThe correct answer was...
Rude...because it's our job.
ElenaOh, thank you very much...!I never expected you'd to come help......
RenoElena, don't act so weak.You're a Turks!
ElenaY... Yes, sir!

BarretNever thought you'd come an' help us...
AerisThanks for your help.
TifaTh... Thanks.
NanakiI'll just say you... helped.
Cait SithYou guys have some good in you.
VincentIt would appear thanks are in order...
CidI guess, thanks for today.

Rude......
Reno's cell phone rings, and he answers it.
RenoYes... this is Reno.Yes... Yes... I'll get on it right away.
ElenaWas that the company?
RenoYeah, they want us to find Cloud...
Cloud and the others ready their weapons.
RudeAre we on...?
RenoNo, today we're off duty.
YuffieHey---who cares about that!? Get----me-----down----!
Back at Yuffie's house. She darts around putting the materia back in its slots.
YuffiePhew, perfect. Now the materia is back in its rightful place.

CloudHey... the placement of it is all messed up.
TifaHey, what is this...? The placement of it's all messed up!
CidWhat the hell's goin' on!? The placement of the materia's all messed up!

YuffieHuh? Oh, it'll be all right...Don't be so picky!Anyways, that sure was close......No, normally I would kick their butts, Boom, Bang!!
She shakes her fist and turns away.
That Corneo guy's a real pain.
Behind her back, Cloud and the others exchange looks.
YuffieI'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy.
Cloud and the others walk out.
YuffieOh, by the way, some of those guys from the Turks are good, huh?At least, after all that, we got the materia back.Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey...
She turns around to notice they've gone.
......Hey!! W...... Wait!Oh, all right. Here, I'll give this to you guys.
She runs into her room to grab something and comes back out.
Here, look, look!
Received ""MP Absorb"" Materia!
Yuffie.........Come on, wait---!
She runs out after them.
No matter what anyone says, I'm going with you!...next time......

After everything has died down, they can go back to Wutai so Yuffie can climb the pagoda.
Woman Walking near RiverMateria is like Life. They both come from the large ocean of life, and both must return to it.
In the Weapons Shop...
ManListen, I'm sorry about last time. Yuffie told me not to sell anything to you.
Weapons ShopkeeperHey yo! Welcome!Strike while the iron's hot, I say! We got some of the best blades right out of the furnace!
Little KidAlright, alright, alright! I know!On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!Why Da-chao? Alright, alright, alright! I don't know!
Cloud and the others enter the pagoda.
If Yuffie is in the party and they try to proceed to the second floor without fighting...
GorkyFreeze!Miss Yuffie! You cannot go on to the second floor until you defeat me!
GorkyOh, Miss Yuffie! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?
Yuffie- Yeah, that's it- No way!
GorkyThen I, Sacred Gorky, will be your opponent on the first floor!
A boy runs down from upstairs.
ShakeYo! They call me Shake! I'll be watchin' your fight with Gorky!
GorkyThen, begin!Power Change!
Yuffie fights Gorky.

If she loses...
GorkyIt's just my opinion, but you need more training! Gorky is disappointed!
ShakeNo good! You have to do Gorky! Are you mocking this Pagoda?
YuffieShut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


If she wins...
GorkyHere I am, Miss Yuffie!
YuffieOf course!
ShakeHmm, I thought you were just a wild girl, but you handled that pretty well!Well, we'll see how you do on next one...

Shake goes upstairs. If Cloud returns to talk to Gorky without Yuffie in the party...
GorkyWinning Miss Yuffie's heart must mean you have tremendous skill.
On the second floor, without Yuffie...
ShakeYou aren't good enough to be here! This is the Wutai Temple of Martial Arts!
Once Yuffie proceeds to the second floor, she can try to go to the next floor prematurely...
ShakeHey, you there! Don't ignore me!
YuffieWho's next?
ShakeAre you blind? I'm right here!
YuffieWhat? I gotta fight a punk?
ShakeHeh! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl!
YuffieWh, what did you say!?
ShakeSee what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so immature!Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me!
YuffieNow watch...!
Shake'bout the only thing you do really good is breathe! Sure you're brave enough to fight!
Yuffie- Stop yappin'!- I'll forgive you

Stop yappin'!
ChekhovHm, so someone finally got past Gorky.


I'll forgive you
ShakeSo when it comes down to it, you're just all talk. Brat!

Once Yuffie decides to fight, a woman comes down from upstairs.
ChekhovSo, I guess it's time for Chekhov to stand in...
ShakeHere I go, brat! Speed Change!
Yuffie fights Shake.

If she loses...
ShakeHYAAAAAAH! BRATBRATBRATBRAT!!
ChekhovYou can't go to the next floor unless you beat Shake.
YuffieShut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


If she wins...
ShakeURRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit!
YuffieOf course!
ChekhovHo, ho, ho... It's been a while since I felt pain...

Chekhov goes upstairs. If Cloud returns to talk to Shake without Yuffie in the party...
ShakeCompared to me, all of you are nothin' but a buncha babies.
On the third floor, without Yuffie...
ChekhovThat being the case, we have nothing further to discuss.
Once Yuffie proceeds to the third floor, she can try to go to the next floor prematurely...
ChekhovHow dare they mock us like that, thinking they could sneak past us.
A man comes down from the fourth floor.
StanivSo even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had to fight, Chekhov.
ChekhovUnfortunately, this is as far as it goes. Staniv, you watch over there.
YuffieThat ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength of youth!
ChekhovKeep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to get burned.
Yuffie- I got insurance- Let's get this over with, old bag

I got insurance
ChekhovHo, ho, ho. We'll see if you still talk like that after you taste some of my Sacred Magic...Magic Change!


Let's get this over with, old bag
ChekhovHo, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of diapers!?
StanivFirst, Chekhov will keep you company...

Yuffie fights Chekhov.

If she loses...
ChekhovHo, ho, ho! What does a immature young child know...?
StanivSo this IS the average person's limit...
YuffieShut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


If she wins...
ChekhovI can't believe you beat me...
YuffieOf course!
StanivThis should be interesting...! It's been a long time since I've had a chance to use my powers to their fullest...

Staniv goes upstairs. If Cloud returns to talk to Chekhov without Yuffie in the party...
ChekhovManaging that girl must be exceedingly rough on you.
On the fourth floor, without Yuffie...
StanivIf it were not for Miss Yuffie, I wouldn't be facing him...
Once Yuffie proceeds to the fourth floor, she can try to go to the next floor prematurely...
StanivHAAAAH!
The door closes.
StanivThe rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your opponent... Although it's a five-storied pagoda, the fourth floor is the highest...In other words, no one has ever defeated me--Master of Weaponry!You still want to try...?
Yuffie- Just come on!!- I'll pass!

Just come on!!
StanivI like you! Now watch...Weapon Change!


I'll pass!
StanivYou don't seem like the kind of person who can make it to the fourth floor without a problem...

Yuffie fights Staniv.

If she loses...
StanivHow unfortunate! It was over before I could even put all of my strength into it...
YuffieShut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


If she wins...
StanivWh, what...!?
YuffieOf course!

The others start coming up from the lower floors.
GorkySplendid! Your level and skills have improved...
ShakeOh, ho! You might not be as much of a child as we thought you were!
ChekhovOf course. If WE lost to her...
StanivYou have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to face HIM......!
He goes upstairs, and the others follow. If Cloud proceeds to the fifth floor without Yuffie...
Godo...Hm. You can do it......
Once Yuffie proceeds to the fifth floor, she finds the four of them standing on either side of the room with Godo at the head.
Gorky......
ShakeSh......!
Chekhov...
Staniv......
YuffieD, ...Dad!?
GodoI'm glad you made it this far, Yuffie!
YuffieWhy, why are you......
GodoI'll answer you by having you try your skills against me!Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you don't... then I'll have to kill you!
YuffieH... hey!
GodoWhat are you doing! OMNI-Change! ......!!
Yuffie fights Godo.If she loses...
YuffieDammit......
GodoOhhh! And what was that!? Come back when you get more training!
When Yuffie tries again...
YuffieI'll show you this time, you old Fart-meister!
GodoHmm? A slight improvement.Come at me with all you have! OMNI-Change! ......!!
After winning the battle, both lie sprawled on the floor panting.
Yuffie...heave...... heave...
Godo...huff...... puff......
YuffieO... old coot... n...... ot... bad...
GodoYou've...... also...... improved...
YuffieHah... Ha, ha......
Godo...Heh, heh......
YuffieHa ha haaaaaa......!
GodoWaha haaaaa......!
They eventually get up off the floor and compose themselves.
GodoIt's time I gave this to you, Yuffie...This is Leviathan Materia. Take it.
Received ""Leviathan"" Materia!
StanivBut, Lord Godo. The Leviathan Materia should only be given to the person who conquers and takes over this Pagoda. That is our custom...
YuffieCUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM... I'm so sick of hearing that!It's so stupid!
GorkySilence, Miss Yuffie!
YuffieThen what 'bout the rest of you? You have all that power...Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?
GodoYuffie...!
YuffieYou too, dad...! Just because you lost the war!And turning Wutai into a place like this!
Chekhov...What do you want to say?
YuffieYou turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to tourists...How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!!
Godo...
ShakeShe IS a kid.
YuffieWh, what did you say...!?
GodoYuffie!!Forgive me... It's all my fault...
GorkyWhat are you saying, Lord Godo!
GodoLosing the war... turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault...
ChekhovLord Godo!
GodoSilence!!Yuffie......I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war.But, after I lost the war, I began to think...Is strength, only for defeating the enemy?...or just something to show-off to others...?Might begets might.That's the same way as the Shinra...
Yuffie......
GodoI knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai.But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai...And now, I realize both are necessary...Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless...!
StanivLord Godo...
GodoYou there, please take Yuffie with you!I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!

BarretJes' don't do nothin' funny to our Materia...!
AerisAll right. We'll take your daughter with us.
Tifa...after that, how can we refuse?
NanakiAs long as she doesn't get in our way...!
Cait SithIf you put it that way, we can't refuse...
VincentHmm... You may come if you want to...
CidWell, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the rest to ol' Cid!

CloudAll right, I don't mind.
GodoGo, Yuffie!For the sake of strengthening Wutai!
YuffieDad...
GodoI'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return!Go! And come back alive!
Yuffie......Of course!
Everyone else files out, and Yuffie starts to follow them.
GodoYuffie, wait a minute.The Materia they all have...After their battle is over, you think they'll still want it?
YuffieDad...!
GodoGo! Survive till the end! And return!With the Materia!
YuffieHeh, heh... you bet!
She runs off.
Afterwards...
GodoGo! Survive to the end! And return to us!Mat-...Take care of the Materia!!
Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:
Your Mat-...I mean, please look after Yuffie...!
StanivMiss Yuffie. Your feelings for Wutai are the same as Lord Godo's. Always remember that...
Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:
Please take care of Miss Yuffie.
ChekhovFight so that you never bring shame on Wutai.
Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:
She's always like this. It'll be rougher on you.
ShakeYou say there's some unusual materia where the underground pipe is!?But, first you gotta get if from a monster and unless you use your head. You won't be able to do it.
Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:
Did that kid mature at all?
GorkyMiss Yuffie. We pray for your success!
Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:
Oh, you there! How is Miss Yuffie doing?
Cloud and the others leave Wutai and return to their quest.

Weapons Shopkeeper,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Sorry, listen I... No, nothing... never mind."
Man,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Sorry, but we're entirely sold out now.What's this here? Ah, no... that's uh......a sample! Yeah, that's it... a sample. Sorry, but why don't you all come back later?"

Barkeeper,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hey, hey, welcome! You on a trip? Well, just relax and make yourself at home.Nowadays, thanks to tourism, Wutai's able to get by."
Man,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hey. Did you hear? There used to be a Water God here in Wutai.They say the Water God was a huge snake!Now we live in a world filled with Mako. Not many people would believe in something like that now.But some in the world, and here in Wutai, still believe.Believe in the scales of the Water God and in materia that has its power in it."
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Yy, you!? How did you get here...?"
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"...Elena, you talk too much."
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Ww, what?"
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,We're taking our vacation and resting up from our work.
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Now our vacation is ruined.
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"B, but..."
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...even the booze tastes bad now.
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...sorry...
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight!The next time we meet I won't be so nice."
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Drink, Rude! How long have we been a team...?There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm glad I did it.I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you."
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,To the Turks... To Reno... cheers!
Little Kid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Alright, alright, alright! I know!On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!A girl with materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing Da-chao for some time now.You know I've noticed that there's  pounding noise from time to time in this store."
Man on the Path to Godo's House,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Lord Godo is in this house.He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep......Anyhow, for some reason Yuffie's had a fondness for materia ever since I can remember.She's always hung around places she thought might have it."
Item Shopkeeper,Wutai - Stolen Materia,We got a lot of different stuff here. Take what you want.
Woman,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I'm sorry. The sign outside says ""Materia"", but there's almost no materia left anywhere in Wutai.Listen, this is just a backwoods town. We don't have much to do with Shinra, and besides...If we had a lot of materia, Wutai would be a much more exciting town, but we don't..."
Woman,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Huh? What? You DID?
Man outside Godo's House,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"That five-storied pagoda over there is called the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods...The Five Gods are Power, Speed, Magic, War and Omni, who has the best characteristics of everything.Since ancient times, we in Wutai, have worshipped Da-chao and the Water God.Legend has it that the village has been protected by Da-chao, the Water God, and the Five Mighty Gods.But in the last battle, we didn't fare so well... I guess our beliefs were based on nothing more than legends."
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Freeze!You aren't from Wutai, are you?"
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,- No- Yes
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Only those from Wutai are allowed in the tower!I'll have to ask for you to leave!
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hey! I hate people who lie about their identities! Leave this tower at once!
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"GOOGAH... what do you want?Don't have... GAH... anything much but, you should be able to... GOO... rest yourselves here. GOGAH... make yourselves at home.......Yuffie? ......nope, never heard of her. ...GOOGO......you again? I told you once, and I'm telling you again, I don't know her."
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"What's with you, you coward!"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Yuffie......!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"You scared of the Shinra?Then why don't you fall into line and obey them, just like all of the other towns!"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Shut up! What would you know about this?
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"You get beaten once, and then that's it?What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,No kid like you's going to talk to me like that!You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"That's my style! And it's my own business, not yours! Don't you try and dictate what I should do!"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Style...? Dictate...?Throwin' around all those fancy words... You're a miserable daughter!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!!
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"......take your things and get out of here now.To protect Wutai, we cannot afford to stand up to Shinra."
Man on the Path to Godo's House,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.Like father like daughter...Yuffie's like that, you know. Sometimes she'll just bust into people's houses.Then she hides in the shadows... Just like a little kid."
Woman Walking near River,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Life is just like the flowing of a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it.Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see.Yuffie? I saw her a while ago. She must be in one of the houses around here."
Boy,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Oh no! More weirdosNo, these aren't like the one from a while ago, but these ones look weird too!"
Old Man,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Well, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see... what was your name?"
Boy,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"No, Gramps! This isn't anyone you know! This is just some stranger who barged into our house!What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl came in here a minute ago and I..."
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,......
Old Man,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Oh, how exciting. You a friend of my grandson's?"
Boy,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"No, Gramps! These guy's are creepy! They're runnin' all over the place!"
Man on the Path to Godo's House,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.Like father like daughter...That reminds me, Lately I've been seeing a kid around here that reminds me of Yuffie.Always sneakin' around corners And into somethin' she shouldn't be."
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wait, that damn Yuffie's still gotta be somewhere in this cheap town! Or you all jes' gonna go on?"
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I don't think she came out from here... Is that ok?
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Knowing Yuffie, she's still hidden somewhere in town. You sure?"
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I know she hasn't left town! You still want to leave?
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,She couldn't have left town... I think she is must still be here... Or do you want to go on?
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,You lettin' that damn kid off the hook? I know she's gotta be in this town somewhere!
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"You can't get away, Yuffie."
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Give it up, Yuffie!"
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"You lost, Yuffie."
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"O... ok, I know... I was wrong......You win. I'll give you back your materia..."
Shinra Soldier,Wutai - Stolen Materia,So our reports were right! He IS here on vacation!We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up!
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...what a drag.
Shinra Soldier,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wh, what was that...?"
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Right now we're off duty and can't run off to save your butts.
Shinra Soldier,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"We know you're off duty, but..."
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"If you knew that, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' me sober."
Shinra Soldier,Wutai - Stolen Materia,But you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too!
Shinra Soldier,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"All right, that's it! We'll get him without any help from the Turks, just you see!"
Shinra Soldier,Wutai - Stolen Materia,And don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about this!!
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Reno, do you think that was really such a good idea!?I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk would act!?"
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Elena. Don't misunderstand.A pro isn't someone who sacrifices himself for his job. That's just a fool.
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Rude...?
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,.........
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Well, I don't buy that! Goodbye!!"
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,.........
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Relax. She's not a child. Let her have her way now...
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I know, the materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. ...Follow me."
Flyer on Wall,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"[Turtle's Paradise] No. 6Drink at the ""Turtle's Paradise"" And talk about Wutai!You'll know ""Turtle's Paradise"" by the big pot outside!!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"...I've been hearing that ever since I was little.Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more important...You saw what it looks like now, right? ...JUST a resort town...After we lost the war, we got peace, but with that, we lost something else. Now look at Wutai...That's why... if I had lots of materia I could..."
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Listen, Yuffie. I don't care about the history of Wutai or your feelings.You've got our materia and I want it back... now.If you give it back now, we'll drop the whole thing."
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I'm sorry, Yuffie. I know how you feel, but we need materia too....We just can't let you have it. Please understand."
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"......Dammit, Yuffie. We ain't got time to be listening to your life story.If you want materia, get it yourself. That's how you should do it."
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I know. I know that...That... sniff... switch... the lever on the left...... materia's... sniff, hic... in there."
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Ain't nuthin' we can do about it...
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I feel bad, but......"
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Now, the Materia..."
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Were we a little too harsh on her?
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Well, let's get our materia back."
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,There was nothing else to do.
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hmmph... I dunno......
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,- Flip the Left Lever- Flip the Right Lever
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Wh...what the hell is this!?
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Eyaaaaah
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Eyaaaaah
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wh, what are you doing!?"
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wh, what is this!?"
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,!?
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Whoa!?
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Ha ha ha------! Never trust anyone that easily!! / Ha ha------! You should've listened!!The Materia's mine! Tough!You want your materia? Then go find it yourself!Yeah that's right. And when you're looking for the materia, remember you gotta steel it.Heh heh... steel... steel! Get it?C ya!!"
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Y, yo, wait up!!"
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wait, don't leave us!"
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,W...wait don't leave us here!
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Help us first!
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hey help us...please!
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wait, don't go by yourself!"
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hey! Help me first!
Barkeeper,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Seems like the town got really boisterous since you arrived. Did anything happen?
Barkeeper,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Congrats! You have just found all six flyers for the ""Turtles Paradise""!How wonderful! Now here is your prize, just as we promised!!"
Barkeeper,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Please come again to ""Turtles Paradise""! We're looking forward to seeing you!"
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,......It's just that we're off duty!I don't feel like drinking with you. And don't talk to me.
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,.........
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Let go! I SAID let GO!Hey! Who do you think I...... OW! What're you doin'...? Jerk!
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,You......!
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Oh! You're......!
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Ww, who are you!?"
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"......ho..... ...............ho.........Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!"
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Corneo!?
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Don Corneo!?
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,The hell are you doing!
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hohi!I've finally got a new chicky!Two for one, in fact! Hohi, hohi!"
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",Wutai - Stolen Materia,Two!?
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,H......hey! Let go of me! You're gonna regret this!!
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!"
Shinra Soldier,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Now listen up! They must be in the area! Find them no matter what!
Shinra Soldier,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Yes, sir!!"
Shinra Soldier,Wutai - Stolen Materia,There he is! It's Corneo! Don't let him get away!Attaaaack!
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hmm... that Corneo is good at escaping...
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,......Elena.
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Let's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can do."
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,......Sounded pretty good.
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"......Ok. Corneo took Yuffie from us.And without Yuffie, there's no way we'll get our materia back."
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"......all right. Corneo stole Yuffie from us, as well.And without her, there's no way we'll get our materia back."
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"......that's just beautiful! And now that *#$^@'s walked off with Yuffie, too!And without that brat, we can't get our hands on our materia!"
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Don't misunderstand.We have no intention of joining you. But for now, we'll agree not to bother each other. That's all."
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"That's fine. We have absolutely no intention of cooperating with the Turks either.Now, uh, just what direction did Corneo run off to?"
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,The same goes for us. We don't want to be friendly with the Turks.Now which direction did Corneo run off in?
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Of course! There ain't no way we'd wanna join up with the Turks anyway!Anyhow, which direction did that %^$*& run off in?"
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the place that stands out the most."
Man on the Path to Godo's House,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Two girls just went off towards Da-chao. I wonder if that place is starting to become popular with the kids?One had herself all tangled up in a rope. And the other one kind of looked like Yuffie.
Little Kid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Alright, alright, alright! I saw an old man in flashy clothes running towards Da-chao!He was babblin' somethin' and looked like he could float! It almost bowled me over!"
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"You're finally here. We're gonna split into two.You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena.Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, Yuffie.For now..."
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Don't fool around. You know the enemy's not gonna wait for us, right?"
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,......
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Whoa!!Can't go through here... That flame would make crispy critters of us in an instant.
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Eyaaaah!There is no way past this!
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Damn, that's hot!I like hot baths, but this is TOO hot!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,LET... ME...... GO!!!!

Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"He... hey, I'm one of the 'Turks'! Don't think you can get away with this!?"
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Or... maybe... HER?

Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Be quiet! None of you know how much I've suffered since then...It's a long story, but......"
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I don't really care! Let Yuffie and Elena go!
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,We don't want to hear it! Just let the two go!
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I don't really give a damn! You're gonna let the two girls go, or else I'm gonna break your arm!"
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hmm... You guys are... serious. ......Good, good....this ain't no time for me to be fooling around either...Why did you kill my little Aps?I'm gonna make you PLAY with my new pet, so you won't get in the way of my search for a bride!RAPPS---come here!!"
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Wait...Just wait a second!
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,SHUT UP!
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,You better say your prayers!
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Don't be such a poor loser, old man!"
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Just listen to me - it won't take long.Why do you think a bad guy like me would swallow his pride and plead for his life?
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",Wutai - Stolen Materia,- 1 Because he's ready to die- 2 Because he's sure to win- 3 Because he's clueless
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hmm...! WRONG...!
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hmm...! RIGHT!
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hmm...! Close, but no cigar...!"

Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?

Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,DAMMIT! Then they're all goin' with me!
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Ugh...!
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Good timing, Rude."
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...Let's get to work.
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"All right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up.Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with those guys to get you...?1. Because we were ready to die2. Because we were sure of victory3. Because we were clueless"
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Two... Number two?
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,All wrong.
Corneo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"No...! Wait, sto......!"
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,The correct answer was...
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...because it's our job.
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Oh, thank you very much...!I never expected you'd to come help......"
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Elena, don't act so weak.You're a Turks!"
Elena,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Y... Yes, sir!"

Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I guess, thanks for today."
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,......

Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Yeah, they want us to find Cloud..."
Rude,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Are we on...?
Reno,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"No, today we're off duty."
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hey---who cares about that!? Get----me-----down----!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Phew, perfect. Now the materia is back in its rightful place."
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hey... the placement of it is all messed up.
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hey, what is this...? The placement of it's all messed up!"
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What the hell's goin' on!? The placement of the materia's all messed up!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Huh? Oh, it'll be all right...Don't be so picky!Anyways, that sure was close......No, normally I would kick their butts, Boom, Bang!!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy.
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Oh, by the way, some of those guys from the Turks are good, huh?At least, after all that, we got the materia back.Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey..."
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,".........Come on, wait---!"
Woman Walking near River,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Materia is like Life. They both come from the large ocean of life, and both must return to it."
Man,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Listen, I'm sorry about last time. Yuffie told me not to sell anything to you."
Weapons Shopkeeper,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hey yo! Welcome!Strike while the iron's hot, I say! We got some of the best blades right out of the furnace!"
Little Kid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Alright, alright, alright! I know!On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!Why Da-chao? Alright, alright, alright! I don't know!"
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Freeze!Miss Yuffie! You cannot go on to the second floor until you defeat me!
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Oh, Miss Yuffie! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"- Yeah, that's it- No way!"
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Then I, Sacred , will be your opponent on the first floor!"
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Yo! They call me ! I'll be watchin' your fight with Gorky!
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Then, begin!Power Change!"
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"It's just my opinion, but you need more training!  is disappointed!"
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,No good! You have to do Gorky! Are you mocking this Pagoda?
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Here I am, Miss Yuffie!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Of course!
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hmm, I thought you were just a wild girl, but you handled that pretty well!Well, we'll see how you do on next one..."
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Winning Miss Yuffie's heart must mean you have tremendous skill.
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,You aren't good enough to be here! This is the Wutai Temple of Martial Arts!
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hey, you there! Don't ignore me!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Who's next?
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Are you blind? I'm right here!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What? I gotta fight a punk?
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Heh! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wh, what did you say!?"
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,See what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so immature!Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Now watch...!
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,'bout the only thing you do really good is breathe! Sure you're brave enough to fight!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,- Stop yappin'!- I'll forgive you
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hm, so someone finally got past Gorky."
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"So when it comes down to it, you're just all talk. Brat!"
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"So, I guess it's time for  to stand in..."
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Here I go, brat! Speed Change!"
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,HYAAAAAAH! BRATBRATBRATBRAT!!
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,You can't go to the next floor unless you beat Shake.
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,URRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Of course!
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Ho, ho, ho... It's been a while since I felt pain..."
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Compared to me, all of you are nothin' but a buncha babies."
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"That being the case, we have nothing further to discuss."
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"How dare they mock us like that, thinking they could sneak past us."
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"So even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had to fight, Chekhov."
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes. Staniv, you watch over there."
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,That ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength of youth!
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Keep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to get burned."
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"- I got insurance- Let's get this over with, old bag"
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Ho, ho, ho. We'll see if you still talk like that after you taste some of my Sacred Magic...Magic Change!"
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Ho, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of diapers!?"
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"First, Chekhov will keep you company..."
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Ho, ho, ho! What does a immature young child know...?"
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,So this IS the average person's limit...
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I can't believe you beat me...
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Of course!
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,This should be interesting...! It's been a long time since I've had a chance to use my powers to their fullest...
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Managing that girl must be exceedingly rough on you.
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"If it were not for Miss Yuffie, I wouldn't be facing him..."
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,HAAAAH!
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"The rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your opponent... Although it's a five-storied pagoda, the fourth floor is the highest...In other words, no one has ever defeated me--Master of Weaponry!You still want to try...?"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,- Just come on!!- I'll pass!
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I like you! Now watch...Weapon Change!
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,You don't seem like the kind of person who can make it to the fourth floor without a problem...
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,How unfortunate! It was over before I could even put all of my strength into it...
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wh, what...!?"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Of course!
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Splendid! Your level and skills have improved...
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Oh, ho! You might not be as much of a child as we thought you were!"
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Of course. If WE lost to her...
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"You have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to face HIM......!"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...Hm. You can do it......
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,......
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Sh......!
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,......
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"D, ...Dad!?"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I'm glad you made it this far, Yuffie!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Why, why are you......"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I'll answer you by having you try your skills against me!Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you don't... then I'll have to kill you!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,H... hey!
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,What are you doing! OMNI-Change! ......!!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Dammit......
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Ohhh! And what was that!? Come back when you get more training!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I'll show you this time, you old Fart-meister!"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hmm? A slight improvement.Come at me with all you have! OMNI-Change! ......!!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...heave...... heave...

Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,You've...... also...... improved...
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Hah... Ha, ha......"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"...Heh, heh......"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Ha ha haaaaaa......!
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Waha haaaaa......!
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"It's time I gave this to you, Yuffie...This is Leviathan Materia. Take it."
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"But, Lord Godo. The Leviathan Materia should only be given to the person who conquers and takes over this Pagoda. That is our custom..."
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"CUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM... I'm so sick of hearing that!It's so stupid!"
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Silence, Miss Yuffie!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Then what 'bout the rest of you? You have all that power...Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Yuffie...!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"You too, dad...! Just because you lost the war!And turning Wutai into a place like this!"
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...What do you want to say?
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,You turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to tourists...How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!!
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,...
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,She IS a kid.
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Wh, what did you say...!?"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Yuffie!!Forgive me... It's all my fault...
Gorky,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"What are you saying, Lord Godo!"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Losing the war... turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault...
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Lord Godo!
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Silence!!Yuffie......I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war.But, after I lost the war, I began to think...Is strength, only for defeating the enemy?...or just something to show-off to others...?Might begets might.That's the same way as the Shinra..."
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,......
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"I knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai.But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai...And now, I realize both are necessary...Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless...!"
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Lord Godo...
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"You there, please take Yuffie with you!I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!"
Barret,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Jes' don't do nothin' funny to our Materia...!
Aeris,Wutai - Stolen Materia,All right. We'll take your daughter with us.
Tifa,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"...after that, how can we refuse?"
Nanaki,Wutai - Stolen Materia,As long as she doesn't get in our way...!
Cait Sith,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"If you put it that way, we can't refuse..."
Vincent,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Hmm... You may come if you want to...
Cid,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Well, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the rest to ol' !"
Cloud,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"All right, I don't mind."
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Go, Yuffie!For the sake of strengthening Wutai!"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Dad...
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,I'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return!Go! And come back alive!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,......Of course!
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Yuffie, wait a minute.The Materia they all have...After their battle is over, you think they'll still want it?"
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Dad...!
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Go! Survive till the end! And return!With the Materia!
Yuffie,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"Heh, heh... you bet!"
Godo,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Go! Survive to the end! And return to us!Mat-...Take care of the Materia!!
Staniv,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Miss Yuffie. Your feelings for Wutai are the same as Lord Godo's. Always remember that...
Chekhov,Wutai - Stolen Materia,Fight so that you never bring shame on Wutai.
Shake,Wutai - Stolen Materia,"You say there's some unusual materia where the underground pipe is!?But, first you gotta get if from a monster and unless you use your head. You won't be able to do it."

Weapon Seller,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,"What? You didn't come here for that?The ""Keystone"" is the key that unlocks the gate to a very old temple somewhere.You're not going to believe your ears,But I heard it was the Temple of the Ancients!!"

Cloud,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,Who did you sell it to?
Weapon Seller,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,"The manager of the Gold Saucer... think his name was ""Dio"". Said he was going to put it in his museum, then he took off out of here."
Weapon Seller,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,"Come on... it's only a legend. But if it were true, that sure would be something, huh?Now that you mention it, I have heard of something called Ultimate Destruction Magicwas supposed to be hidden somewhere in the Temple of the Ancients."
Cloud,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,Ultimate Destruction Magic...?
Weapon Seller,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,Come on! I told you not to take it seriously!
Weapon Seller,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,"All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't been able to get materials...Hey you wouldn't happen to have any Mythril on you, would you? I'll trade you something good if you could spare some."
Cloud,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,- Give him some- Forget it

Redhead,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,"Oh, it's you? I heard you and the Captain really made a BANG!I also heard that Rufus was so pissed off he went on a rampage and that no one's been able to get near him!"
Mechanic,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,"I heard Tiny Bronco broke...That sucks. I was secretly eyeing that thing. Broke, huh? What a drag."
Old Man,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,"Because those Shinra creeps locked us up in our houses, we couldn't even watch the rocket lift off.I never thought that my only hobby would be destroyed by that arrogant young Rufus...!"

Cloud,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,- Have you seen Sephiroth?- What are you doing?
Excavator,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,"Oh, the man in a Black Cape. He was looking for the Temple of the Ancients."
Cloud,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,- The Temple of the Ancients?
Excavator,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,It's way down south. It's right on the other side between this town and the inland sea.It's the pyramid that rises within the forest.
Cloud,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,- How do you get in?
Excavator,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,You'll need a Keystone.
Cloud,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,- What's a Keystone?
Excavator,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,Just like it sounds. A rock that's a key. I heard that some rich guy has it.
Excavator,The World - Before the Temple of the Ancients,We're excavating. It's like the land's telling a history of the planet.
Man,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"A buncha guys called Turks came here sayin' they'd pay 10000 gil for some rock called a 'Keystone'.When I asked how much they'd pay for a regular rock just layin' around here, they slapped me upside my damn head!!"
Man 2,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I'll never understand the rich. I heard some guy named Dio at the Gold Saucer is collectin' rocks!
Fortune Telling Machine,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,(at Wonder Square)What you are looking for is near.
Man,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I heard that this is the curator's favorite attraction. He likes it so much that he even has his collection displayed in the arena.
Woman,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Are you here for the battle, too?"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,- That's the idea- Not interested
Woman,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I like fighters. But hate those who're all talk.
Woman,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Is that so.
Black-haired Man,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Crap! I still don't have enough points.Mmm? You're new here, aren't you? Then, you want an explanation of the Battle Arena?"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,- Yeah- Not interested
Black-haired Man,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"You fight here and collect battle points. You can then exchange those points for prizes.The Battle Game... even though it's a game you still use all your physical abilities. To participate, go to the front and pay yer GP's.You can fight in up to eight battles. The more you win, the more battle points you get.But, if you lose, you lose all your points. So it's up to you whether or not to fight after each win.They also make it harder by givin' out handicaps.They decide what handicaps there'll be, and you won't know what you're up against until the battle.Oh yeah, once you leave the Battle area, all your battle points will become useless. So watch it.Oh, and one other thing. The maximum points you could get is 65000, no more. So if you get that many you should exchange them for something."
Black-haired Man,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Hmm...So, uh, how've things been since then?"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,- No sweat- They're going
Black-haired Man,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Hmm, pretty good."
Black-haired Man,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Ha ha ha! Well, good luck."
Large Man,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Maybe I could've made it a little further. It's so hard to know when to stop...Man, I knew I should've stopped. But it's so hard to stop..."
Man Practicing Kicks,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"I'm not going to lose this time!All right, it should be my turn comin' up here soon."
Registration Lady,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Hey, have you heard? Something awful happened!Two staff members and some Shinra soldiers were shot.The soldiers died instantly, but the staff survived."
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Dyne......
Registration Lady,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Register for battle? The registration fee is 10 GP.
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,- Let's do it- Not interested
Registration Lady,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,This is a one-on-one battle. Which one of you will participate?
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Well, I guess I'll enjoy a few battles."
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I'm gonna bust the place up!
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Let's make this quick.

Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,It's the Keystone...
Dio,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Heh, heh, heh. Long time no see, my boy. Hmm? You like that, huh?"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Can you let me borrow this?
Dio,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Heh, heh, heh. Sorry, but it's not for rent.Hmm.Since you've been good to me in the past, I CAN let you have it on one condition."
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,One condition?
Dio,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Heh, heh, heh. Entertain me!"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,- What'd you want me to do?- Not in the mood
Dio,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Hoo boy!Heh, heh, heh. It's not something that's really difficult.This is the Battle Arena. Show me your fighting skills. Just you, my boy. I'm expecting a good fight!"
Dio,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I see... Then let's pretend that this never happened.
Dio,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Heh, heh, heh! Well done, young man! All right, as I promised,you can take it. Oh, and I'll give you this too."
Dio,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Hmm, you did pretty well, young man!Good, it's a promise, so go ahead and take it. I'll give this to you too."
Dio,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"That's the best you could do? Well, a promise is a promise. Go ahead, take it."
Dio,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Well then, we shall meet again! Heh, heh, heh."
Staff,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Excuse me, sir.I'm sorry. The Tram is out of order right now."
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,...so?
Staff,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I'm really sorry!I'm afraid you won't be able to leave until it's fully repaired.
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,What's wrong?
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Too bad. It happens, though.I know! Let's stay at the hotel! They know me here. I'll go talk to them."
Staff,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I will let you know once the repairs are completed.
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"We don't usually get the chance to be together like this, huh?Cloud, how 'bout it? Can you tell us what's happened so far?I don't really know what's goin' on because I wasn't here in the beginning."
Cid,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Yeah! I'm all for it!
Vincent,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Good idea.
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"I been here since the beginnin', an' I still don't know what the hell's goin' on either.Cloud, the hell's goin' on? C'mon, tell us!"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"- I'm tired...- All right, I'll give it a shot..."
Cid,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,All we have to do now is sleep! You're still young! What're you complaining about?
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Phew...We are going after Sephiroth.Sephiroth must be in search of the Promised Land.
Cid,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,The Promised Land?
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,A land full of Mako energy. ...or at least that's what the Shinra believe.I don't know if it actually exists.
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,The Cetras return to the Promised Land. A land that promises boundless happiness.
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Cetra? That some kinda disease?
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"That's what the Ancients call themselves.Hey, didn't you listen to the elders at Cosmo Canyon?"
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"...You don't 'know' where the Promised Land of the Ancients is.You search and travel, until you feel it. Like you just know, '...this is the Promised Land.'"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Aeris... can you feel it too?
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I think so.
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,So Sephiroth is traveling the world because he's searching for the Promised Land? Is that it?
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"That, and one other thing he's searching for."
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,The Black Materia...
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I heard from Dio that a man in a Black Cape was lookin' for the Black Materia.
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I don't even know what the Black Cape is...How many men with Black Capes and number tattoos are there?
Nanaki,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"...you know, of course... My tattoo is number 13."
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,How did you get that tattoo?
Nanaki,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"...Hojo put it on me. Everything else is just war scars, but the number was done by Hojo."
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,So there are at least 13!?
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,...You know......I think Hojo did something to those men in the Black Capes.But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though...That's why I think we should just go after Sephiroth himself.
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Yeah, me too! It's all just too damn confusin'."
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"And...I'm sorry, forget it!I think I'm tired. I'm going to bed now."
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"What was that, all of a sudden!?"
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,What!? That's it? I'm goin' to bed!
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Is that all? How 'bout the Black Materia?
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,You wouldn't understand even if I told you.
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Now all we gotta do is take action! We're startin' tomorrow!!
Nanaki,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Cloud...I'm number 13. Am I going to go mad too?
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"I don't know what Hojo did to you, but you've been all right so far, right?"
Nanaki,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,But...
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Be strong.
Nanaki,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"But, I..."
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Stop it, Nanaki! Be strong!"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Tifa?
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,You're not the only one who's worried!
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"I don't know what's goin' on, but we're in a bad situation..."
Vincent,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Hey Cid, let's go back to our rooms."
Cid,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,...zzzz... zzzz...

Woman at Ticket Booth,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Here you are, two tickets.Enjoy the sights of Gold Saucer."
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Hey foo. What you wanna see fireworks with me for?
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Not having fun?
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,You should've asked one or the other!
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Which would you have asked?
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Oh man, there just ain't no choice!Tifa, Aeris.Ah, Yuffie?"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,(hoo boy)

Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Hey? What's Cait Sith doing?
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,That's...... Cait Sith. He seems strange.
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Hey, isn't that Cait Sith? What's he doing?"
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,...it's Cait Sith. What's he doin' so quietly?
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,!!Is that the... Keystone?Hey! Cait Sith!
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,We've got no time for this! Let's go after Cait Sith!
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,We've got no time to relax. Let's go after Cait Sith!
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Is it all right to relax like that? Aren't we going after Cait Sith?
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,What're ya doin'? We're goin' after Cait Sith!
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,We don't have time for this! We've got to go after Cait Sith.
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,There's no time to be riding this. Let's hurry after Cait Sith!
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Can we be wasting time like this? Aren't we going after Cait Sith?
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,The hell you doin'!? We gotta go after Cait Sith!
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,There's no time for this! We have to go after Cait Sith.
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,There's no time to waste. Let's hurry and go after Cait Sith!
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Should we be wasting time like this? Aren't we going after Cait Sith?
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,The hell're you doin'!? We're goin' after Cait Sith!
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,We don't have time for that!? Let's hurry and go after Cait Sith!
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,There's no time to waste. Let's hurry after Cait Sith!
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Should we be doing that? We've got to go after Cait Sith?
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Whacha doin!? We're goin' after Cait Sith!
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,There's no time for that!! Let's hurry and go after Cait Sith!
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,We got no time to relax. Let's hurry and go after Cait Sith!
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,You got time to fool around like that? Aren't you goin' after Cait Sith?
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,What the hell are you doing!? We gotta go after that damn cat!
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"There's no time for this, right!? Let's hurry after Cait Sith!"
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,There's no time to relax. Let's hurry after Cait Sith!
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Should we be this laid back? Aren't we going after Cait Sith?
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,What the hell are you doing! Let's get Cait Sith!
Lady at Entrance,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Sir, we can't have you doing that!"
Bystanders,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,What?
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Hey! Over here! The Keystone!
Tseng,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Well done.
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Hey!
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"W, wait a second. I won't run or hide.Yes, I was a spy. I was hired by the Shinra."
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,...I trusted you. I can't believe you!
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Don't mess with us!
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,You think I'm jokin'!?
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Ya dirty &*$*%$!
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I couldn't help it.How 'bout if we continue like nothing ever happened?
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"No way, cat! You gotta lot of guts acting like a friend but being a spy!"
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Then, what are you goin' to do? Kill me?You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just a toy anyway.My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controlin' this toy cat from there."
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,So you're from Shinra. Who? Who are you! Tell me!
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,So you're from Shinra. Who are you?
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Part of the Shinra! Who the *&$# are you!?
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,The hell are ya!? What's your real name!?
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Whoa, I can't tell you my name."
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,We're not gettin' anywhere.
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"See? I told you! Talking won't do any good, so can't we just continue our journey?"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,You think I'm jokin'!?
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"...Alright, yes, I am a Shinra employee.But we're not entirely enemies....Something bothers me. I think it's your way of life.You don't get paid. You don't get praised. Yet, you still risk your lives and continue on your journey. Seeing that makes me...It just makes me think about my life. I don't think I'd feel too good if things ended the way they are now."
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"......And so on, and so on..."
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,You're lying again.
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Sounds fishy---
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Hmph! You ain't foolin' us this time!
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"He'll never tell the truth. Once a spy, always a spy.We can't go on with someone like that. C'mon get real!!"
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,...just as I thought. Talking won't make a bit of difference.But I prepared something in case this happened.Why don't you listen to this?
Marlene,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Papa! Tifa!
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Hey! That's Marlene!
Marlene,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Hey! It's the flower lady! Flower lady...
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Marlene!
Marlene,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Hey! It's Tifa! Tifa! Help, I'm-"
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,...Marlene?
Marlene,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Hey! It's Cloud!
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Ma......Marlene!?
Marlene,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Hey! It's Dad! Dad! It's me, !"
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"...So, you have to do as I say."
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,...you're the lowest...
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I didn't want to do this... using dirty tricks and taking hostages...But this is how it is... no compromises. So why don't we continue on as we did?
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Tomorrow is the Temple of the Ancients, right? I know where it is so I'll tell you later.Of course, we'll get there after the Shinra, but you'll have to deal with that."
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Oh, you didn't seem to know this, but...The Keystone is the key to the Temple of the Ancients. Even so, you're all going, right?I know where it is, so I'll show you later.The Shinra have already been there, but I guess you have to deal with that."
Cloud,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"...Well, we're stuck... We'll have to do what he says."
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I wonder if Marlene is all right... I wonder what happened to Mom.
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,......Marlene.
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Uh, yup."
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Sorry, Cloud."
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"What took you so long, Cloud?Oh yeah, about the Temple of the Ancients. I think if we take the Tiny Bronco East towards the sea, we should be able to find it.Well then, shall we get goin'? Who's gonna go?"
Aeris,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I want to go! I'm going for sure!
Barret,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"Yo! I'm goin' too, Cloud! Gotta keep movin'!!"
Tifa,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"You know...... no, forget it. Let's go."
Nanaki,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,"I'm so excited, my tail's starting to tingle. Let's go, Cloud!"
Yuffie,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I'm startin' to get nervous.
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,The Temple of the Ancients is to the east. Shall we go?
Vincent,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,The Temple of the Ancients... This might be pretty interesting...
Cid,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,I don't care what's goin' on let's just go!
Cait Sith,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,Then see you later.
Fortune Telling Machine,Gold Saucer - Interrupted by Fireworks,(at Wonder Square)What you search for is in the Southeast
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"This is... the Temple of the Ancients...I... I know... I feel it... The knowledge of the Ancients... floating...You could become one with the Planet, but you're stopping it with the strength of will.For the future? For us?"
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,What are you saying? Do you understand?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,You're uneasy... But happy?Because I'm here? I'm sorry... I don't understand.
Clone #9,The Temple of the Ancients,Key...... stone......Open... the door... of the Temple...
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Look......
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,It says number 9. He has a tattoo on his neck.
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,Number 9. Another man with a tattoo.
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,He's number 9. There's a tattoo.
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,"He has a tattoo too! Ummm, I think it's number 9."
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,Oh!? It's an number 9 tattoo.
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,It's a number 9 tattoo.
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,"Hey, he's got a tattoo. It says number 9."
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Hey! It's Tseng!
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Tseng? Of the Turks!?
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,Uh... I've been had.It's not the Promised Land... Sephiroth's searching for...
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Sephiroth? He's inside!?
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,Look... for yourself...
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"You're wrong.The Promised Land isn't like what you imagined.And, I'm not going to help.Either way, there was no way Shinra could have won."
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,...pretty harsh. Sounds like something... you'd say.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,You crying?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"...Tseng's with our enemy, the Turks, but I've known him since we were little...There's not a lot of people I can say that about. In fact, there are probably only a handful of people in the world who really know me."
Clone #9,The Temple of the Ancients,Black...... Materia......
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,I am...... still alive...
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Let's put the Keystone in.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Words... feelings... So many of them here.
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,"Damn--! So this is the Temple of the Ancients!Oh man, you gotta be kiddin'. This is makin' me dizzy!"
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,What a strange place. Do you think we're welcome here?
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,...sniff... sniff... This place smells good.It smells the same as Cosmo Canyon.
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,Geeeez! We got our work cut out for us.This is starting to get me really dizzy...
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"Wow, this place is huge! I'm starting to get bored."
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,No exits... We can't turn back.
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,Shit! Shit! Shit! What the hell's with this place!
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"...Cloud! I know it's going to be tough, but...Don't give up! We can do it!"
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Sealed......? That sound brings back memories.
Spirit Body,The Temple of the Ancients,Nyum... nyum...
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Whew! We finally caught up to you.I'm sorry. You waited for me.Those are the spirit bodies of the Ancients.They've been away from their Planet for a long time to protect this Temple.Over the many years, they've lost the ability to talk.Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because there was only one objective for those left in the Temple.Please, talk to me!No good. I don't understand the rest. Are you afraid...?Is it because Sephiroth is in the Temple? Or something else?"
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Phew--- We did it!
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Everyone all right? That sure took a lot out of us.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Oh no... Cloud. Come quick!!Hurry, this way!"
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"It's full of the knowledge of the Ancients.No... not knowledge... consciousness... a living soul...It's trying to say something.I'm sorry, I don't understand."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,...What's going on?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Wait! Look! It's showing us!
Elena,The Temple of the Ancients,"Tseng, what's this? Can we find the Promised Land with this?"
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,"...I wonder. Anyway, we have to report to the President."
Elena,The Temple of the Ancients,"Be careful, Tseng."
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,"Yeah...Hey Elena, how 'bout dinner after this job's over?"
Elena,The Temple of the Ancients,Th... Thank you very much.If I may be excused...
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,"Is this the Promised Land? No, it can't be..."
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,Sephiroth!!
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,So you opened the door. Well done.
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,This place... what is it?
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,A lost treasure house of knowledge. The wisdom of the Ancients...I am becoming one with the Planet.
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,One with the Planet?
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it.All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom... knowledge...I will meld with it all. I will become one with it... it will become one with me.
Tseng,The Temple of the Ancients,...you can do that?
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,The way...... lies here.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Did you see it?
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,"Yeah, I saw it."
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,...I saw it.
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,I... I saw it.
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,Oh grossness!
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,...I saw it. Tseng was in bad shape.
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,An illusion that the Ancients showed...
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,Hey hey! What's the catch?
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,...Where is the room with the pictures on the walls?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Almost there...
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,"Sephiroth is here, right?No matter what he thinks, it's going to end here.I'm taking him out!"
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,"You mean WE are, right?"
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,"We're here too, you know."
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,Don't forget about us!
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,"I have nothing to do with it. But, I guess I'll lend a hand."
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,I wonder if he'll go down that easy?
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,......
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,All right! Guess you youngsters gotta be enthusiastic like that!
Time Guardian,The Temple of the Ancients,"I am the . Ye who seek the knowledge of the Ancients. I control the time, select your path....it is time... You may proceed."
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,This atmosphere...
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,Feels like a battle!
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,Here it comes!
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,I'm tingling with excitement.
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,Oh man! I should've stayed at home.
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,It's a battle!
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,A battle...
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,Let's do it!
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,I guess there's no way we can open it... We'll come back later.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Hey! It's locked.No good. We have to catch it!You must be tired.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,- Yeah- I want to go home
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Just hang in there. Someday we'll look back at these hard times and laugh.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Yeah. But it'll all be over soon!
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,This is the room with the murals...
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Where are you!? Sephiroth!!
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,So cold.I am always by your side.Come.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Looks like we're locked in.
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,Splendid.A treasure house of knowledge...
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,I don't understand what you're saying!
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,Look well.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,At what!?
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,At that which adds to the knowledge of...I am becoming one with the Planet.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,How do you intend to become one with the Planet?
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,"(swinging the Masamune)It's simple.Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury.The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury."
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?Injure... the Planet?
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,Behold that mural. The Ultimate Destructive Magic... Meteor.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,That'll never happen!
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Where are you!? Sephiroth!!
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Wait, Cloud!"
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud!!
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,Hey!! Cloud!!
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,"Hey, Cloud!"
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud! What's wrong!
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud! What are you doing?
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud! What's wrong with you!?
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,What are you doing?
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,What the hell is going on!
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Ha ha ha... Black Materia.Ha ha ha... Call Meteor.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud!! Get a hold of yourself!
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,...I'm... ...How should I?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,...Cloud.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Mm? What's wrong? Is something wrong?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"...It's nothing so don't worry about it.Right, Cloud! It's nothing."
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Sephiroth got away.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,"...Don't worry about it. I understood what he was saying.So this must be Meteor, right?"
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,Is it some sort of a disaster?It looks like something's gonna fall from the sky.
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,Is something going to fall from the sky?
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,Something's going to fall down?
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,I don't know what it is but...It looks like it's going to make a mess...
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"Then, we got trouble.Oh, so something's going to fall from the sky? It's going to be something big."
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,Something huge is falling from the sky?
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,I don't know what the hell it is but it's falling from the sky?Hmpf! It's not even an omen.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"...this must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying.The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor.It finds small drifting planets with its magic.And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out entirely..."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Sephiroth!?
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Any sign of Sephiroth?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,He disappeared.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,We're locked in.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,What is this?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,...There's something written on it....B.l.a.c.k...... M.a.t.e.r.i.a.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Black Materia!!
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Hey!...Black Materia.What should we do, Cloud?"
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,- Shake it- Take it- Leave it
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Wait a minute. I'll ask!
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,What do they mean?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"So, this whole building is the Black Materia?"
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!?Then no one could take it.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple.And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve a puzzle.As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too.Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,"So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller and smaller and we can take it out?"
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Yes, but there's one thing...You can only answer the puzzles inside the Temple.So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,I see... the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out of the Temple so easily...
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,"Then just leave it.If we can't take it, then neither can Sephiroth, right?"
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,"Let's just leave it, OK?"
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,"That'll be safer. If no one can else take it......Then Sephiroth can't either, right?"
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,Let's just leave it and get the hell out of here!
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"The Ancients were a mean bunch. This way, no one'll be able to get it."
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,I guess that means it's safe here.
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,Guess stuff this dangerous is best left alone?
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,No. We've got to think of a way to get it out.Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies.It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black Materia.This place isn't safe.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,So what are we going to do?
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,I heard your situation!Don't forget about me.Everything you said makes perfect sense!You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia.And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either.
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"So that means you don't trust me?But Cloud. There's really nothing else you can do.Everyone, please trust me."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,- I guess we have no choice- No way
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"All righty then! Leave it all to me!Everyone, hurry up and get outside!I'll go with you to a safe place."
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"You sure are stubborn, Cloud.Please believe me, Cloud."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,"- Hmmm, I guess I have to- How can I?"
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"Hi, Cloud. This is .I overheard the whole story!Don't forget about me.Everything you said makes perfect sense!You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia.And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either.
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"But Cloud. There's really nothing else you can do.Everyone, please trust me."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,- I guess we have no choice- No way
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"All righty then! Leave it all to me!Please hurry, you've got to get out of here!I'll be waiting at the exit!"
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"You sure are stubborn, Cloud.Please believe me, Cloud."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,"- Hmmm, I guess I have to- How can I?"
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,It's warm...This isn't good...
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud...... behind you.
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,Sorry to keep you waiting!! It's Me!!
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Cait Sith...Come on, Cloud... Say something."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,I'm not good at this.
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"Mmm, I understand. I feel the same too."
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Why don't you read our fortunes?
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"Say, that's right... I haven't done it in a while, huh?I'm so exited. Right or wrong, I'm still the same 'ol meNow, what should I predict?"
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Hmm, let's see how compatible Cloud and I are!"
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,That'll cost ya. Exactly one date!Here I go!
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,No! Tell me!I promise I won't get mad!
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,"Is that so? Then I'll tell you.Looks good. You are perfect for each other!Aeris's star and Cloud's star! They show a great future!Cloud, I'll be your matchmaker, preacher... I'll do whatever you want me to!You just call me when it all happens!Thank you for believing in me, knowing that I was a spy.This is the final, final farewell!"
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Be strong Cait Sith!!
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,She told me to 'Be strong.' I feel so happy.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,That's the Black Materia...
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,Hey! I'll keep watch here!
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,I'll wait here.
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,I'll be sittin' out here.
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,"Heh heh... this looks majorly boring, so I'll stay here."
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,I'll be looking around here.
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,"I'm gonna have a smoke out here!Ahhh!! It's really something, having a smoke at a place like this."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,"As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Mmm?Can you guys use it?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power to use it."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,You mean lots of Spiritual energy?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,That's right.One person's power alone won't do it.Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's energy...Oh yeah!The Promised Land!!
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,"The Promised Land!!No, but..."
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,He shouldn't be able to find the Promised Land.
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,"...Ah, but I have.I'm far superior to the Ancients.I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients.I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the extinction of the Ancients.And soon, I will create the future."
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,I won't let you do it! The future is not only yours!
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,"Ha, ha, ha... I wonder?Wake up!"
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Sh... shut up!
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,The... Noise...
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,"There, Cloud... good boy."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Wa...... aaaa...... aaa...
Little Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,No......!Don't be afraid--!
Sephiroth,The Temple of the Ancients,......Well done.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Cloud, are you all right?"
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,...I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth...?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Cloud... be strong, OK?"
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Urrrrrrgh... What have I done!?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud... you haven't done anything.It's not your fault.
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,I...! I'm-----!
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,Urrggggggh!!!! Cloud!!
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud!!
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud!!
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,What!? Cloud!
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,......!
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,Hey! EY!
Little Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Waaaa~!!What are you doing!?
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,Oops! This looks like I came at a bad time!I'm  No. 2. Right pleased to meet you all!
Barret,The Temple of the Ancients,"HEY! Cloud, you #$#&@!"
Tifa,The Temple of the Ancients,"Cloud, what are you doing!?"
Nanaki,The Temple of the Ancients,"Aeris, are you all right!?"
Yuffie,The Temple of the Ancients,"Aeris! Cloud, what're you doing!?"
Cait Sith,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud!! What are you doin'!!
Vincent,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud!
Cid,The Temple of the Ancients,Cloud! What the hell are you doing?
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,"Everything is white...What did I do? I don't remember anything...My memory... since when...? If everything's a dream, don't wake me."
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Cloud, can you hear me?"
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,Don't worry about it.
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"Oh...Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it?And let me handle Sephiroth."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,What is this place?
Aeris,The Temple of the Ancients,"This forest leads to the City of the Ancients... and is called the Sleeping Forest.It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor.That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the Cetra, like me, can do it."
Cloud,The Temple of the Ancients,Aeris?
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,You look like you was havin' a nightmare.How are you feeling?
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,- I seem to be OK- Not good- Don't really know
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"That's good. Man, I didn't know what was gonna happen."
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,Oh... Better keep it to yourself.
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"I guess that's right. Well, don't worry too much about it."
Tifa,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"You know, Cloud. Aeris is gone."
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,Everyone's out looking for Aeris.
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,......City of the Ancients. Aeris is headed there.
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?Hey, we're goin' too."
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Only the Ancients, only Aeris can save us from Meteor..."
Tifa,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to Aeris? If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble."
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,Sephiroth... already knows.
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?
Tifa,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Let's go, Cloud."
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,No.
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Yeah, godammit! It's 'cuz of you that Sephiroth got the Black Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!"
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,My fault?
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"I know you got problems... hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself.But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line."
Tifa,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Cloud, we came this far... Aren't you going to settle up with Sephiroth?"
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"(shaking his head)No...I'm afraid.If this keeps up, I may go crazy!I'm afraid..."
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Just a damn jackass, that's what you are...Yo, jes' think about it... How many people in this world do ya think really understand themselves?People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up.But, they go on living. They don't run away... Isn't that how it is?"
Tifa,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Cloud... you'll come with us, right? I believe in you."
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,What... am I supposed to do?Pull out of here?Pull out? ...To where?
Tifa,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,(from the next room)Cloud...
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Wait a minute, Tifa. Give him a little time.He has to decide this on his own.You believe in Cloud... right?"
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,......I'm afraid to find out the truth...? But...... why?
Innkeeper,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,You awake?Those people were so worried that they stayed by your side until you woke up.You sure do have good friends.
Tifa,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,Cloud...
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Hey, how are you?I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?Either way, you stay around here and about all you can do is worry about it.Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth... If it happens, it happens.I'll go upside your spikey white head and bring you back to normal!"
Tifa,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Cloud, it'll be all right. We're all with you."
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,But...
Barret,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it."
Cloud,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"...You're... right. ......He's right, isn't he?"
Tifa,Gongaga - Afraid to Go On,"Come on, let's go and find Aeris...?"
Excavator,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,"Welcome to Bone Village, a town for nature lovers.What do you want?"
Cloud,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,- Where is the City of the Ancients?- Do you know where Aeris is?- What are you doing?
Excavator,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,"The City of the Ancients? Oh, you must mean the Forgotten City."
Excavator,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,"Are you talking about that girl? I warned her, but she went into the Sleeping Forest anyway."
Excavator,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,We're excavating. It's like the land's telling a history of the planet.
Excavator 2,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,Excavating is a slow process. The treasures we excavate are stored in the box next to the tent. Remember that.
Excavator 3,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,"You can awaken the Sleeping Forest if you have the Lunar Harp.Once awake, they say the forest will open a road for you.The girl in pink that just went in also used a Lunar Harp to get through."
Cloud,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,- I want a Lunar Harp
Excavator 3,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,Ask the guy in the tent below.
Excavator 4,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,"We use the newest system to find buried treasure. We simulate earthquakes by using bombs, and then check the sound waves given off by the tremors."
Excavator near Forest,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,"The forest just beyond here is called the Sleeping Forest. Right now the forest is asleep and anyone who wanders in while it's asleep, it confuses. You can go in, but you may never come out...But just now, a girl in pink and a man in a Black Cape went in. You think they'll be all right?"
Head Excavator,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,The Lunar Harp is somewhere in the ground here. We could excavate it for you if you want us to.
Cloud,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,- Start diggin'
Head Excavator,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,It's not just the Lunar Harp you're after. What else are you having us dig for?
Cloud,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,- Lunar Harp- Good treasure- Normal treasure
Head Excavator,Bone Village - A Town of Excavators,All right! Then I'll lend you some of my staff. Show us where you want us to dig!
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Hey yo! Wait up.That way goes to the Mountains up north. Let's hurry and find Aeris.
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Hey, hey Cloud.If we continue this way, we'll end up in the Northern Mountains. Aeris isn't over there, right?"
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Wait!That road leads to the Northern Mountains. We have to go the other way to find Aeris.
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Ahhh--- I can't go another step!!We're looking for Aeris, right! Then why are you heading for the mountains!? What a dork!"
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Wa------it!Cloud, uh that's the road to the Northern Mountains.Aeris is waiting, let's go find her."
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Wait, Cloud.This is the road to the Northern Mountains. Don't you want to find Aeris?"
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"H...ey, Cloud.You thinkin' of going skiing? If we wanna find Aeris, we go THAT way!"
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"...Ugh....Words of the Ancients?...no good. I can't understand....Ugh, again?This stream of consciousness... Could this be the words of the Ancients...?"
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"heh, there's a bed."
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Do you think the people who used to live here used it?
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Look, there's a bed here."
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,How COOL! I can't believe we found such a soft bed in a dive like this.
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,We're in luck. There's a bed in here.
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,I wonder if the owners used this?
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Yeah, and it looks pretty comfortable."
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Yo, Cloud. Let's take a break here."
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Shall we take a break here?
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Hey, let's rest a bit. I'm tired..."
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Come on--, let's rest for a while--- I don't want to walk anymore..."
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Cloud, why don't we catch 40?"
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Maybe we should take a short nap?
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,I'm beat. Why don't we get some rest?
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,I feel it...
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Cloud, what is it?"
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Cloud... what's wrong?
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,What's wrong? Are you sick?
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Hey---, Cloud. What's your problem?"
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,What's wrong? What time is it...?
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...What's wrong?
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Do you know what TIME it is!?
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Aeris is here....and so is Sephiroth.
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Wh, what! Sephiroth!?"
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"You're saying it's not just Aeris, but Sephiroth, too?"
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,What! Sephiroth's here too!?
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,No way---! Sephiroth wasn't invited!
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Are you serious, Cloud!?"
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"...If that's true, then we're in for it."
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Wa, wa, wait a minute. You serious!?"
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,How do you know that?
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,But how can you tell?
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,How did you find out?
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Wh...why? How can you tell that kind of stuff?
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,But how can you tell that?
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...How did you find that out?
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Hey, how do you know!?"
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...it's not an excuse. I feel it in my soul.
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Then, we better get up offa our lazy asses!!"
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"If that's true, then we've got to hurry! We've got to get to Aeris!"
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Wh, ...what should we do? We must hurry to her!"
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,That means it's pretty bad... doesn't it?
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"If that's true, then we're in for it! We have to find Aeris fast!"
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"If that's true, we should hurry. Something terrible could happen at any moment."
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Shit, Cloud. We can't be sittin' around on our asses."
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...right. Let's hurry and find Aeris.
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Aeris's voice...... Coming from there?
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Aeris?
All,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Cloud!
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Stop it!!
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Stop!
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,What are you doing!
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Sto----p!
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,What are you doing!
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Stop it!
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Dumb #^%@!
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Ugh... what are you making me do.
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...Aeris.
Sephiroth,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"(arms raised)Do not worry. Soon the girl will become part of the Planet's energy.All that is left is to go North. The 'Promised Land' waits for me over the snowy fields.There, I will become a new being by uniting with the planet. As will this girl......"
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"...Shut up.The cycle of nature and your stupid plan don't mean a thing.Aeris is gone.Aeris will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry...... or get angry......What about us...... what are WE supposed to do?What about my pain?My fingers are tingling.My mouth is dry.My eyes are burning!"
Sephiroth,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,What are you saying? Are you trying to tell me you have feelings too?
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Of course! Who do you think I am!?
Sephiroth,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Ha, ha, ha...... Stop acting as if you were sad.There's no need to act as though you're angry either."
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Everyone, listen to me.I'm , ex-SOLDIER, born in Nibelheim.I came to settle up with Sephiroth."
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,What're ya tryin' to say?
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...What's going on?
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...Hmm?
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Why now?
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Why're you being so formal? Is something wrong?
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...You're right.
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,I heard that before.
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"I came here by my own free will... Or so I thought.However......To tell the truth, I'm afraid of myself....There is a part of me that I don't understand.That part that made me give the Black Materia to Sephiroth.If you hadn't stopped me, Aeris might have been......There's something inside of me. A person who is not really me.That's why I should quit this journey.Before I do something terrible."
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"...I dunno, man..."
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"...But, Cloud."
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"...All right, Cloud."
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Leave it to me!
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Watch you?...... We're all in this together!
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...I guess so.
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Well, we'll face it when it happens."
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"I don't know how Aeris tried to save the planet from the Meteor.And I guess now, we'll never know.But!We still have a chance. We must get that Black Materia back before Sephiroth uses it.Let's go."
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Which way'd that damn foo' Sephiroth go?
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Sephiroth... I wonder which way he went?
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Sephiroth... Which way did he go?
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Ummm... Which way did that Sephiroth guy go?
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,I wonder which way Sephiroth went?
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Which way did Sephiroth head?
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...Which way did that creep Sephiroth go!?
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...ugh.
Barret,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Hey, you awright?"
Tifa,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Cloud! Get a hold of yourself!!
Nanaki,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,You all right?
Yuffie,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Wait! Get a hold of yourself!
Cait Sith,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Cloud! Are you all right?
Vincent,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,...you all right?
Cid,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,"Ey, hey! You alright?"
Cloud,The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice,Hmmm...Sephiroth said to me... Head North............ past the Snow Fields......

Little Girl,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Grandpa, wake up! We have a customer!!"
Old Man,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"...smack... mff... Oh... welcome, glad you came."
Old Man,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,(on speaking to him again)You'll have a hard time selecting from all the good things we have!
Old Woman in Rocking Chair,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,My husband left 20 years ago and still hasn't come back.He should at least be at the foot of the Gaea Cliffs. It's marked with a check on the map...
Young Woman,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Grandma, don't sleep so close to the fire!"
Old Woman in Rocking Chair,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,I just get s-o comfortable.
Young Woman,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"The master is an experienced climber, you know.I've heard that he knows every corner of that Great Glacier!"
Man in Yard,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"It's nearly impossible to reach the Northern limits without a map.If you're thinkin' 'bout going to the Northern limits, you'd better take that map on the wall."
Black Surfer,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,You heard about the gnarly hill in this town? They tell me it's off limits!
White Surfer,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,What luck! We came all this way... crap!
Woman,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"We came from Costa del Sol to snowboard, but we're just about to leave!"
Man by Furnace,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Phew, what is it? Don't get too close, or it'll burn ya."

Innkeeper,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Please come again.
Woman,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Welcome! You look like a STRONG one...If you want, I could lend you an ear...?"
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,- Yeah- Not interested
Woman,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,I got bored listening to his stories.
Man in Overalls,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Am I boring you?
Woman,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,What's with you!? You make me sick!
Man in Overalls,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"If you go further North, I heard there's a Huge Crater.Something huge must've fallen from the sky a long time ago!"
Woman,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Oh yeah?
Barkeeper,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"I've heard there's a snow woman, at the Great Glacier, that hates hot springs...But I think it's just a myth to scare off visitors."
Redhead,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,I heard some guy went to the Great Glacier in the North.What an idiot. Is he thinkin' 'bout going to that hot spring?
Blond Man,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"He's probably gonna get lost in the glacier and freeze to death.No matter how well equipped he is, out there in that cold on the glacier, I give him two days at the most."
Redhead 2,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,You thinkin' of going North?
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,- That's my plan- No
Redhead 2,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Well... if you're going past this town you'll need a map.Maybe there's one left at Mr. Holzoff's house. He used to be a mountain climber.
Redhead 2,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Yeah, we really don't have anything here, but make yourself at home."
Man,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Do you know what a Cetra is?
Man 2,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"What was the Cetra......? Oh yeah, it's the same as the Ancients, right?"
Man,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Yeah, a Cetra lived in this town a long time ago.Her name was Ifalna, and she knew about a lot of things..."
Man 2,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Whadaya mean?
Man,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,I heard she was abducted by the Shinra and was taken somewhere.
Man 2,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Shinra and the Ancients... I smell somethin' fishy...
Man in Bathroom,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"WHAT YOU LOOKIN' AT!?You're a real freakazoid, aren't you?"
Woman in Bathroom,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,(later)Eyaaaaaaaaaah!!!
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Camera's ready!Then, Ifalna, please tell us about the Cetra."
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the Planet.The first ones to discover the Planet's wound were the Cetra at the Knowlespole."
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Tell us Ifalna... Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Knowlespole refers to this area. The Cetra then began a Planet-reading.
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Ifalna, what exactly does Planet-reading entail?"
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"...I can't explain it very well, but it's like having a conversation with the Planet...It said something fell from the sky making a large wound."
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Do the Ancients, rather, the Cetra, have special powers to heal the Planet?"
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"No, it's not that kind of power. The life force of all living things on this Planet becomes the energy.The Cetra tried desperately to cultivate the land so as not to diminish the needed energy..."
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Hmm, even here so close to the North Cave, the snow never melts.Is that because the planet's energy is gathered here to heal its injury?"
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Yes, the energy that was needed to heal the Planet withered away the land... then the Planet...The Planet tried to persuade the Cetra to leave the Knowlespole, but..."
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Ifalna... Let's take a break.
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,I'm all right... When the Cetra... were preparing to part with the land they loved...That's when it appeared!It looked like... our... our dead mothers... and our dead brothers. Showing us spectres of their past.
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Who is the person that appeared at the North Cave? I haven't any idea.
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"That's when the one who injured the Planet... or the 'crisis from the sky', as we call him, came."
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,You don't look well... Let's call it a day.
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Ifalna, can you comment on the thing called 'Weapon'?"
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Yes, Professor.The one the Professor mistook for a Cetra... was named Jenova. That is the 'crisis from the sky'.The Planet knew it had to destroy the 'crisis from the sky'...You see, as long as Jenova exists, the Planet will never be able to fully heal itself."
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Back then, Weapon was a weapon the Planet produced of it's own will?"
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Yes, but... There is no record of Weapon ever being used.A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and confined it.The Planet produced Weapon... But it was no longer necessary to use it."
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"So, Weapon no longer exists on this Planet?"
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Weapon cannot vanish. ...it remains asleep somewhere on the Planet.Even though Jenova is confined, it could come back to life at some time...The Planet has not fully healed itself yet. It is still, watching Jenova."
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Where is Weapon?
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,I don't know...... I can't hear the voice of the Planet well...Times... have changed. The Planet... is probably watching this situation closely.
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"...Thank you, Ifalna, that will be all for today..."
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"What are you doing, Profes...... I mean, honey?"
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Oh, I'm thinking of taping it on video. But, the video's not working right..."
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,What are you going to tape? Is there still something I haven't mentioned?
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"No, that's not it. I'm going to record my beautiful daughter.And when she's sleeping, her face... looks like an angel."
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"First, we have to figure out her name. We can take the video later!"
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"I've already decided! If it's a girl, then it'll be Aeris. That's that!"
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"You are SO selfish! But Aeris is a good name!Hee hee... it's a good name, considering it came out of that forgetful head of yours!"
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Right!? Oh, the video tape......"
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Video again? You just got through taping!
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,".........Please don't say it that way.It's our lovely daughter, both yours... and mine!Don't you want to capture her childhood on videotape?"
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"If you keep doting on her like that, she won't grow up to be strong...Aeris is different from the other children. I wonder what dangers await her...?"
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Never say that! I will protect you and Aeris no matter what!!You and Aeris are my only treasures. I'll never let you go!!
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"I feel so much better now, darling.If I hadn't met you, I......"
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Who could that--I was just about to...Damn!!How dare they intrude on our 'private time' together!
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"I'll send them away.Yes, at once!!Who the devil?"
Hojo,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Heh, heh, heh...... I've been searching for you, Ifalna... or should I say, Cetra!Long time no see, Professor Gast!"
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Hojo... How did you know?
Hojo,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Believe me, I had to turn over a stone or two to find you.Two years I waited... That's how much I wanted this new sample...... Ha, ha, ha."
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,...New sample? You don't mean Aeris!?
Hojo,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Hmm, Aeris? What a nice name...... Ha, ha, ha."
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"That's it! I'm severing all ties with the Shinra.Hojo, please leave."
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Please, Aeris has nothing to do with it! All you want is me, right?"
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Ifalna!
Hojo,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"I'll need all of you for my experiment.You understand don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the future of the Planet!"
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Don't worry, Ifalna. I'll take care of this!"
Hojo,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Please don't put up a fight. I don't want any harm to come to my precious sample.Mmm? What a funny looking camera. Guard! Destroy it!
Hojo,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Be careful with her!! Ha, ha, ha......"
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Wh... what are you doing, Professor!?"
Gast,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Ifalna! Take Aeris and run!!
Ifalna,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Eyaaaaaah... Darling......!!
Hojo,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Oh, and uh... don't forget the child!Hmm, a video? The Ancients... Weapon!?Heh, heh, heh... a mountain of treasure! Thank you Professor... Ha, ha, ha"
Man in Thicket,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"No, don't!! It's a steep downgrade, past here.It's dangerous, please don't go!"
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,- I'm still going- Thanks for your kindness
Man in Thicket,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Damn, I was just being nice...What the? Who are those people over there? Looks like trouble!"
Man in Thicket,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"No, no. I just did what came natural.All right, I'm not too busy now. Do you want me to teach you how to ride a snowboard?"
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,- Maybe you should- Not interested
Man in Thicket,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Do you want me to explain again?
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"- Yes, please- No thanks"
Man in Thicket,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,You're so boring!
Elena,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"There they are, hurry!!"
Soldiers,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Yes ma'am!!
Elena,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Cloud... huff... wheeze.I won't let you go any further!
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,What's down there?
Elena,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,It's a SE-CR-ET.It really doesn't matter! But you really got guts doin' my boss in like that!
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,You mean Boss...... Tseng? That wasn't us. Sephiroth did it.
Elena,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"No! Don't think you can fool me, liar!"
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,I'm not lying... it was Sephiroth.
Elena,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Don't try to act innocent. I'll never forget it!!
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Oh, man..."
Elena,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Looks like talking alone won't cut it. You're going to have to feel some pain!
Soldier,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Just you... and me!!
Elena,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"No, I can handle him! There's no way he can avoid my punch."
Soldier,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,What? Yeah......
Soldier,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Ele... Elena!?
Man in Thicket,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,What the...? They sure were weak for Shinras.
Elena,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Why? Why didn't you try to avoid it...There's no way they can climb the Great Glacier anyway.Put them in some house in the village.
Soldiers,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,This village is now under martial law!
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,- (Do what you're told)- (Kick his butt)
Soldier,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Don't be angry. I'm just doing my job.
Soldier,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Stop it, there're kids around!Listen, I probably shouldn't tell you, but I hear something big's going down up North.The President's gonna be there. So, would you please just lay low for a while?"
Girl Sledding,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Who is that man?
Man on Roof of Small House,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"When I first moved here, I saw a man with a Black Cape heading North.It seemed strange seeing a Black Cape against the snowy white."
Woman,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,My boy got hurt right about the time we moved here...I never should've bought him a snowboard.
Boy,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"......whimper...... weep...I got hurt on my snowboard, and now I can't go out for a while...Hey, I'll give you my snowboard."
Boy,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Tell me when you get good at it.
Man in Thicket,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"Sorry I just took off a while ago... It looked like there was going to be trouble.Anyhow, you'll need a snowboard to get down that hill. Want me to teach you how to ride one?"
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"- Yeah, maybe you should- No, not interested"
Man in Thicket,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Do you want me to explain again?
Cloud,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"- Yes, please- No thanks"
Man in Thicket,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,"All right, big-head... But don't blame me if you get hurt."
Man in Thicket,Icicle Inn - Aeris's Birthplace,Be careful!
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Ugh...
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Of course.
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Yeah, somehow."
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Got snow in my ear...
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,God! I can't stand it!
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,A little off.
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Yeah, I'm all right."
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I can't be doin' this! Damn!
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"So where did we land?
Depending on the course they took,  will say any of the following:
Seems like it didn't end up being such a big jump...Seems like maybe we didn't even jump at all...We've jumped pretty far...Looks like we've jumped pretty far...

BarretHey, what's that!? They just gave you something, right? Let's use the [] button to find out.
TifaOh yeah, we got the map, right? Let's look at the map by pressing the [] button.
YuffieAt times like these, we need the map! Let's open it with the [] button.
Cait SithThen, let's look at the map. Just open it with the [] button.
VincentWe should check it on the map. Press the [] button.
CidQuick! The map, the map! Look at it with the [] button!

It sure is cold. We'll freeze if we stay here any longer.
In the Frostbite Cave...
Looks like trouble.- We're outta here!- Wait a minute!
Choosing ""We're outta here,""  does some fancy footwork and ends up outside of Great Glacier entirely.
There is a cave within the mountains where they find a woman in blue. If  speaks to her without going to the hot springs...
Woman in Blue...Please leave.Please don't worry about me.Now, I don't want to harm any of you.And don't come back again.Please stop it.Please, that is enough.
At the hot springs...
This is the only place not frozen.- Touch it- Let's go on
Hmm, a hot spring.
Having gone to the hot springs,  and the others may return to the woman in the mountain cave.
Woman in BlueYeeew... You got a lot of nerve trying to touch me with the same dirty hands that touched that filthy hot spring!I'll never forgive you.

If they defeat the Snow woman...
Woman in BlueWhy this...?
The woman collapses.
Received ""Alexander"" Materia!


If they lose to the Snow woman...
Woman in BlueHah, Just remember your place!
 wakes to find himself in Holzoff's house. If he returns to face her again:
Woman in BlueHuh, still don't get it, huh?

Travelling into the northern reaches of the glacier, they end up on seemingly endless snowfields.
...Snow... as far as you can see... Better watch where I walk....I'll place a landmark, and start walking.

If  makes it to Holzoff's house on his own...
HolzoffNow, this is a surprise!!How many years has it been since I last saw anyone here...?Oh, excuse me! My name is Holzoff. I've lived here for 20 years now.You mind listening to the stories of a lonely climber?Why don't we go to the next room and sit down.


If  collapses before reaching the house...
 wakes to find himself in Holzoff's house.
HolzoffYou awake?You collapsed at the Great Glacier. It's a miracle you're all right.
 scratches his head.
HolzoffMy name is Holzoff. I've been living here 20 years now.If you are planning to head North, you'd better listen to my story.Why don't we go to the next room and sit down.

They go into the next room and sit down.
HolzoffYou ever hear about those who challenged the cliff?
- Yeah- No

Yeah
HolzoffThe first time my friend Yamski and I tried to climb the cliff was 30 years ago.


No
HolzoffThere's an old legend that says something fell from the sky here a long time ago.That's what's supposed to have pushed the land up and formed this cliff.30 Years ago, Yamski and I took this cliff on to see what was on the other side.

HolzoffBut, we weren't prepared for it. We did expect the temperature to be low but...On that cliff, there's always a biting cold wind. The cold air lowers your body temperature.Yamski, was below me. He cut his own rope......and I didn't even notice...Ever since then, I've settled here... continuing to challenge the cliff, and provide warning and shelter to my fellow climbers.If you're going to climb the cliff, there's 2 precautions you'll need to take.First, check your route... It's hard to find because of all the snow.Second, once you get to a ledge, make sure you warm yourselves up.Understand?
- One more time- Yes
HolzoffYou must've used a lot of energy getting up here... Better get some rest before you head out.
 and the others spend the night. If  speaks to Holzoff again:
HolzoffTo climb this cliff you must check your route.And you have to keep your body temperature normal. Don't forget these things.Like to rest a little?
- Oh yeah- No, thanks
Holzoff (if  answers no)Don't over do it.
Everyone gathers outside, facing the cliffs ahead.
BarretYou know, I've been thinkin'...?
- What is it?- Save it for later
Barret...Seein' a place like this, makes you realize how awesome nature is.But, if anyone ever told me to live here, I'd tell them to... you know...I'll tell you one thing though, If I did have to live here I'd change things around 'n' make it better.I guess the total opposite of this would be...... Midgar.When you think of it that way, Shinra don't seem so bad...Uuuuuuurrrrrgh!!What the hell am I sayin'!? The Shinra, not bad!?
We'll secure the route. You come up later.
BarretY'know... standing here like this...Kinda makes you feel like the Planet's not on our side, don't it?Of course we can't even compete. I mean... The Planet don't even notice us humans...
TifaThis blizzard's nothing! I gotta say that or... brr...
NanakiI wonder what's at the top of that cliff? Well we shall see...
YuffieBrrrr, I can't take this cold!!
Cait SithThis is secret info, but... Rufus's going to arrive here, too.
VincentI wonder what's on the other side of the cliff...
CidDamn! If I could just get back in the air, this cliff would be nothing!
 and the others scale Gaea's Cliffs. In a tunnel near the top of the cliffs, they come across one of the clones.
CloneUgh...... Errgaahh!!
It collapses and disappears.  runs through the tunnel and encounters into a two-headed dragon. After defeating it,  and the others continue through the tunnel and reach the top of Gaea's Cliffs. They look over the edge at the crater, and then start down the slope.  pauses a short way down.
An old crater...Something fell out of the sky and crashed down here......Leaving a scar on the planet.

BarretSo all this energy's gathered here for the planet to heal itself?
TifaSo the planet has gathered all this energy here to heal itself?
NanakiThe energy of the planet is concentrated here.It is slowly healing its old wound.
YuffieEven I know what's going on. The energy's bein' gathered here to heal the gash.
Cait SithIt's trying to heal its wound by gathering all that energy here.
VincentIt's amassed a vast amount of energy to heal itself.
CidDamn, this's somethin'. It's gathered all that energy to try an' heal itself.

Sephiroth took that energy and is trying to use Meteor.Next time the wound won't be so small.
They continue down the slope.
Clone...b, back... to... Sep...... i... roth...
Further down, they come to the edge of Whirlwind Maze.

If Tifa is in the party...
TifaThe time has come to settle things with Sephiroth, huh?
 nods.
TifaI, too, have lost many things because of Sephiroth.Let's go!


If Tifa is not in the party...
Tifa, wait for me!!Please take me with you. You're going to have it out with Sephiroth, aren't you?
 folds his arms in thought, and Tifa turns away.
TifaBecause of Sephiroth, I, too, have lost many things, so please take me along.Don't say no. Okay?......
It can't be helped......
One of the others stays behind:

BarretThe rest is up to you!
NanakiI'm going to call everyone.
YuffieAre you saying you don't like me?
Cait SithI'll gather everybody, so you go on ahead.
VincentDon't be caught off guard...... Sephiroth may be near.
CidMan, I sure am thankful. Wanna rest a while?

They move on through the maze. Reaching the first wind wall,  looks up.
That's......!!!

Above them flies the Highwind, with a full compliment of Shinra executives assembled on the bridge.
RufusSo, I finally found you.
ScarletKyaa haa hah.Kyaa haa hah.haa hahhaa......... hahThis is incredible......
HeideggerThis is the Promised Land the President has been searching for!!
RufusBut, I'll be the one who gets it.Sorry, old man.
HojoHeh heh heh......That land is no one's.It's where the Reunion will take place...... They will all gather here......I wonder if we'll see...... Sephiroth?

Back to  and the first wind wall. Two clones attempt to cross it, and are knocked back.
TifaWe need to cross when the wind is calm, or we'll get swept off!
Clonesuph... Se... phi... roth...wh-... who---a
Beyond the first wind wall, roughly a dozen Sephiroth clones make their way in a line towards the second wind wall, many collapsing before they reach it. Beyond the second wall,  comes upon Sephiroth cutting down the clones.
SephirothThis is the end... for all of you.
Sephiroth!!!This is the end!
SephirothYou're right. This is the end of this body's usefulness.
He disappears and the screen tints red.
He disappeared!?
TifaHe might still be nearby......
Our purpose is to deliver the Black Materia to our master.
Our...?

BarretHe got away?
NanakiI feel something... danger?
YuffieI was just getting into it!
Cait SithVanished?...That can't be!
VincentStay on alert. You never know when Sephiroth might appear.
CidHey, hey,! What's goin' on?

Those who carry Jenova's cells...
Master...!?
Of course... Sephiroth.Heh, heh, heh...
Sephiroth leaps down from above and knocks them all to the ground.  slowly gets to his feet, and they enter a battle with Jenova∙DEATH. Afterwards, the Black Materia is left lying on the ground.
Jenova's cells......hmm. So that's what this is all about.The Jenova Reunion...
TifaNot Sephiroth!? You mean all this time it wasn't Sephiroth we've been after?
I'll explain later. Right now, the only thing I'm thinking about is beating Sephiroth.
TifaBut Sephiroth is......
He's here. The real Sephiroth is just beyond here.It's both incredibly wicked and cruel...But it's releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within this planet's wound.
He walks forward to pick up the Black Materia.
...The Black Materia is back in our hands.Now all we have to do is defeat Sephiroth and that'll be the end of it.
TifaWe'd better not take the Black Materia any further. Why don't you give it to someone else to hold on to?

NanakiWhat's happening, ? That wasn't Sephiroth!
YuffieWhat!? You mean that wasn't Sephiroth? All that time I was following this... thing?
Cait SithYou serious!? That's not Sephiroth!
VincentYou mean... we weren't in pursuit of Sephiroth...?
CidHoo-boy...

YuffieI don't want anything to do with that Black Materia!
Cait SithNo, not the Black materia, please.
VincentHow about if you hold on to the Black Materia?
I don't think I can...
CidMe and Black Materia just don't mix.

 gives the Black Materia to Barret.
BarretDamn, man! ...Pressure's on now.


 gives the Black Materia to Nanaki.
NanakiYou want me to take the Black Materia? ......all right, I understand.

Don't give it to ANYONE. I'm counting on you.
BarretSephiroth...... What a damn crazy #*&^%.
Nanaki, be careful!
YuffieShouldn't we hurry? The real Sephiroth is still close, right?
Cait SithSomething feels rea---lly weird here!
VincentYou never know when Sephiroth may show up... so don't let your guard down.
CidLet me catch some shut-eye.
TifaLet's find Sephiroth!!
We're going in first! You guys stay and keep watch.

BarretI'll take care of the Black Materia. No matter what happens, I'll be right here.
NanakiI'll protect the Black Materia no matter what!

 moves on past the final wind wall and suddenly everything goes white.
TifaWhat is this? What happened?
Calm down, Tifa.Sephiroth is near. Anything could happen.
The surroundings change to Nibelheim.  and the others stand at its gates.
TifaNibelheim...

BarretWhy Nibelheim!? Are you high on Mako or something?
NanakiBut, why!? A dream? An illusion?
YuffieBut why Nibelheim? This is freaky, REALLY freaky!
Cait SithBut Tifa! Isn't this an illusion?
Vincent...Why...... is it an illusion?
CidWhat the hell? Why Nibelheim!?

This is an illusion Sephiroth made up.He's trying to confuse us.It'll be all right. As long as we know it's an illusion, there's nothing to be afraid of.Come on, let's keep going.
TifaYeah, you're right...Look!!
They turn around and run aside as Sephiroth walks up to the gates. He turns to someone behind him.
SephirothAll right, let's go.
Two soldiers and a man with spiky black hair follow Sephiroth into Nibelheim.

BarretThat ain't ... The hell is he?
Nanaki's not here... I wonder who...... this is...?
YuffieHuh---! 's not here.
Cait Sith, something's strange here. Who is this guy?
Vincent...It's not . Who is this man?
Cid's not here......

Tifa shakes her head, and the others turn to look at her.
TifaStop... Sephiroth.
This is so stupid...
A flash, and Sephiroth and the others vanish.

BarretHow the hell're we gonna get outta here?
NanakiIs this illusion going to continue forever? How do we get out of it?
YuffieI don't want to be in an illusion. Let's get back to the real world!
Cait SithCome on, we have to hurry back to the real world!
VincentNow, how can we get out of here...?
CidHey, . Let's get back to the real world, huh.

Tifa... It's just an illusion.Don't worry about it...
Another flash of white.
What's... next?
TifaStop it already!!
A burning Nibelheim fades into view.

BarretThis is bad... Just like Corel.
NanakiThis is terrible... Did Sephiroth do this?
YuffieWow...... I didn't know it was THIS bad...
Cait SithThis is insane...
Vincent...All this... while I was sleeping...
CidThis is terrible...

...This is what actually happened five years ago.But...It's probably not me that's going to come out of the Shinra mansion.He's going to try and show us another stupid illusion.
The black-haired SOLDIER runs out of the mansion.
See... didn't I tell you?
The SOLDIER shakes his head and walks closer to the burning buildings.
ZanganHey it's you! You're still sane, right?
The SOLDIER nods.
ZanganThen come over here and help me!
The SOLDIER runs over to help Zangan.
TifaI don't want to... watch this. ... don't watch.
ZanganI'll check this house. You check that one over there!
He runs into one of the houses.
...What's wrong, Tifa? I told you before, right?As long as we know that it's just an illusion, there's no need to be scared.
The screen goes white and  and the others find themselves in the midst of the burning town square. Nearby, the man with the camera lies motionless.

BarretHey, you awright!?Damn! This was an illusion.
NanakiYou all right!!We were in an illusion...
YuffieHe... hey, you! You alright!?Oh, a dream! But it felt so real...
Cait SithEveryone Ok?Umm...this was a hallucination.
Vincent...You all right?Hmm... it was an illusion.
CidHe...hey you!You alright!?

Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say!That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago.That's it, isn't it?
A flash, and Sephiroth appears before them.
SephirothI see you finally understand.
What you are trying to say is that you want to confuse me, right?But... even making me see those things won't affect me.I remember it all. The heat of the fire... the pain in my body... and in my heart!
SephirothOh, is that so?You are just a puppet... You have no heart... and cannot feel any pain...How can there be any meaning in the memory of such a being?What I have shown you is reality. What you remember, that is the illusion.
Everyone...
Sephiroth...Do you understand?
I don't want to understand.But, I want to ask you one thing. Why... why are you doing this?
SephirothHa, ha, ha......I want to take you back to your real self.The one who gave me the Black Materia that day...Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so useful?Hojo would die if he knew.
Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!?
SephirothFive years ago you were......constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim was burnt.A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the power of Mako.An incomplete Sephiroth-clone. Not even given a number. ...That is your reality.Ha, ha, ha......
Tifa... Don't listen to him...Close your ears! Close your eyes!
What's wrong, Tifa? I'm not affected by it....I wasn't paying attention to him.
TifaAll that talk of Hojo constructing you is a lie.Don't we have our memories together?Being kids together, starlit nights...
SephirothHa, ha, ha... Tifa...Why are you so worried and scared by those words?Hmm... Shall I show everyone here what's in your heart?
Tifa turns away from both him and .
SephirothHa, ha, ha... You look like you're not feeling well.
He disappears.
...Tifa? Is Sephiroth right?
Tifa...
Why are you so scared? Don't worry about me. I'm all right.No matter how confused I am, I'll never believe a word that Sephiroth says.It's true that sometimes I can't figure out who I am.There's a lot of things muddled up in my memories.But, Tifa......But you said, 'Long time no see, ' right?Those words will always support me.I am the one you grew up with. I'm  of Nibelheim.No matter how much I lose faith in myself, that is the truth.That's why you shouldn't be so scared.No matter what anyone else says to me, it's your attitude that counts...
TifaNo, that's not true, ......
What's not? Aren't I the same  you grew up with?
TifaThat's not what I mean... I don't know how to say it..., I need some time... Just give me a little time...
A flash and Sephiroth appears beyond the fire.
Sephiroth... Don't blame Tifa.The ability to change one's looks, voice, and words, is the power of Jenova.Inside of you, Jenova has merged with Tifa's memories, creating you.Out of Tifa's memory......A boy named  might've just been a part of them.
He disappears in another flash.
Tifa...Please... don't think right now.
Sephiroth reappears closer to them.
SephirothHa, ha, ha...... Think, !...? Ha, ha, ha...... Oh, excuse me. You never had a name...
Shut up... Sephiroth.
SephirothYou still don't understand? Then...
He turns away and laughs.
Do you remember the picture that we took before we headed for Mt. Nibel?...Tifa, you remember, right?But there is no way he would know.Now... what happened to that picture?
He walks over to the motionless camera man.
......is this it?...Do you want to see it? It turned out pretty good.
Tifa... don't...
I... should be in the picture.Even if I'm not in there, no worry. This is just an illusory world Sephiroth made up.
 walks over to look at the photo. The black-haired SOLDIER is standing where  should have been. Once he looks, Sephiroth is gone.
...Just as I thought.This picture's a fake. The truth is in my memory....Five years ago, I came back to Nibelheim, to inspect the reactor. I was sixteen.The town hadn't changed at all. What did I do...? Oh yeah...I saw my mom. I saw the people in town.Yeah, I went to Tifa's room. There, I...I played the piano!I looked in the drawers!I read the letter addressed to Tifa!I spent the night and went to the reactor in Mt. Nibel. I was excited about it.Because that was my first mission after becoming First Class in SOLDIER.
Flash.
...SOLDIER, First Class?
He shakes his head.
...SOLDIER? When did I enter SOLDIER?
He clutches his head.
How did I join SOLDIER?
He falls to his knees.
Why... why can't I remember?I'm... I'm...
He gets back to his feet.
That's right......I didn't have to worry about it, because I was...
The screen fades to black.
Tifa......?
Let's go, Tifa. I'm... I'm all right.

Meanwhile, the Shinra have arrived at the center of the crater.
ScarletWow!! That's amazing!It's all Materia!!
RufusThe outside is rich with mako energy. The inside is a treasure trove of Materia. This truly is the Promised Land.
HojoThere is no such thing as the Promised Land. it's a legend... an old wives tale...... it's utterly ridiculous.
RufusEverything's as I imagined it to be. Isn't it splendid?It is that kind of dullness that makes you a second-rate scientist.
The ground starts quaking.
RufusWhat's happening?
ScarletIt's coming from within the wall! Something's in there! It's moving!
A huge eye in the wall opens and closes.
HojoWeapon...Then it really does exist... I didn't believe in it.
RufusWhat does this mean?
Hojo...Weapon. Monsters created by the Planet.It appears when the Planet is in danger, reducing everything to nothingness.That's what was stated in Professor Gast's report.
RufusI never saw that report... Where is it?
Hojo taps his head.
HojoHere, right here.
RufusYou keep a lot of things to yourself.

Back with who  left guarding the Black Materia...

BarretAre  and the others awright?But what's up with that? One little piece of materia, destroying the planet...
NanakiI wonder how  and the others are...It's hard to believe... such a small piece of materia is able to destroy the Planet...

Suddenly the others disappear and the background becomes a roiling green.

BarretWhat the......?The hell was that?H, huh!?Hey... Guys!Where are we? Where did we end up?
NanakiWhat the!?Is everyone all right?What's going on?Where am I!? Don't leave me alone!

Tifa comes running up.
TifaBarret, you're here! I'm so glad!!
Or:
Nanaki, you're here! I'm so glad!!
The background returns, but still no one else is there.

BarretTifa!!Something's weird here! It got pitch black all of a sudden, and everyone disappeared!
NanakiTifa!!Something is strange... Why was it dark all of a sudden and where is everybody?

TifaEveryone's waiting! 's in trouble!Please come. Help us!Over there!

BarretYea... yeah!I don't know what's goin' on, but let's just get on with it.
NanakiR, right!I'm not sure I understand... but I'll go if you want me to.

Barret or Nanaki nods to Tifa and runs off in the indicated direction.
Tifa......hee hee hee... And remember...
Tifa's image morphs into Sephiroth.
Sephiroth...the Black Materia!
He disappears, and the others are visible again, lying unconscious.

Back to the Shinra...
ScarletMr. President... I've got a bad feeling about this place...
RufusHmm... maybe we should go back to our ship now.We need to prepare for the inspection anyway.
A flash, and  his party appear among them.
ScarletHey!!! Where did you come from?
...don't know...This place is going to get rough.Better leave things to me and get out of here while you still can!!
RufusLeave things to you? Hmph... I don't know what you mean.
This is where the Reunion is happening. Where everything begins and ends.
Tifa!!

BarretHey! We're here to help you!
NanakiI'm here! I'm here to help you, !

 clutches his head and slowly walks towards Barret or Nanaki.
Thanks... Barret. Where's the Black Materia?
Or:
Thanks... Nanaki. Where's the Black Materia?
Tifa!!

BarretIt's safe. I have it.
NanakiIt's safe. I'm holding on to it.

I'll take it from here. Give me the... Black Materia.
TifaYou can't hear my voice?

BarretYou alright?
NanakiAre you all right, ?

 nods.

BarretOkay then, here. Had a lot of pressure holding this thing.
NanakiThen... here you go. I was a little apprehensive holding this thing.

TifaNo, don't!!! Please! Stop !
Thanks. ......leave the rest to me
Sephiroth's face is visible for a fraction of a second, and the screen goes white momentarily.
Come on. The Black materia...
Please wait! Just a little longer!!
Everyone, thanks for everything. And... I'm sorry.
He looks to each his party in turn.
...Sorry....Sorry.Especially you, Tifa. I'm really sorry.You've been so good to me...... I don't know what to say...I never lived up to being ''.Tifa...... Maybe one day you'll meet the real ''.
Tifa shakes her head and falls to her knees.
HojoHa, ha, ha... this is perfect!!!It means that my experiment was a complete success.What number were you? Huh? Where is your tattoo?
Professor Hojo... I don't have a number.You didn't give me one because you said I was a failed experiment.
HojoWhat the--? You mean only a failure made it here?
Professor... please give me a number. Please, Professor...
HojoShut up, miserable failure...
 flies up into a tangle of branches above them.
RufusWho... was that?
Hojo...He's a Sephiroth-clone I created after the real Sephiroth died five years ago.Jenova cells and Mako, with my knowledge and skills, have been combined with science and nature to bring him to life....I'm not wild about the failure part, but the Jenova Reunion Theory has now been proven.You see, even if Jenova's body is dismembered, it will eventually become one again. That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion.I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have passed, and now the Clones have begun to return.I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where Jenova is stored.But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself began to move away from the Shinra Building.But being a genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it was all Sephiroth's doing.Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the Lifestream; he wants to manipulate the Clones himself.
Yes, that was how it got started.
HojoI wondered where the clones were going, but I was never able to figure it out.
I couldn't figure it out, either.
Below, the third party member runs over to Tifa and helps her up.
HojoThe one thing that I did know was that Sephiroth was at their final destination.
I wasn't pursuing Sephiroth.I was being summoned by Sephiroth.All the anger and hatred I bore him, made it impossible for me to ever forget him. That and what he gave me.
 stands.
Sephiroth? Sephiroth? I'm here. And I brought you the Black materia.Show yourself to me. Where are you?Sephiroth... So we finally meet again.
At the center of the tangle of branches, Sephiroth's body is encased in a huge crystal, his eyes closed.
HojoDid you see it!! It's Sephiroth! So he IS here!This is perfect! Both Jenova's Reunion and Sephiroth's will!They won't be diffused into the Lifestream,but gathered here! Mwa, haa, ha,......
TifaWhat are you so happy about, Professor? You know what this means, don't you? has the Black Materia!Sephiroth is going to summon Meteor! Every single person is going to die!
RufusWhatever I say now is too little... too late...... We must evacuate.I want you all to come with me. There is still much more I want to hear.

BarretYo! ! Stop! Knock it off!
Nanaki, NO! Stop! Please!

Tifa------!!
 gives the Black Materia to Sephiroth. Below, the others run for the Highwind, leaving him behind, and the airship pulls away from the Northern Crater as the Planet's Weapons explode from hiding.

Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Hey, what's that!? They just gave you something, right? Let's use the [] button to find out."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Oh yeah, we got the map, right? Let's look at the map by pressing the [] button."
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"At times like these, we need the map! Let's open it with the [] button."
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Then, let's look at the map. Just open it with the [] button."
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,We should check it on the map. Press the [] button.
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Quick! The map, the map! Look at it with the [] button!"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,It sure is cold. We'll freeze if we stay here any longer.
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Looks like trouble.- We're outta here!- Wait a minute!
Woman in Blue,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"...Please leave.Please don't worry about me.Now, I don't want to harm any of you.And don't come back again.Please stop it.Please, that is enough."
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,This is the only place not frozen.- Touch it- Let's go on
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Hmm, a hot spring."
Woman in Blue,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Yeeew... You got a lot of nerve trying to touch me with the same dirty hands that touched that filthy hot spring!I'll never forgive you.
Woman in Blue,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Why this...?
Woman in Blue,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Hah, Just remember your place!"
Woman in Blue,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Huh, still don't get it, huh?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"...Snow... as far as you can see... Better watch where I walk....I'll place a landmark, and start walking."
Holzoff,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Now, this is a surprise!!How many years has it been since I last saw anyone here...?Oh, excuse me! My name is . I've lived here for 20 years now.You mind listening to the stories of a lonely climber?Why don't we go to the next room and sit down."
Holzoff,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You awake?You collapsed at the Great Glacier. It's a miracle you're all right.
Holzoff,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"My name is . I've been living here 20 years now.If you are planning to head North, you'd better listen to my story.Why don't we go to the next room and sit down."
Holzoff,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You ever hear about those who challenged the cliff?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,- Yeah- No
Holzoff,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,The first time my friend Yamski and I tried to climb the cliff was 30 years ago.
Holzoff,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"There's an old legend that says something fell from the sky here a long time ago.That's what's supposed to have pushed the land up and formed this cliff.30 Years ago, Yamski and I took this cliff on to see what was on the other side."
Holzoff,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"But, we weren't prepared for it. We did expect the temperature to be low but...On that cliff, there's always a biting cold wind. The cold air lowers your body temperature.Yamski, was below me. He cut his own rope......and I didn't even notice...Ever since then, I've settled here... continuing to challenge the cliff, and provide warning and shelter to my fellow climbers.If you're going to climb the cliff, there's 2 precautions you'll need to take.First, check your route... It's hard to find because of all the snow.Second, once you get to a ledge, make sure you warm yourselves up.Understand?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,- One more time- Yes
Holzoff,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You must've used a lot of energy getting up here... Better get some rest before you head out.
Holzoff,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,To climb this cliff you must check your route.And you have to keep your body temperature normal. Don't forget these things.Like to rest a little?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"- Oh yeah- No, thanks"
Holzoff,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,(if Cloud answers no)Don't over do it.
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"You know, I've been thinkin'...?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,- What is it?- Save it for later
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"...Seein' a place like this, makes you realize how awesome nature is.But, if anyone ever told me to live here, I'd tell them to... you know...I'll tell you one thing though, If I did have to live here I'd change things around 'n' make it better.I guess the total opposite of this would be...... Midgar.When you think of it that way, Shinra don't seem so bad...Uuuuuuurrrrrgh!!What the hell am I sayin'!? The Shinra, not bad!?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,We'll secure the route. You come up later.
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Y'know... standing here like this...Kinda makes you feel like the Planet's not on our side, don't it?Of course we can't even compete. I mean... The Planet don't even notice us humans..."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,This blizzard's nothing! I gotta say that or... brr...
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I wonder what's at the top of that cliff? Well we shall see...
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Brrrr, I can't take this cold!!"
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"This is secret info, but... Rufus's going to arrive here, too."
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I wonder what's on the other side of the cliff...
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Damn! If I could just get back in the air, this cliff would be nothing!"
Clone,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Ugh...... Errgaahh!!
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,An old crater...Something fell out of the sky and crashed down here......Leaving a scar on the planet.
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,So all this energy's gathered here for the planet to heal itself?
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,So the planet has gathered all this energy here to heal itself?
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,The energy of the planet is concentrated here.It is slowly healing its old wound.
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Even I know what's going on. The energy's bein' gathered here to heal the gash.
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,It's trying to heal its wound by gathering all that energy here.
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,It's amassed a vast amount of energy to heal itself.
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Damn, this's somethin'. It's gathered all that energy to try an' heal itself."
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Sephiroth took that energy and is trying to use Meteor.Next time the wound won't be so small.
Clone,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"...b, back... to... Sep...... i... roth..."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"The time has come to settle things with Sephiroth, huh?"
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"I, too, have lost many things because of Sephiroth.Let's go!"
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Cloud, wait for me!!Please take me with you. You're going to have it out with Sephiroth, aren't you?"
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Because of Sephiroth, I, too, have lost many things, so please take me along.Don't say no. Okay?......"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,It can't be helped......
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,The rest is up to you!
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I'm going to call everyone.
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Are you saying you don't like me?
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"I'll gather everybody, so you go on ahead."
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Don't be caught off guard...... Sephiroth may be near.
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Man, I sure am thankful. Wanna rest a while?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,That's......!!!
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"So, I finally found you."
Scarlet,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Kyaa haa hah.Kyaa haa hah.haa hahhaa......... hahThis is incredible......
Heidegger,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,This is the Promised Land the President has been searching for!!
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"But, I'll be the one who gets it.Sorry, old man."
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Heh heh heh......That land is no one's.It's where the Reunion will take place...... They will all gather here......I wonder if we'll see...... Sephiroth?
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"We need to cross when the wind is calm, or we'll get swept off!"
Clones,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,uph... Se... phi... roth...wh-... who---a
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,This is the end... for all of you.
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Sephiroth!!!This is the end!
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You're right. This is the end of this body's usefulness.
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,He disappeared!?
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,He might still be nearby......
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Our...?
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,He got away?
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I feel something... danger?
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I was just getting into it!
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Vanished?...That can't be!
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Stay on alert. You never know when Sephiroth might appear.
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Hey, hey,! What's goin' on?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Master...!?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Jenova's cells......hmm. So that's what this is all about.The Jenova Reunion...
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Not Sephiroth!? You mean all this time it wasn't Sephiroth we've been after?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"I'll explain later. Right now, the only thing I'm thinking about is beating Sephiroth."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,But Sephiroth is......
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,He's here. The real Sephiroth is just beyond here.It's both incredibly wicked and cruel...But it's releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within this planet's wound.
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,We'd better not take the Black Materia any further. Why don't you give it to someone else to hold on to?
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"What's happening, Cloud? That wasn't Sephiroth!"
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,What!? You mean that wasn't Sephiroth? All that time I was following this... thing?
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You serious!? That's not Sephiroth!
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You mean... we weren't in pursuit of Sephiroth...?
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Hoo-boy...
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I don't want anything to do with that Black Materia!
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"No, not the Black materia, please."
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,How about if you hold on to the Black Materia?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I don't think I can...
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Me and Black Materia just don't mix.
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Damn, man! ...Pressure's on now."
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"You want me to take the Black Materia? ......all right, I understand."
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Don't give it to ANYONE. I'm counting on you.
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Sephiroth...... What a damn crazy #*&^%.
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Cloud, be careful!"
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Shouldn't we hurry? The real Sephiroth is still close, right?"
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Something feels rea---lly weird here!
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You never know when Sephiroth may show up... so don't let your guard down.
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Let me catch some shut-eye.
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Let's find Sephiroth!!
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,We're going in first! You guys stay and keep watch.
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"I'll take care of the Black Materia. No matter what happens, I'll be right here."
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I'll protect the Black Materia no matter what!
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,What is this? What happened?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Calm down, Tifa.Sephiroth is near. Anything could happen."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Nibelheim...
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Why Nibelheim!? Are you high on Mako or something?
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"But, why!? A dream? An illusion?"
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"But why Nibelheim? This is freaky, REALLY freaky!"
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,But Tifa! Isn't this an illusion?
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,...Why...... is it an illusion?
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,What the hell? Why Nibelheim!?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"This is an illusion Sephiroth made up.He's trying to confuse us.It'll be all right. As long as we know it's an illusion, there's nothing to be afraid of.Come on, let's keep going."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Yeah, you're right...Look!!"
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"All right, let's go."
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,That ain't Cloud... The hell is he?
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Cloud's not here... I wonder who...... this is...?
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Huh---! Cloud's not here.
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Cloud, something's strange here. Who is this guy?"
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,...It's not Cloud. Who is this man?
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Cloud's not here......
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Stop... Sephiroth.
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,This is so stupid...
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,How the hell're we gonna get outta here?
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Is this illusion going to continue forever? How do we get out of it?
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I don't want to be in an illusion. Let's get back to the real world!
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Come on, we have to hurry back to the real world!"
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Now, how can we get out of here...?"
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Hey, Cloud. Let's get back to the real world, huh."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Cloud... It's just an illusion.Don't worry about it...
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,What's... next?
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Stop it already!!
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,This is bad... Just like Corel.
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,This is terrible... Did Sephiroth do this?
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Wow...... I didn't know it was THIS bad...
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,This is insane...
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,...All this... while I was sleeping...
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,This is terrible...
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,...This is what actually happened five years ago.But...It's probably not me that's going to come out of the Shinra mansion.He's going to try and show us another stupid illusion.
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,See... didn't I tell you?
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I don't want to... watch this. Cloud... don't watch.
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"...What's wrong, Tifa? I told you before, right?As long as we know that it's just an illusion, there's no need to be scared."
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Hey, you awright!?Damn! This was an illusion."
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You all right!!We were in an illusion...
Yuffie,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"He... hey, you! You alright!?Oh, a dream! But it felt so real..."
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Everyone Ok?Umm...this was a hallucination.
Vincent,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,...You all right?Hmm... it was an illusion.
Cid,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,He...hey you!You alright!?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say!That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago.That's it, isn't it?"
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I see you finally understand.
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"What you are trying to say is that you want to confuse me, right?But... even making me see those things won't affect me.I remember it all. The heat of the fire... the pain in my body... and in my heart!"
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Oh, is that so?You are just a puppet... You have no heart... and cannot feel any pain...How can there be any meaning in the memory of such a being?What I have shown you is reality. What you remember, that is the illusion."
Everyone,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Cloud...
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,...Do you understand?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"I don't want to understand.But, I want to ask you one thing. Why... why are you doing this?"
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Ha, ha, ha......I want to take you back to your real self.The one who gave me the Black Materia that day...Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so useful?Hojo would die if he knew."
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!?
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Five years ago you were......constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim was burnt.A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the power of Mako.An incomplete -clone. Not even given a number. ...That is your reality.Ha, ha, ha......"
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Cloud... Don't listen to him...Close your ears! Close your eyes!
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"What's wrong, Tifa? I'm not affected by it....I wasn't paying attention to him."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"All that talk of Hojo constructing you is a lie.Don't we have our memories together?Being kids together, starlit nights..."
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Ha, ha, ha... Tifa...Why are you so worried and scared by those words?Hmm... Shall I show everyone here what's in your heart?"
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Ha, ha, ha... You look like you're not feeling well."
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,...Tifa? Is Sephiroth right?
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Cloud...
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Why are you so scared? Don't worry about me. I'm all right.No matter how confused I am, I'll never believe a word that Sephiroth says.It's true that sometimes I can't figure out who I am.There's a lot of things muddled up in my memories.But, Tifa......But you said, 'Long time no see, ' right?Those words will always support me.I am the one you grew up with. I'm  of Nibelheim.No matter how much I lose faith in myself, that is the truth.That's why you shouldn't be so scared.No matter what anyone else says to me, it's your attitude that counts..."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"No, that's not true, Cloud......"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,What's not? Aren't I the same  you grew up with?
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"That's not what I mean... I don't know how to say it...Cloud, I need some time... Just give me a little time..."
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Cloud... Don't blame Tifa.The ability to change one's looks, voice, and words, is the power of Jenova.Inside of you, Jenova has merged with Tifa's memories, creating you.Out of Tifa's memory......A boy named Cloud might've just been a part of them."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Cloud...Please... don't think right now.
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Ha, ha, ha...... Think, Cloud!...Cloud? Ha, ha, ha...... Oh, excuse me. You never had a name..."
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Shut up... Sephiroth.
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You still don't understand? Then...
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Cloud... don't...
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"I... should be in the picture.Even if I'm not in there, no worry. This is just an illusory world Sephiroth made up."
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"...Just as I thought.This picture's a fake. The truth is in my memory....Five years ago, I came back to Nibelheim, to inspect the reactor. I was sixteen.The town hadn't changed at all. What did I do...? Oh yeah...I saw my mom. I saw the people in town.Yeah, I went to Tifa's room. There, I...I played the piano!I looked in the drawers!I read the letter addressed to Tifa!I spent the night and went to the reactor in Mt. Nibel. I was excited about it.Because that was my first mission after becoming First Class in SOLDIER."
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"...SOLDIER, First Class?"
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,......Cloud?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Let's go, Tifa. I'm... I'm all right."
Scarlet,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Wow!! That's amazing!It's all Materia!!
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,The outside is rich with mako energy. The inside is a treasure trove of Materia. This truly is the Promised Land.
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,There is no such thing as the Promised Land. it's a legend... an old wives tale...... it's utterly ridiculous.
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Everything's as I imagined it to be. Isn't it splendid?It is that kind of dullness that makes you a second-rate scientist.
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,What's happening?
Scarlet,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,It's coming from within the wall! Something's in there! It's moving!
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Weapon...Then it really does exist... I didn't believe in it.
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,What does this mean?
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"...Weapon. Monsters created by the Planet.It appears when the Planet is in danger, reducing everything to nothingness.That's what was stated in Professor Gast's report."
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I never saw that report... Where is it?
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Here, right here."
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You keep a lot of things to yourself.
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Are Cloud and the others awright?But what's up with that? One little piece of materia, destroying the planet..."
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I wonder how Cloud and the others are...It's hard to believe... such a small piece of materia is able to destroy the Planet...
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"What the......?The hell was that?H, huh!?Hey... Guys!Where are we? Where did we end up?"
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,What the!?Is everyone all right?What's going on?Where am I!? Don't leave me alone!
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Barret, you're here! I'm so glad!!"
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Tifa!!Something's weird here! It got pitch black all of a sudden, and everyone disappeared!"
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Tifa!!Something is strange... Why was it dark all of a sudden and where is everybody?
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Everyone's waiting! Cloud's in trouble!Please come. Help us!Over there!
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Yea... yeah!I don't know what's goin' on, but let's just get on with it."
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"R, right!I'm not sure I understand... but I'll go if you want me to."
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,......hee hee hee... And remember...
Sephiroth,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,...the Black Materia!
Scarlet,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Mr. President... I've got a bad feeling about this place...
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Hmm... maybe we should go back to our ship now.We need to prepare for the inspection anyway.
Scarlet,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Hey!!! Where did you come from?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,...don't know...This place is going to get rough.Better leave things to me and get out of here while you still can!!
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Leave things to you? Hmph... I don't know what you mean.
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,This is where the Reunion is happening. Where everything begins and ends.
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Hey! We're here to help you!
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"I'm here! I'm here to help you, Cloud!"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Thanks... Barret. Where's the Black Materia?
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,It's safe. I have it.
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,It's safe. I'm holding on to it.
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,I'll take it from here. Give me the... Black Materia.
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,You alright?
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Are you all right, Cloud?"
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Okay then, here. Had a lot of pressure holding this thing."
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Then... here you go. I was a little apprehensive holding this thing.
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Thanks. ......leave the rest to me
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Everyone, thanks for everything. And... I'm sorry."
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Ha, ha, ha... this is perfect!!!It means that my experiment was a complete success.What number were you? Huh? Where is your tattoo?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Professor Hojo... I don't have a number.You didn't give me one because you said I was a failed experiment.
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,What the--? You mean only a failure made it here?
Cloud,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Professor... please give me a number. Please, Professor..."
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Shut up, miserable failure..."
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Who... was that?
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"...He's a Sephiroth-clone I created after the real Sephiroth died five years ago.Jenova cells and Mako, with my knowledge and skills, have been combined with science and nature to bring him to life....I'm not wild about the failure part, but the Jenova Reunion Theory has now been proven.You see, even if Jenova's body is dismembered, it will eventually become one again. That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion.I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have passed, and now the Clones have begun to return.I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where Jenova is stored.But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself began to move away from the Shinra Building.But being a genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it was all Sephiroth's doing.Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the Lifestream; he wants to manipulate the Clones himself."
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"I wondered where the clones were going, but I was never able to figure it out."
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,The one thing that I did know was that Sephiroth was at their final destination.
Hojo,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Did you see it!! It's Sephiroth! So he IS here!This is perfect! Both Jenova's Reunion and Sephiroth's will!They won't be diffused into the Lifestream,but gathered here! Mwa, haa, ha,......"
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"What are you so happy about, Professor? You know what this means, don't you?Cloud has the Black Materia!Sephiroth is going to summon Meteor! Every single person is going to die!"
Rufus,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Whatever I say now is too little... too late...... We must evacuate.I want you all to come with me. There is still much more I want to hear.
Barret,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Yo! Cloud! Stop! Knock it off!
Nanaki,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,"Cloud, NO! Stop! Please!"
Tifa,Northern Crater - Shinra's Promised Land,Cloud------!!
Station Man,Junon - A Public Execution,What's the matter?
Cloud,Junon - A Public Execution,ohhh...
Station Man,Junon - A Public Execution,......poor kid.
Cloud,Junon - A Public Execution,Ooouugh......
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,Are you all right?
Cloud,Junon - A Public Execution,oo... uh... agh
Cloud,Junon - A Public Execution,Uh... uh... Tifa...?Tifa...?
Cloud,Junon - A Public Execution,Tifa!
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,"...............?Oh, Cloud!"
Cloud,Junon - A Public Execution,That's right. I'm .
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,"Is it really you, Cloud? I never thought I'd find you here!"
Cloud,Junon - A Public Execution,"Yeah, it's been a while."
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,What happened to you? You don't look well.
Cloud,Junon - A Public Execution,......Yeah? It's nothing. I'm okay.
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,How long has it been?
Cloud,Junon - A Public Execution,Five years.
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,............
Cloud,Junon - A Public Execution,What is it?
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,...it's really been a long time.
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,...Because I'm scared.
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Don't worry. I don't know what happened to Cloud either.Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry...None of them know if he's all right either.
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,"He's still... alive, right?"
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,How long... was I asleep?
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Lessee now...... Must've been about 7 days.
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,What about Sephiroth?
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,"You ain't over it yet. Remember that huge light, in the Northern Cave?Since then, the crater's been surrounded by a huge barrier of light.Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in that big hole, protected by the barrier.We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he wakes up.An' on topa that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on a rampage."
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,...Weapon?
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,"Remember that huge monster that was with Sephiroth, at the bottom of the crater?Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from the past."
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,Weapon... is protecting Sephiroth?
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,"Dunno. But he's up here goin' around tearin' shit up.Right now Rufus' fightin' it. I hate to say it, but he's got guts.We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but we ain't got no time..."
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,Time...... Hey! How about Meteor?
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,Do we have to give up?
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,...Dunno.
Rufus,Junon - A Public Execution,"I thought Cloud would show up to save you all...Professor Hojo wanted to check up on Cloud, too."
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,What are you going to do to Cloud?
Rufus,Junon - A Public Execution,"Sephiroth's alter ego...Meteor has been summoned... Essentially, it's all but over now.So, there's no need for you now.No, maybe there is an important task for you..."
Heidegger,Junon - A Public Execution,President! Preparations for the public execution are complete.
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Execution!?What're ya gonna get by executin' us?
Rufus,Junon - A Public Execution,You are to be executed for causing this situation.People are ignorant. They'll feel better as long as someone is punished.
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,I take back what little praise I had for this damn jackass!
Rufus,Junon - A Public Execution,"Well, enjoy your last moments together."
Heidegger,Junon - A Public Execution,I'll tie your arms now.
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,Is everyone here? These are the ones who brought this madness into the world!
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,The hell are these people?
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,We will be broadcasting your miserable deaths live on national television.
Large Man,Junon - A Public Execution,"Scarlet, why a public execution in this day and age?"
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,"With the chaos resulting from the Meteor reports, we desperately need to rally public support... it's better that we punish somebody, anybody."
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,You make me sick...
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,"Ha, ha, ha, ha!They'll never admit it, but everyone loves this stuff!We'll start with this girl."
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,If you've gotta do it... do me first!
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,"Camera, this way! Make sure you get this, the audience just eats up tearful goodbyes!"
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,What are you doing!?
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,"This is my special gas chamber. Take your time, and enjoy a slow painful death."
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,Stuck up ^%$#&!!
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,"Well now, the show's about to begin. Ha, ha, ha!"
Press Representatives,Junon - A Public Execution,Oh no! It's Weapon!Run!
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,"Hey, hey, all of you!Damn! Why now?"
Large Man,Junon - A Public Execution,"How does it feel now, Scarlet?"
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,"Hmm, so you didn't run? I'm impressed. How do I feel? Right now......Nngaaaaaahhhh!"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Huh!? Sleeping gas?
Soldiers,Junon - A Public Execution,Weirdo!!
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,(untying Barret's arms)I'm here to help!
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Why you......? Ain't you part of Shinra?
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,"Let's just say I'm against capital punishment. Besides... I hate this broad. Come on, we gotta help Tifa.I'll keep watch at the entrance."
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,......Fools...... I've already pushed... the switch...
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,It won't open!
Heidegger,Junon - A Public Execution,It's Weapon.
Rufus,Junon - A Public Execution,There's been so many attacks lately. Can we handle it?
Heidegger,Junon - A Public Execution,I believe so. Your orders?
Rufus,Junon - A Public Execution,No need to ask.
Heidegger,Junon - A Public Execution,We'll give it a shot from our big cannon.Open cannon doors!! Activate cannon. Target: Weapon!!
Sailor,Junon - A Public Execution,Preparations complete!
Heidegger,Junon - A Public Execution,The cannon...Fire----!!!
Rufus,Junon - A Public Execution,Did we get 'em?
Heidegger,Junon - A Public Execution,Seems so...
Heidegger,Junon - A Public Execution,It can't be! We hit it dead on!
Rufus,Junon - A Public Execution,How about the cannon?
Heidegger,Junon - A Public Execution,It'll take time to reload.
Rufus,Junon - A Public Execution,Then use regular fire power in the mean time!
Heidegger,Junon - A Public Execution,Yes sir! Open all artillery doors! Target: Weapon! Don't let it land!
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,"Gas!!Barret, help!!"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Hold your breath! Hold on as long as you can!
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,Come on! I can't hold on forever!
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Shi-!
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room!
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,"Hmm, we gotta go with a different plan. Let's get out of this room first."
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,"Tifa! I'll help you, I promise!"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,No! They locked this too!
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,"(from inside)Fools. Now, you can't save the girl.Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Goddammit......!!
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,"OK, OK time for Plan B. Let's run to the airport!"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Why the airport? An' leave Tifa there?
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,"Trust me, trust me. We gotta take a chance."
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,Where you goin'? The airport's the other way.
Yuffie,Junon - A Public Execution,"I know you're in a hurry! But, please if I could have a word......"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Shu'up!! I'm in a hurry!
Yuffie,Junon - A Public Execution,"Don't make so much noise...... It's me, ME! !"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,The hell you doin' here!?
Yuffie,Junon - A Public Execution,I'll explain later! Now we gotta get to the airport!
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,"Damn, man!"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Yo! You sure this is the right way? It's a dead end!
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,Uh oh? Did I make a wrong turn?
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,"You damn cat......! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all be comin' soon!Yo, better watch my back till the end... partner!"
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,Which button stops the gas...?
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,What d'you do? Hey! Open it!
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,"First you lock me in this weird place, and now you're telling me to come out? Make up your mind!"
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,"Our little game of hide and seek ends here.The execution may have been unsuccessful, but your death by falling from here and crashing into the water below still might be pretty exciting."
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,Quit slapping me! You old wench!!!
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,(as she slaps Scarlet)What!?Pay back!!Stop it!Same to you!!
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,(as she slaps Tifa)How can you!?You!!That hurts!That's enough!
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,(if she loses)God! I can't stand it!
Scarlet,Junon - A Public Execution,"Take her away.Now it's time to pay up. I'll really drop you if you don't settle down!Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,You okay?
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,"My cheeks hurt a bid.Forget about that, what's all this about?"
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,"Well, I'll catch the details later.In any case, the Airship, Highwind, is now yours."
Yuffie,Junon - A Public Execution,(lying on deck)Ha! Ha! ......urk!Well...... I'm glad you're safe.I'm going to stay up here a little longer.......Urk! ......I can't ride ships either in the air or water.
Crew Member in Operation Room,Junon - A Public Execution,Sorry!! Go speak to Captain Cid!
Crew Member outside Operation Room,Junon - A Public Execution,"My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!"
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,- Fly Airship- Chew the fat
Crew Member outside Operation Room,Junon - A Public Execution,"So things have come to this... When you want to take off, just tell the pilot on the bridge."
Crew Member outside Operation Room,Junon - A Public Execution,"......Well......... Um, what should I talk about?Wanna hear why we rebelled?"
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,- Listen- Don't care
Crew Member outside Operation Room,Junon - A Public Execution,"Working on the Highwind, we spent every day slaving under Heidegger.Whenever he got yelled at by the President, he'd immediately take it out on the crew.We put up with this all the time. Even when he beat us.I mean, I finally made it on the crew of the famous Highwind, and there's no way I was going to quit over him.Let's see, it must've been a week ago... it was my shift and we were heading towards the North Cave.Everyone, including the President and Scarlet, got on.And with them, I saw Cid, a legendary pilot!And he was looking around the inside of the ship looking really, y'know, nostalgic......He even talked to us.I couldn't believe it! I was so impressed! He was every bit as warmhearted as we'd always heard.Cid said that if he had the Highwind, things would be a lot easier.And now here we are off to save the planet. It's true. He really overwhelmed me.And that's why we decided to help.After the North Cave, we went to Junon, and I started screaming 'Fire! Fire!'In the middle of all the commotion, we stole this ship from the Shinra.That's how it happened. .......Just a minor mutiny against our leaders.But Barret and you were captured by Heidegger......We waited seven days for a chance to rescue you guys, before we finally could.So thanks to our successful mission, we were able to see you again.I hope I didn't bore you too much with that long story."
Crew Member in Chocobo Stable,Junon - A Public Execution,I'm bored...... I'd like to ride a Chocobo.
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,- How do I?- Later
Crew Member in Chocobo Stable,Junon - A Public Execution,"Listen...... you gotta ride in on a Chocobo you've raised yourselfThen, if you bring your Chocobo to this stable, I'll take care of it for you.I'll take care of it for you.what? How do you raise a Chocobo? Can't say I know much about that.If you want to know about raising Chocobo, there's a Chocobo ranch near Midgar. You should ask them."
Crew Member in Chocobo Stable,Junon - A Public Execution,Whew......
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Dammit! Why didn't ya tell me you could fly an airship!?I thought...... Tifa was gone for good.
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,"Sorry, but I had to do something to trick the enemy.Come on! Everyone is waiting!"
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,Everyone? Everyone's here?
Cid,Junon - A Public Execution,Welcome to my airship--the Highwind!
Cid,Junon - A Public Execution,What's wrong!? You should be more excited than that!
Nanaki,Junon - A Public Execution,Cid......
Cid,Junon - A Public Execution,Yeah......
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,Not enough crew.
Pilot in Training (LV3),Junon - A Public Execution,Yaaaaahh! Don't talk to me right now!
Bridge Crew Member 1,Junon - A Public Execution,"Whenever anyone talks to me, I get all nervous and mess things up!"
Bridge Crew Member 2,Junon - A Public Execution,All we have to do is just pilot. They don't have to talk to us.
Cid,Junon - A Public Execution,(after Tifa speaks to either of the crew)Hey you! What the hell are you doin'!?
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,What's that sad face for?
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,"Tifa, I'll give you information Shinra.Ask me if there's anything you don't understand."
Cid,Junon - A Public Execution,"Well, it takes all kinds."
Nanaki,Junon - A Public Execution,Do you think we aren't strong enough without Cloud?Do you think we can't save the Planet alone?
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,"Meteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage......At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do......No idea at all......"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,"Get a hold of yourself Tifa! C'mon, let's think about this!No way we can get offa this train we're on!"
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,"......If only Cloud was here, everything would be fine.Cloud would......Stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do.He'd say, 'Everything's under control, .'"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,Tifa! When'd you become such a wimp!
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,I'm sorry Barret.I'm kind of shocked myself. I'm so depressed.
Nanaki,Junon - A Public Execution,And Tifa...... the reason why we all thought it was Cloud was because......
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,......I know.That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him again.
Nanaki,Junon - A Public Execution,"Cheer up, Tifa......"
Vincent,Junon - A Public Execution,......So glad you're all right Tifa.
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,What? Does Cloud always gotta be around?.......We did fine without him in the beginning......Right? An' what happened to tough girl I used to know? Where'd she go to?
Cid,Junon - A Public Execution,"I want you to know that I didn't dislike him.Gotta admit he was a strange dude.Just when you thought he was cool, he'd go and do some damn fool thing.And when you thought he was smart, he'd show how stupid he was.Everything about him from his movements to his speech were kinda odd.Knowin' what I do now, I can see why he was that way.Well, as long as you stay alive, you just might see him again someday, so cheer up, sis."
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,......I'll be able to see him someday.
Cid,Junon - A Public Execution,"If we can find out where he is, the Highwind'll get us there in no time."
Nanaki,Junon - A Public Execution,"......MaybeCloud is still stuck deep in the North Crater, where the ground cracked and swallowed him up......Buried in the depths of the underground......"
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,Deep within the earth...... are you talking about the Lifestream?
Nanaki,Junon - A Public Execution,"The Lifestream sometimes gushes out to the surface from cracks in the ocean floor.I heard that such a place exists.Maybe, just maybe Cloud's......"
Pilot in Training (LV3),Junon - A Public Execution,Waaaaah! Captain Cid!
Cid,Junon - A Public Execution,"Tifa, sorry, but I've gotta show this moron how to land the ship.Don't worry, it'll be done in a minute.Oh, and Tifa......No matter what your goal is, you've got to be prepared.Go to your room and get ready for our operation.I put a lot of things for the operation in your room, so put them in order."
Crew Member in Operation Room,Junon - A Public Execution,"Tifa, thank you for a job well done!"
Barret,Junon - A Public Execution,"Whenever I think of Cloud, everything gets all jumbled up.No matter how powerful Shinra or Hojo is, I can't believe they can create humans.But because of them, we know that Meteor is heading towards us......Y'know, even if I saw him, I don't have a damn idea what I'd do......"
Nanaki,Junon - A Public Execution,"There appears to be a small island near the Lifestream......They said the Lifestream sometimes suddenly gushes out at the south island.I remember hearing about this from Seto when I was a child, but I don't remember much else......I'm sorry...... Tifa."
Cait Sith,Junon - A Public Execution,"Everything appears calm right now at Shinra.So now's the time to look for Cloud.I'm worried about him, too.I wonder where Cloud is. Or could he already be......"
Vincent,Junon - A Public Execution,Too much hope is the opposite of despair.An overpowering love may consume you in the end......
Cid,Junon - A Public Execution,OK! You just signal when you're ready to fly full speed.
Pilot in Training (LV4),Junon - A Public Execution,Eagggghh! Are we going?
Tifa,Junon - A Public Execution,- We're going- We're staying put
Pilot in Training (LV4),Junon - A Public Execution,Eagggggh! We're off!
Redhead,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Huh? You're looking for your friend? You want to know where the Lifestream is?Let's see, I can't help you with your friend, but I've heard about the Lifestream.When I traveled to the southern islands, a doctor was very kind to me. I seem to recall him telling me something about the Lifestream......"
Old Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Ah, youth... You really believe that big meteor filling up the sky's going to fall here?If that's the case then all we can do is put our hope in Shinra, Inc."
Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"They say the meteor is going to fall, but it's okay! I'm sure Shinra will come through for us in the end and do something!"
Girl Upstairs,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,I can't believe Meteor's really falling this way...... What's going to happen to us?
Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Oh man, oh man!A meteor's gonna fall on us, and now there's some big huge monster the likes of which I've never seen just wandering around out there!What's going to happen to all of us!!?"
Girl,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,......My older brother's so stupid. He's so embarrassing I could just puke!
Boy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"I'm gonna hurry up and get strong so I can crush the meteor to bits! But I gotta train real hard to do it.Hyah, hayah, eagghh!"
Man in Blue,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"The meteor's going to fall, isn't it? Unless Shinra does something about it, then we're all history!"
Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,I want you to stop that talk about a Meteor falling on us!
Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Even if Meteor falls, If you're in Midgar, you ought to be safe.They say it's a ""Mako Metropolis"" so they should survive somehow......"
Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"The meteor's coming, right? Where am I going to stash my money...? Wait, maybe I'd better take it with me and get out of here!"
Kalm Traveler,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"The world's changed a lot in the past few days......That huge monster Meteor was covering up the sky and acting like he owned it or something...A lot of my friends have died......I'm goin' on a journey to pray for their souls.A map that was sunk along with the ship. ...... ""Guidebook""A rose that blooms once every 1000 years in the desert. ...... ""Desert Rose""A harp that soothes those who hear it. ...... ""Earth Harp""I wonder if there's anyone who'll bring it to me?"
Kid outside Bar,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"My dad still just sits at the bar drinking, even though he knows that Meteor's coming!It's sad. Even though he's an adult, he just doesn't want to see the world as it really is. I dunno what to do."
Person in Blue,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"And all of Midgar's gonna be destroyed by a falling meteor? Oh, don't make me laugh!Lately, there's been a number of scary incidents. I hate it. Just hate it!"
Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Listen, I've worked hard till now... and you say Meteor's gonna smash everything to bits?Well, I ain't standin' around listenin' to fool talk like this. Makes a person lose the will to work, that's what it does!What're ya, dense? Something like that'll never happen? It's ridiculous!"
Bartender,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,I heard Shinra's taking all its biggest artillery from Junon and its various other facilities and gathering it in Midgar to fight the meteor and Weapon.What's going to happen to the world...?
Man in Blue,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,(checking the Mako pressure)What're you doing checking the pressure of the Mako energy at a time like this? It's probably already too late......It's times like this when you shouldn't go into a tail spin. You've got to continue to live orderly just like before.At least that's what I think...
Choco Bill,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Oh, what is that? What has this world come to? Stars falling and everything.With things the way they are now, how 'bout raising a Chocobo?No, I'm not trying to persuade you for money. It's just because of the state of things in the world.I thought that it would be a good and healthy thing for you to raise some Chocobos...Hmm... You just happen to be in luck!It just so happens that we aren't taking care of any Chocobos for anyone else, so...I could take care of 6 Chocobos right now, for 10000 gil per Chocobo. How 'bout it?"
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- Could you take care of the chocobos?- I'd like to hear about something else- Tell me how you raise them- That's all
Choco Bill,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"To raise a Chocobo, you'll need a 'Chocobo Stable'.And they rent for 10000 gil. Currently, I can rent out up to 6 'Chocobo Stables'.If you rent a 'Chocobo Stable', we will keep up to 4 of the Chocobos you catch in the fenced area outside.At a later date, you can select the Chocobo that you would like to put in your 'Chocobo Stable'.'Chocobo Stables' cost 10000 gil..."
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- Rent it
Choco Bill,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Thank you.My grandson takes care of the Chocobos. He's in the Chocobo Stable at the far right of the farm. Please tell him what you want.
Choco Bill,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Someone once told me there is a 'Chocobo Sage'... somewhere.He seems to know how to raise some great Chocobos.If he really does exist, I'd like to meet him someday."
Choco Bill,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Chocobos aren't hard to take care of.The day to day care will all be done here.But, please buy the food for the Chocobo, and feed them yourselves.Chocobo's abilities will differ with what you feed it, so feel free to choose your own food.Also, if you're able to find a male and a female Chocobo that like each other, they'll produce an egg. But only if you feed them a 'Nut'.New Chocobos inherit the abilities of their parents.I've heard that sometimes new breeds of Chocobo are born with special abilities. I've never actually seen it before, though."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Welcome!
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- Buy- Get some information- Moving Chocobos- Feeding Chocobos- Mating Chocobos- Releasing Chocobos- Riding Chocobos- Do nothing
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"- Feed?- Mating?- Chocobo by the fence?- Ride it outside?- What are ""Classes""?- Nothing"
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"What the Chocobo eats are 'Greens' The most famous one is the 'Gizzard greens.'Chocobos will mature differently depending on which 'Greens' they eat. Certain 'Greens' will boost their stamina.You'll have to figure out what kinds have what effects for yourselves.Oh, and Chocobos are born with certain natural abilities. So no matter how much they mature, they can't get more abilities than what they're born with.Remember that if a Chocobo's abilities don't increase even though you feed it, that means its limit is reached.It's best to let those kinds of Chocobo go or mate them to get a new Chocobo."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,A male and a female Chocobo together can produce an egg.
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"The Chocobo out there is part of the stock that you caught.We can only keep 4 Chocobos here at once. If you get a fifth one, the first one will have to be let go.If you don't want that to happen, come back and put it in your own stable."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Yeah, you can ride this oneAnd even if you take it outside, this Chocobo won't run away when you get off of it.If you want to return to your 'Chocobo Stable' just ride it onto the farm.Then, you'll be able to feed it again."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Chocobos 'strengths are divided by 'Class'.
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stable'If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,It looks like you haven't even caught one yet...
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"You have all the 'Chocobo Stables' you can carry.If you want to put a Chocobo in it, first, you must let it go and open a 'Chocobo Stable.'"
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Which one are you going to put in the 'Chocobo Stable'?Use the Directional button left or right and O.
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Want to put this Chocobo in your stable?
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- Put it in- Let it go- Choose a different one
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Then, give Chocobo Female/Male a name."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,I'm really going to let him go.
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"- Put it in- Go ahead- No, don't"
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stable'If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Your 'Chocobo Stable' are empty.
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,You don't have any 'Greens'... It just so happens I can sell you one...
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Which Chocobo are you going to feed it to?
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- Yeah- No- Choose another one
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stable'If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Your 'Chocobo Stable' are empty.
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,You better have a 'Chocobo Stable' prepared for the little ones too.
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Looks like you don't have any 'Nuts'... To get them to produce an egg, you need a 'Nut' Do you want me to sell you one?"
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,There's only one...
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,They gotta be male and female.
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,You shouldn't mate those that just mated or those that were just born.There doesn't seem to be any others you could mate it with.
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Which two Chocobos are you going to mate?Talk to the two you like and make your decision.
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"- Go ahead- No, I changed my mind"
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Which nut are you going to give 'em?
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Is this one all right?
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"- Yes- Give it a different ""Nut""- Quit"
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"You got yourself a new Chocobo!Then, give Chocobo Male/Female a name."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stable'If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Your 'Chocobo Stable' are empty.
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Which Chocobo are you going to let go?
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"- Go ahead- No, don't"
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stable'If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa."
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Your 'Chocobo Stable' are empty.
Choco Billy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Which one are you going to take?
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- Giddyap!- Whoa!
Chole,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Welcome! Hey, I've got something good to tell you.The white Chocobo likes it when you scratch behind its ears.But if you scratch it someplace that it doesn't like, it'll get mad, so be careful."
Chole,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Hey, do you know what a Chocobo Sage is?What!? You've actually met him!?Wow! What did he tell you?"
Chole,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Wow, that's amazing! ...let me take some notes."
Chole,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Hey, did you ever see the Chocobo Sage again? What did he tell you?"
Chole,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Wow, that's amazing! ...let me take some notes.What...?"
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- Let me jot this down- Chole's Chocobo inspection- Nothing
Chole,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Other than regular Chocobo, there are ""Mountain Chocobo"" and ""River-Chocobo"".In order for the ""Mountain Chocobo"" and ""River Chocobo"" to be born,You feed the ""Carob Nut"" to a ""Great Chocobo"" or a ""Good Chocobo"" and have it produce an egg.But we don't sell any ""Carob Nuts"".A ""Great Chocobo"" and a ""Good Chocobo"" are found...On an island Southeast of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling at Corel. And in the area west of Corel.The ""Carob Nut"" can be found south of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling. Monsters carry them.Let's see, is Bone Village just south of there?One surprise If you get the ""Mountain Chocobo"" and the ""River Chocobo"" to produce an egg,You'll get a Chocobo that can cross mountains and rivers. I bet that the right nut for that is the ""Carob Nut.""Bigger surprise: There seems to be a Chocobo that can cross the ocean.If you could cross the ocean, mountains, and rivers, there'd be no place you couldn't go.In order to get an Ocean Chocobo you need to get a Mountain-and-river Chocobo to mate with something else.If you mate the Mountain-and-river Chocobo with a ""Wonderful Chocobo"",You'll get an Ocean Chocobo. But to do that you can't use an ordinary Nut.The ""Nut"" that produces Ocean Chocobos is the ""Zeio Nut"".This is the first I've heard of it. I wonder where you get them?Zeio Nuts are found on a little island east of the Chocobo Sage.""Goblins"" have them. With this, you can produce an ""Ocean Chocobo"".According to my research, Mountain, river, and ocean Chocobos are hard to produce.But, if you take the right care of the Chocobo, and increase their Class ranking by winning at the races, it'll increase your chances of getting one."
Chole,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"(if you have only one chocobo)Hey, there's only one Chocobo."
Chole,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"(otherwise)For telling me that story, I'll tell you about each Chocobo's abilities.From what I see, the fastest sprinter is...I think it's Choco.And, the fastest one is...That's ChocoAlso, from what I can tell, the one with the most stamina is...I think it's Choco.Finally, the most intelligent one is...That's Choco"
Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"I almost passed out when I saw Weapon.It seems Weapon was beaten, but a Shinra soldier told me there are 4 more."
Fisherman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Once Meteor hits, not just the fish, but the whole ocean will be destroyed..."
Older Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,What? Cloud is missing?
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Maybe... he dropped some from the North Caves into the Lifestream...Sir, do you know where the Lifestream runs through?Cloud might have drifted from there."
Older Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"What? The Northern... what? Sorry, but I don't think I follow.But... I think I remember hearing Priscilla saying 'Life... something' before."
Priscilla,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Who are you---?Lifestream?Yeah, I know! It's Mr. Dolphin's playground.There's a Three-taloned island south of the continent. I heard the Lifestream runs below that island.But why are you asking about the Lifestream?"
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Cloud fell into the Lifestream at the North Cave, and has been missing ever since."
Priscilla,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Huh, Cloud!?Hurry up and help him!! He's very important to me."
Soldier,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"It's kinda lonely at the airport without the Highwind, isn't it?I miss that bikini girl on the side of the plane."
Soldiers at the Airport,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"I sure was frightened when Weapon attacked. It gives me the chills knowing there's still two of them left.Oh yeah? Well, I'm ready to fight the worst enemy mankind's ever had like a real warrior. It's not everyday you get to fight in an inter-planetary war."
Materia Shopkeeper,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Come on in!Welcome!!I just can't believe it. I never thought a monster like Weapon really existed.

Soldier Studying,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"I lost most of my rivals in the attack on Weapon.Oh, of course, I was here, studying.And the coveted green officer's uniform is almost in my reach.After that, I'll get on the newspapers as a plain clothed First Class officer in SOLDIER...A triumphant return to my homeland!! Tons of fan letters... My future's peachy!"
Barkeeper,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"I'm sorry. I've decided to close this place down.All my regular customers were killed by Weapon.Everyone was pretty weird, but I got a lot of memories of them."

Redhead,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,I won't charge you for a smile...
Girl,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Please go to the counter.
Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Why don't you surround yourself with young girls and have some fun... maybe for the last time.
Shopkeeper,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"I hired more girls after hearing that the world's coming to an end, but I wonder if I made a mistake.I keep getting more and more in debt. I've got to get out from under it somehow. Maybe I'll have Weapon help me."
Girls,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Thank you very much!
Shopkeeper,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"I used to be in SOLDIER. Recently, I've felt like dressing up like this...I don't know why, it's out of season, but..."

Delinquent Soldier,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,All the real soldiers were killed fighting Weapon.It may seem ironic that losers like me are still alive. But that's the reality of it.
Shinra Manager,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"I only came to help with the transporting of Junon's Huge Cannon, Sister Ray, but...Now the company tells me not to bother coming back...What's being a Shinra employee all about...?Yeeeeee......If Weapon killed all the upper management... then I'll be President...!!"

Materia Shopkeeper,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Oh man... Everything is over, once the meteor hits...I've been selling Materia for 10 years now, ever since I was 16. What have I been doing with my life...?Welcome! Oh, it's nothing. Now, please make yourselves comfortable!"

Kid,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Don't worry, mom! All of us just need to go through that door!Mr. Bugenhagen sealed it so we wouldn't have to worry about it!But what's a seal...?"
Bugenhagen,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Ho Ho Hoooo....no time to be humming now. The planet is nearing imminent death.Where is Cloud? Wasn't he with you?
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,That's why we're here... Cloud... Cloud has...
Bugenhagen,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"I see... Cloud has......It's true that there are several places on the planet where Lifestream is gathered.But most of those places are below the surface where humans cannot reach them.There's only one place. An island floating in the Southern Sea...What did you say? I haven't left here in years... No good. I can't remember.In the Southern Seas I think there was an island where Lifestream is.But even if you find Cloud there...Life's dream is a mass of spiritual energy,and one person alone probably couldn't stand against such an incredible spiritual current..."
Woman in Shop,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"How can you shop at a time like this?What? 'Me, in business'?Don't worry, it's all right. I get paid by the company.My real job is to protect the secret of Nibelheim.What? Secret?We don't have a clue. But it's all right.It's all over anyway!The end, the end, the end!! Yeah, even as we speak, Meteor...! The End...!"
Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,What's going to happen to this planet!? What the hell's Shinra doing!?

Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Meteor's coming toward us!? And I can't even go to the bathroom...!?
Redhead,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"If things go on like this, then Meteor's just going to smash right into us and kill us all, right? ......I guess that's life?"
Mechanic,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Look up at the sky. The bigger Meteor gets, the less time we have to live."
Old Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Shinra's trying to gather the Huge Materia from Corel and Fort Condor. There are four left, and they're transporting them here.I can't stand the thought of them using my rocket for something like this.Anyways.How 'bout it? Want to look at the rocket with me?"
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- Look up- No
Old Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"It seems like there's a lot happenin' in the outside world, but as long as I got this rocket... I'm satisfied."
Old Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Oh, how boring..."
Shera,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,...What's going to happen?
Woman Walking Near River,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Life is like the dew on the leaves of the trees. Whether that planet falls or not is no more than a fleeting glimmer.
Old Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Oh, you know lately things have been like that. You can even see the moon in the afternoon. Everyone's celebrating."
Boy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"No, Gramps! That's a big red planet in the sky! Everyone's scared of it!!"
Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"This is a weapons store of the hard cores, by the hard cores, and for the hard cores! Come on and take a look, why doncha!?"
Shopkeeper,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Hey yo! Welcome!You aren't tired of my babbling?Great! Then come on in and start buying!
Barkeeper,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"First the ground started shaking, then that large star......Yy, you think... It's all over?"
Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Hey. Things look pretty sad around here.With things the way they are in the world I guess there's nothing I can do about it.Running around like a fool won't help matters any. So, we all might as well sit back and have a beer..."
Little Kid,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"When that big star bashes into us, both Wutai and Da-chao are going to be dust! Can't we do something?"
Shopkeeper,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,You're still gonna sit here and buy stuff at a time like this?You're an odd one...
Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"And now it's too late to be worrying about materia at this stage of the game...If you see anything you need, buy it."
Man on the Path to Godo's House,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,The end is right in front of us...But what can you do about it? Just go on living your life day in and day out...
Man Outside Godo's House,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Have you ever heard the story of the scales of the Water God?They're not just regular scales. They have special hidden powers. And are impervious to the strongest flames.But of course I don't think they'd stand up to the fire that huge eerie-lookin' Planet's gonna make when it crashes into us...
People Praying,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"num, num...... I hope the planet doesn't fall anywhere around here......He's in the pagoda next to Lord Godo. Lord Godo says we're stuck...Help me. Help me. Help me......"

Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- Are you going to run away??- What are you doing?
Excavator,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"We've already learned about everything that has happened from the beginning of this Planet through fossils.Now, we want to see on through to the end of the Planet... It's such a mixed feeling..."
Excavator,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,We're excavating. It's like the land's telling a history of the planet.
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Eyaaaa!...Consciousness of the Ancients?...I'm sorry. ...I can't... understand.Eaayy!? Again?It speaks directly to my mind... Is this the Consciousness of the Ancients?...I'm sorry. ...I can't... understand.
Cid,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Whoa...!...Consciousness of the Ancients?
Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,I don't think I could live in this town. It gets so cold here!I have to move again... I don't know where to start.
Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,The reason for the drop in temperature must be because of that dome of light at the Northern limits...You all should get away from here and go to a place like Mideel Island in the south.
Boy,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,I wanted to get a lot better at snowboarding...
Old Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Cough... cough... I've been living in this town for 60 years. And STILL I caught a cold...I heard there's a doctor on a Southern island somewhere. I sure wish he'd come here... cough... cough...
Woman,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Grandma's been sick for a while and doesn't have much energy lately...
Man in Yard,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"It's the first time that the temperature has dipped this low, this fast...There's also that mysterious light at the Northern limits too. Does it mean that we've reached the end of the world?"
Man,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"With all the strange things happening in the world, I kinda understand why people want to leave..."
Man 2,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Maybe we'd better leave town soon too.Let's go to that island in the South! What was it called...... hmm?Yeah, yeah, I heard that there's a town called Mideel on a southern island."
Person in Bathroom,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,I'm still in here! All right!?
Little Girls,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,I heard that there's a barrier on top of the mountain.What's a barrier? You mean that light on the top of the mountain?
Man in Thicket,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,There's a barrier at the North end of the crater! You shouldn't go any further.
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Ho ho. It's unusual for people to come to such an out of the way place...I can't remember how many years it's been since the last person came.
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Who are you?
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Me? I'm......I don't know.

Cid,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,(the hell's up with this guy?)
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Now what can I do for you?
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- What about that Chocobo?
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"That chocobo? Well that one is...Let's see now, I don't quite remember..."
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Now what can I do for you?
"Cloud, Tifa, or Cid",The World - After Meteor is Summoned,- You remember something?
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"I remember now! That's the one they call...It's a Mountain Chocobo. And just like the name says, he can cross any mountain.There was another one that could cross rivers, too. They call him 'River Chocobo'."
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Where can we catch one?
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Where can we find one?
Cid,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Where can I get one of those Whatdyacallem chocobos?
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,There aren't any around now.
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,...... That's one right there isn't it?
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,What about that one right there?
Cid,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,What're you flappin' about? There's one right there!
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Wha? I wonder what he's doing there?Can't remember for the life of me...
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Oh, oh yeah! That chocobo was.........was bred from a 'Great Chocobo' and a 'Good Chocobo'.When they're given ""Carob Nuts"" while breeding, there's a chance you'll get one of these Chocobos."
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,So where's this chocobo?So where can I get some of these 'Carob Nuts'?
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,So where can I find those Chocobos?...and what about those 'Carob Nuts'...
Cid,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,So where is the chocobo?And what about those nut things?
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Huh? Where? Where was that?And what was that nut?Can't remember for the life of me...
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Oh, OK. I remember! That chocobo......It's on an island southeast of here, In a place called Corel surrounded by greenery.You should be able to catch one just west of Corel. And some 'Carob Nuts', too......There used to be some monsters just south of here that had them. Or you might............... Funny...... What was I saying just now?Can't remember for the life of me..."
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Oh right!It was about the Mountain Chocobo and the River Chocobo I told you about.When you mate these two together......you get one that can cross rivers AND mountains.And... And also... uh, what was I saying?Can't remember for the life of me..."
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Oh, yeah! And also...There's one that can cross oceans, too!"
Cloud,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,You probably don't remember but...How can I get one of those Chocobos?
Tifa,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"You probably are going to say you forgot, but...How can I get one of those chocobos?"
Cid,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Great! I know you probably already forgot but,Where can I get one of those chocobos?"
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Hey, don't tease me like that! To get an Ocean-crossing Chocobo, you just...Let's see now... ...Nope. Don't remember a thing.Can't remember for the life of me..."

Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Oh, right! You'll need a...'Zeio Nut'. Now let me see, as I remember, the Zeio nut...Where was it you could find those things?Can't remember for the life of me..."
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,Oh yeah! Zeio nuts were...The favorite of goblins. There's a small island east of here where the goblins have a bunch of them.
Chocobo Sage,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,I think......that's all I'm gonna remember.Oh!That's it...
Cid,The World - After Meteor is Summoned,"Wh, what the hell was that!? That came buzzin' past here like a powerhouse!"
Old Man at Entrance,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Ahoy! Hey ain't you a beaut. This here's Mideel. It's a quiet little Hot Springs town.Just the perfect place for old folks like us to live out our lives.I hear that things ain't so peaceful on the outside. But here it's still nice and quiet.
Shopper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"But anyhow, that overgrown moon is going to fall down on us isn't it?This's no joke! We've got to start stocking up on supplies before they're all gone!Outta the way! Hey, move it, move it!"
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"What is it? You're being awful friendly all of a sudden.Oh, so that's it. You want the Samolen Greens... don't you?- Give it some Samolen Greens- Don't give it any"
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Well, okay. Here, go ahead and eat."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,hee hee... how cute! I just want to tickle him.- Tickle his feet- Tickle his stomach- Tickle his neck- Tickle his belly button- Tickle behind his ears- Tickle under his arms
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Oh, you scared me...! I thought you were dead!"
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Sorry, little guy. I can't give you any."
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Welcome! We always welcome cash! Now, about where you want to go...I'm afraid other customers have already booked it up. There's nothing left.......just kidding! Just a little joke. Now what can I do for you?Thank you! Come again!"
Girl in Blue Outside,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Gather 'round, gather 'round, this is a bargain!!We've got the best armor and weapons, the likes of which you won't find anywhere else.But it's first come first served, so get yours now!Step right up! You there, don't just stand around outside.Go on in! Come on! Don't be shy, step right up!I'll never know why he wanted to open a store in a dead town like this. What's up with him......? ...sigh......"
Man,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Everything must come to an end. And someday it's gonna be your turn. Even the world's gotta end sometime.Everybody leaves at one time or another. And everyone gets left also. That's just fate...It's sad, but there's nothing that can be done about it. So that's why I'm prayin' like this for all of you."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Huh......? What could that be?There's something stuck deep inside that looks like a key... It's hard to get out.Well, I'll just let it go for now......"
Shopper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"You again! You aren't here hoarding up goods too are you?Don't reach in front of me! Everything in this store is mine!I've got money to burn! I've been saving it like mad just for a time like this!C'mon, outta the way! Move, will you? Move!"
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Welcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage! What can I get you today?Thank you very much! Please come again."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,No good... I wonder if it's locked?
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,I wonder if there isn't some way to get this outta here...?If I just move this...... And push that...... Okay! I got it out!
Woman,Mideel - Finding Cloud,You say you don't know when the stars are gonna fall outta the sky? Is that for real?I still don't believe it! How could this be happen?
Old Man,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Ancient Weapon? End of the world? I don't know nothing about that! I'm gonna live to be a hundred!There's tons of stuff I still gotta do! This's just the beginning.And what have Shinra and SOLDIER done about it? Tell me! They're a waste!!
Girl,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Actually, I'm a beautiful maid. I just work here in the accessory store part-time.Everything here can compare with the best goods anywhere. So, how about one?Thank you. Stop by again."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Oh yeah, shall I try that old beat up key?- Use the beat up old key!- Forget it"
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Is something wrong......?
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Ulp!?Huh? Uh, no......What am I gonna do......?- Lie your butt off!- Tell them the truth!"
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Oh... why, thank you very much."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Whew... that was close. But that was kind of bad...
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Huh? Key? You mean the one to that door?
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Hah, hah, hah! That's a good one!"
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"???
ShopkeeperOf course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.
What!? It's not a real door?
ShopkeeperThat's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this.
Really? Thank you.
 and the others received ""Cursed Ring""!
ShopkeeperIf possible, we're hoping to pass through a dream door like that one into another worldI got the feeling that you all might be able to make my dreams come true in my place. Weird, isn't it?"
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Of course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,What!? It's not a real door?
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"That's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Really? Thank you.
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"If possible, we're hoping to pass through a dream door like that one into another worldI got the feeling that you all might be able to make my dreams come true in my place. Weird, isn't it?"
Woman,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Huh? Never seen you here before. You from outta town? How're things on the outside?Between the earthquakes and Meteor...... It just might be the end of the world like everyone's been sayin'...Oh, how depressing! What a miserable world this is......"
Shopper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Ohh...... there's not much time left!! You never know when that moon is gonna come crashing down!!When it all comes down to it, this world's about money and material things!If you got 'em, you can get by whenever, wherever!Gotta buy!! Gotta buy, buy, buy!! I'm gonna shop till I drop!!"
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Ah, welcome to you! What I get you to-day?Thank very much! You come 'gain."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,What's the matter? Are you all alone?
Bald Man,Mideel - Finding Cloud,......guess it's been about a week now since he washed up here on the shore... Poor pokey-headed young thing...
Old Man,Mideel - Finding Cloud,It was really sad...... but weird. He was holding this really long sword.I dunno. The whole thing feels unlucky to me. But the amazing thing was those weird blue eyes......
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Wha!?
Bald Man,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Yeah... a villager found him a little ways down the coast... It was about a week ago I think.
Old Man,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Yeah, poor kid...... He must've drifted from somewhere pretty far away..."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Cloud!! It must be!! It's Cloud!!
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,You sure!?
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Over here!
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,BINGO!!
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Jackpot!
Vincent,Mideel - Finding Cloud,You've found him.
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Heh, good job, Tifa."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,So where is he? Is he safe!? Where is he now......?
Bald Man,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Yeah... up ahead here... At the, uh, clinic......"
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,He's alive...!Cloud...... Cloud's alive!!
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Uh......!? Yo, Tifa!!"
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Halt!
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Oh, HEY!"
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Wait up!
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Cloud!?
Doctor,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Here now. The way you're running around here, you'd think Meteor fell or something."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"I'm sorry, but I heard that a friend of mine was being taken care of here......"
Doctor,Mideel - Finding Cloud,A friend...?Oh yeah......! That young fellow!?Don't worry. Your friend is next door. But I'm afraid his condition is...
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Here?Over here.
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Oh... Cloud!! I'm so glad you're safe!?......!?Cloud......?
Cloud,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Uh...... aaa......?
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Wh...... what's wrong...... Cloud......?
Cloud,Mideel - Finding Cloud,A...... Gurk......?
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Cloud! What happened to you......!?
Doctor,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Mako poisoning...... Quite an advanced case......It appears this young man's been exposed to a high level of Mako energy for a protracted period of time.He probably has no idea who or where he is now......Poor fellow, his voice doesn't even work. He is literally miles away from us.Some place far away where no one's ever been... All alone......"
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Doctor......!!
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,That's bad......
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,How horrible......
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,You lyin' or what!?
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,That's terrible......
Vincent,Mideel - Finding Cloud,.........
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Damn...... that's evil.
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Cloud......
Doctor,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Ahem! Let us excuse ourselves.Listen, would you all mind...... waiting outside?"
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,......
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Why......? What do you want me to do?Please, Cloud...... Talk to me......Tell me you see me, that you can hear me...... Tell me, please......I came this far believing in the memories we have together...This isn't happening......! This is too cruel......Oh, Cloud......! I............"
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,So what about him? You know...... Cloud?
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Tell me doctor, is Cloud all right? I mean will he heal?"
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Hey doc, is he okay? Is he gonna heal?"
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Hey doctor, is Cloud all right? Is he gonna get better? Come on, tell us the truth."
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Listen Doc, why don't you tell us the truth.What about Cloud? Is he all right?"
Doctor,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"I'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning. I've never seen a case this bad...An immense amount of Mako-drenched knowledge was put into his brain all at once......No normal human could have survived it...... It's a miracle he did!"
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,No wonder...... After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed up here......
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,No wonder. He fell into the Lifestream and was washed up here......
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,No lie. After fallin' head first into the Lifestream.
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,No wonder. After falling into the Lifestream......
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,No wonder...... After all he fell into the Lifestream and was carried down here.
Doctor,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"But remember, the light of hope can be found anywhere.Listen, if you give up hope... What will happen to him?"
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Hmm, I know he'll recover! Cloud was a strong member of SOLDIER."
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Yeah, that's right. Besides, WE'RE here for him. He's gotta get better!"
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Yeah! I know Cloud'll get better!With friends like us worrying about him He can't go wrong.
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,......... Hope............I guess that's all that's left for us now......
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"......hope......Hey, but honestly, man...... Do I really want him to come back?What did he do for the world? What can he do for us from here on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow......"
Doctor,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Is something wrong?
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"No, nothin'. Nothin' at all, doc."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,.........
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,You okay?
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Are you all right, Tifa?"
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"You okay, Tifa?"

Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,You okay?
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Yes...... I'm sorry I had you all worried.And I have something I want to tell you all......
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"I don't care about anything else, only Cloud......I...... want to be by his side......"
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Yeah, that's probably best......For Cloud...... an' for you......"
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Yes, that's best!"
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,You gotta do it then. You gotta live true to yourself.
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"If Tifa was my nurse, I'd switch places with Cloud any day!"
Vincent,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Do what you wish.
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Yeah. Right. Hang in there, Tifa."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"I'm sorry, everyone... At a time like this......"
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Why you apologizin'? We'll come back again an' check on ya.
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,That's all right. We'll be by again.
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"No big, no big. I'll pop in again later."
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,What're you talkin' about? Not even. We'll stop in again.
Vincent,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Don't worry. We'll return and check on him later.
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Don't worry. I'll stop by again sometime.
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"You take care now, Tifa. And take care of Cloud."
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Do your best, Tifa. Take care of Cloud."
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Look after Cloud. Take care, Tifa."
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Hope Cloud gets better soon.
Vincent,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Take care of him.
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"You hang in there, Tifa. Take care of Cloud."
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Right......
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Oh, and uh, Tifa... I don't like askin' this but......Is he really your childhood friend? And not Sephiroth's shadow?"
Tifa,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Huh!? Well... that is......No, I'm sure of it!"
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Yeah......? Okay then...... Sorry for askin' that.
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,We gotta get back to the Highwind.
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,We should be getting back to the Highwind.
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Hey, shouldn't we be gettin' back to the Highwind?"
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Well, I guess we'd better go back to the Highwind."
Vincent,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Very well then, we should be getting back to the Highwind."
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Now, we gotta be headin' back to the Highwind."
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,What're we gonna do now! What can WE do?Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do?An' don' go tellin' us to wait for Cloud to get better.
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Oh, I've got some news."
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Yeah, what!? That you a spy?"
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Yeah...... I've already told you I was.Both gya ha ha and Kya ha ha, are up to something.Wanna eavesdrop?"
Rufus,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Now then...... We're faced with two issues.1 Destroy Meteor. 2 Remove the barrier around North Cave and defeat Sephiroth.Any ideas?
Heidegger,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Gya haah hah hah! We already solved the first problem!Meteor will soon be smashed to bits!The plan has already been put in motion. Namely, to collect Huge Materia from each region."
Rufus,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Well......
Scarlet,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Huge Materia is a high density special type of materia made through a special compression process in Mako reactors.The energy extracted from it is 330 times the strength of normal materia.Ha, ha, ha! How about that!?We will gather all the Huge Materia together and ram it into Meteor.That will cause a huge explosion!! Reducing Meteor literally to bits."
Rufus,Mideel - Finding Cloud,You're going to ram Meteor?Do you think we have the technology to do it?
Scarlet,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Don't worry about that!More importantly, we've got to collect Huge Materia from each area."
Heidegger,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"We've already collected materia from Nibelheim.All that's left is ""Corel"" and ""Fort Condor"".I've already dispatched troops to Corel.Ghaa haah hah hah!"
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Corel!What else can they do to Corel!?
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"And the Huge Materia......You mean the Huge Materia, don't you? I've heard about it.When, our small materia nears the larger one, something should happen.I'm certain of it.That's why we're using the power of materia in our fight......"
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!Besides, when Cloud gets back, I wanna show him this Huge Materia. He's gonna be shocked."
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"So, what are you saying, Barret?Even though you're always knocking him, you really want Cloud to return."
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. You just... shut your face!Every group's gotta have a leader.An' that's me!Or at least I wanna be... But I ain't cut out to be no leader.I never knew that till lately.An' that's what is......
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,......ZZZZ...... hmph?
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,You been chosen to be the new leader.
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Pain in the ass. Forget it.
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you.We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You!That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can."
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Hm...... this ship's gonna save the Planet, huh? Ain't that gonna be just a little tough?Oh man, that went straight to my heart.I'm a man, too!Okay, I'll do it! Everyone, follow me!"
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Awright, now here's the first job.The Operation Room's waiting for you!"
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Yeah!!
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Yo, Cid!When you're ready, we're headin' for the Corel Reactor. C'mon Mr. leader, you'd better hurry."
Yuffie,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Cid......????I know you're all dyin' to talk to a babe like me!But just leave me alone. This ship makes me...... urk...!!
Bridge Crew Member 1,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Good day, Captain!"
Bridge Crew Member 2,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Looks like you turned out to be the leader after all, Captain......"
Pilot in training (LV5),Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Eaggggghh! Congrats' on becoming our leader, Cap'n!"
Crew Member outside Operation Room,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!"
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,- Fly Airship- Chew the fat
Crew Member outside Operation Room,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Huh? Did I forget Cid? You're testing me on whether I forgot or not!
Crew Member outside Operation Room,Mideel - Finding Cloud,I'm not just shooting the breeze! I'm also working!
Barret,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Yo, Mr. Leader! Get your pilot ass up here!"
Nanaki,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Cid.Let's visit Cloud and Tifa from time to time.
Cait Sith,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Hmmn, the Huge Materia is at Corel, Fort Condor......I'm sure there was another place that had it. Where was that......?"
Vincent,Mideel - Finding Cloud,Cid...... I wish I had your go-get-them attitude.It appears my feelings vanished into thin air ever since I was in that long slumber......
Pilot in training (LV6),Mideel - Finding Cloud,Yaah! Shall we take off?
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,- Yes- No
Pilot in training (LV6),Mideel - Finding Cloud,Yaah! We're taking off!
Cid,Mideel - Finding Cloud,"Well, let's see...... What's a good place to head to?Corel? Fort Condor?"
Redhead,North Corel - Huge Materia,"Hey, listen to me! The Shinra troops are on the move.The TV news said Rufus came up with 2 plans. One, is to launch a rocket into space containing Huge Materia......Is Huge Materia really that destructive?"
Priscilla,North Corel - Huge Materia,Who are you---?
Cid,North Corel - Huge Materia,We found Cloud!
Priscilla,North Corel - Huge Materia,I'm so happy!! Someday I'm going to be Cloud's wife.I've decided I'm gonna be Cloud's wife.
Soldier on the Path to the Airport,North Corel - Huge Materia,"Right now the Shinra's using it to gather the Huge Materia from the Corel Reactor and from the Fort Condor Reactor.The Gelnika's flying all over the place! The only one that's not busy, is probably me!"
1st Soldier at the Airport,North Corel - Huge Materia,The President is gathering up all the Huge Materia on the planet. He wants to shoot it at Meteor in the rocket.President Rufus is different from the older generation. He'll protect the planet with all of the technology Shinra currently has.
2nd Soldier at the Airport,North Corel - Huge Materia,"Protect? No, I don't think so. The President isn't the type to do anything so heroic. It's all just a game--a question of winning or losing--to him..."
Commander,North Corel - Huge Materia,"Our forces are in the process of gathering the Huge Materia from the Corel and the Fort Condor Reactors!Once these two missions are completed, the Underwater Reactor will be our next target!Till then, we do nothing but train, train, train!
At Gongaga...
Old ManThis reactor's useless, but I hear there's still big materia at the Corel, Fort Condor, and the Junon reactors.Shinra's working to get the materia from all those places...... But for what...?
RedheadSeems like the Shinra is planning something big to destroy Meteor...I heard they're going to do something with all that big materia they've been gathering...After what happened with the reactor you can't trust Shinra.
At Cosmo Canyon...
BugenhagenYou are using Shinra materia, as a weapon?Materia is highly dense spiritual energy. A shred of the planet's life. It should not be used as a weapon.We must stop using it... or the planet will become weakened.

At Corel...
ManShinra soldiers came around sayin' they were gathering up all the Huge Materia.I think they're gonna bring it here by coal train, from the Corel Reactor.
Big ManSome Shinra soldiers went up to Mt. Corel. They said they're collecting Huge Materia to blow up Meteor!Ya think they can really do it...? I'll bet the reactor destroys everything even before Meteor hits!
Cid and the others travel through the mountains to the Corel Reactor.
SoldierYou guys are...!
They fight and defeat the two soldiers guarding the door.
CidGuess we're safe for now...!
A train whistle sounds.

BarretDa---mn!
NanakiOhh!
YuffieWa... wait!
Cait SithWha... what is it, what is it!
Vincent!!

They get out of the way as a train exits the reactor.
CidLooks like they're takin' off with the Huge Materia in that train!

BarretNO! You damn boneheads!
NanakiDid the Shinra beat us!?
YuffieWhat are ya gonna do!? Huge Materia!?
Cait SithWha... you're not thinking about giving up...
Vincent...go after them?

CidHey, do you know who I am?I'm Cid - that's who the hell I am! Now just let me handle it!
They run inside the reactor and another whistle sounds.
CidHey, hey, hey, hey---!
They come out riding a shorter train.

BarretHow can they even drive this?
NanakiIt sure helped having Cid here. I had no idea he could drive a train...
YuffiePretty good for an old guy. I'm impressed you can move this thing!
Cait SithWay to go, Mister! You used to drivin' this thing too?
VincentI'm impressed. You can drive this too...?

CidDon't ask me... I don't know!

BarretWhat!?
NanakiWa...What!?
YuffieWhat!? You serious!?
Cait SithHuh? What'd you just say!?
VincentWha... what...!?

CidDon't worry! I can handle this kinda stuff!Two levers; one on the right and one on the left...I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right!?Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 minutes.We're gonna fly!! Hold on tight!!

If they fail to catch up to Shinra's train...
CidDAMN!Sorry! I couldn't catch up to them!
They walk into North Corel, which is unharmed.
CidSorry... I never shoulda gave that Huge Materia to the Shinra so easily...

BarretCan't keep regrettin' the past... It's the future we gotta think about now.
NanakiWhat are we going to do now?
YuffieNo use baggin' on yourself! It's not like you, OLD guy!
Cait SithIt's not all over yet. Cheer up!
Vincent...Isn't it too early to give up?



If they catch up to Shinra's train in time...
CidAll right! We're gonna jump!!
They jump to the other train and fight their way to the front.
Soldier DrivingWhat the! You... you guys!
CidAll right--- Just hand over the Huge Materia!
Soldier DrivingSh......Whooooa----!
They fight off the soldier.
CidYou got guts comin' after me!I'll never forget you!

BarretGot no time for that now!
NanakiWe got it going, but what about the brakes?
YuffieForget about the Huge Materia, WE'RE the ones in deep trouble!
Cait SithWhat are we gonna do, kill off the engineer!?
VincentHit the brakes, Chief.

CidI KNOW, already! Just shut up and keep quiet! If we keep this up, we'll crash right into North Corel!Let's see... If we alternately use the levers to accelerate, ...It should brake if we move the levers up or down simultaneously!

BarretHey, it's not working!
NanakiWe're gaining speed!
YuffieWhat are you doin' accelerating!?
Cait SithHey---------WAIT! ...other way, other way, other way!
VincentIsn't it... the other way?

Cid@#*#! The other way!? Just watch, this time, I'll...

BarretHey... HEY HEY!!
NanakiWHOOOOOO----A!!
YuffieGet serious, you old man!
Cait SithNo... DON'T----!!
Vincent	......!!


If Cid slows the train down in time...
CidSHI---------!!
The train stops just at the entrance to North Corel.
Received Key Item ""Huge Materia""!
Older WomanYou sure are brave. I'm impressed!
ManYou guys are really something!
Big ManAren't you the ones that stopped the Shinra Train?The Shinra was just about to destroy our lives again...
ManTo you it may be a junk yard, but to us its home.
If Barret is in the party, he will instead say:
It might be full of junk, but this is the only home we got, Barret!!
BarretOf... of course! We're all born and raised in the coal mines!!No matter how tough it gets, our hearts burn bright red like coal!
ManTo hell with Meteor! We're Coal Miners, ain't we?We'll dig a deep tunnel and hide from the Meteor!
Big ManThat's it!Hey, kid! How about givin' somethin' to these guys fightin' the Shinra?
A kid comes down from above.
KidI got it out of the well. Isn't it an amazing rock!!
Received ""Ultima"" Materia!
ManMust've been a horrific battle. You have scars all over your body.I already talked to the Inn's owner, today you can rest for free.
Cid and the others spend the night.
The next day, inside the crumbling house...
ManI don't want to die, but who can stop Meteor?
WomanIs Meteor really going to crash down on us......?I'm still young...... I'll never marry again.This memento is all I have left of my husband... I'll give it to you if you'll please stop Meteor...
Received ""Catastrophe""!
Little GirlHey, what's a Meteor?
Back outside...
ManWhenever I look up in the sky, I see Meteor staring me right in the face......If you're comin' down, then hurry up do it!! 'Cause I'm gonna kick the $#@& outta ya!
Big ManI figure if I stay alive long enough, something good's bound to happen.
Inside a tent...
Old ManWhat the? Don't get hit by the train!
Black WomanWith Meteor coming, I guess it won't make any difference...
In another tent...
WomanYou saved my life. Not that I have much longer to live anyway...
KidWhen I grow up, I'm gonna travel the world collecting glowing stones!


If Cid fails to slow the train down in time...
CidOh ^%$#&$! We're gonna crash into North Corel!
The train crashes into North Corel. Cid comes to in the inn, rolling off the bed.
InnkeeperYou all right?Some townspeople carried you here so the Shinra wouldn't find you.How much more will they have to destroy before they're satisfied!?Isn't anyone brave enough to stick it to Shinra?
Cid and the others step outside to see the damage.
Cid^$#@%$! We couldn't stop the train...

BarretI did it again... I can't keep up with this.
NanakiI could never forgive Shinra!
YuffieI'd be sad if this place was my hometown...
Cait SithWe got into this situation because we goofed...
VincentA spectacular sight...

Man in HardhatHey, what's this world coming to...?Even the Gold Saucer is closing. So does that mean there's no time to be playing around?
Inside the crumbling house...
ManThe town is in shambles...... and Meteor is falling our way...
Older WomanAll we have left is our love for each other.
WomanIs Meteor really going to crash down on us......?I'm still young...... I'll never marry again.This memento is all I have left of my husband... I'll give it to you if you'll please stop Meteor...
Received ""Catastrophe""!
Little GirlHey, what's a Meteor?
Weapons ShopkeeperMy store was all right!
Big ManWe've lost everything... Now we have to start again from '1'... no, from '0'.
ManGod, what have we done...?Well, no use just sitting around talking about it. What can we do to get things back to normal?
Man 2While you guys were relaxing, Shinra troops took the Huge Materia.
Old ManUm... where was the next train station?
Black WomanSeeing that train got Grandpa more excited than I've seen him for some time.
KidI got a glowing rock from the well.I'll sell it to you for 50000 gil!
Cid- Buy it- Don't buy it

Buy it
Received ""Ultima"" Materia!
KidYay! My house is finished!!
Or, if you don't have enough money:
You don't have enough money! Don't try to take advantage of me just because I'm a kid!!


Don't buy it
KidI wish someone would buy this rock off of me...



If you went to Fort Condor before going to Corel, the party stops to talk before leaving.
CidThere's only one more Huge Materia the Shinra needs... That's the one at the Underwater Reactor.

BarretWe'll get there first!
NanakiWe HAVE to stop them!!
YuffieWe've got to hurry and stop 'em!!
Cait SithWe headin' out to the Underwater Reactor?
VincentAre we going to the Underwater Reactor?

CidWith us always in their face, even the Shinra's gotta be getting tired of it all.We have to hurry that much... ...right now I'm more worried about him than anything else!

BarretCloud...
NanakiYou must be talking about Cloud...
YuffieYou must mean Cloud...
Cait SithCloud...
VincentCloud...

CidYeah, and I'm worried about Tifa, too.Let's go see what's going on at Mideel...
Back on the Highwind...
CidWhat's next? Shall we head for Fort Condor?
BarretHuh? Mr. Leader, what's next!?
NanakiWe'll do our best for Cloud and you.......And Aeris, too.
Vincent......Don't expect anything else from me except fighting beside you.I don't have any comforting words.Of course, I don't believe you're the type of guy who needs kindness from other's......

Vincent,North Corel - Huge Materia,"......Don't expect anything else from me except fighting beside you.I don't have any comforting words.Of course, I don't believe you're the type of guy who needs kindness from other's......"
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"We've been fighting the Shinra for a long time at this battlefield.Even now, we're still settled in for a long war with them.If you aren't in a hurry, would you help us fight them?Listen, we don't want to push you but, if you're in the middle of something, why don't you finish that first?"
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,- Like to help but...- I guess we'll help you
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,All right then...... Take care of yourselves...
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Really!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details.
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Do you guys want to see it, too?"
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,What is it?
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"The condors. They're huge. Come on, have a look."
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"What do ya think? Awesome, huh?"
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Hmmn, now this is something, I never thought anyone would ever climb up here.Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra. You'd better get down before you get involved."
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"A battlefield, we can't overlook that."
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Shinra again.
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,The Shinra? Here too?
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,......
Vincent,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,What do you mean by that?
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"It appears you have a problem with Shinra, too. After all, you climbed up here.Why not listen to what I have to say for a moment?"
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"All right, talk on!"
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Do you know what's at the top of this mountain?
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Huh? Something's up there?
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Look close, old man."
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Yeah, come to think of it there was something."
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"No matter how you look at it, that's a reactor. And on top of it, is that the Condor?"
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a condor.Looks like there's a special materia up in the Mako reactor.Then came the condor, so Shinra dispatched the troops to get rid of it.Their plan is to get rid of the condor and the people on this mountain and to get the materia from the Mako Reactor.Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra ourselves.That's why we have hired soldiers to help us.As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by fighting along side of us...What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?"
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"If you go that far, what can I say. Well, we'll be able to do something if you leave it up to us."
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Hey! We'll come to the rescue.
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand, too."
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Okay, it's settled. We're gonna get the materia, right?"
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Well then, let's do our best."
Vincent,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,That's the right decision.
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,I'm begging you. Please prevent the reactor from being destroyed and the condors from being killed.
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"So shall I let you in on our strategy?The enemy is targeting this mountain's reactor and will be climbing to reach it.We must set a trap and hire soldiers to protect this place.Well, this is all we have...... this village doesn't have any money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke.To hire one soldier, we need 400 gil. So, if we hire 20 soldiers, we must have 8000 gil.That is, we would like you to use your own money to hire these soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and give the commands.We know that we're asking is selfish. We sent our wives and kids to another village. We are resigned to our fate.Let's get back to square one. If the enemy penetrates this shed, you'll have to fight them off immediately.I know it's a one shot deal, but I'm asking for your help.Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?"
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,- Enough
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Ready?
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"- Wait- Okay, ready- Hear more"
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,You've come at a good time. Shinra's changing its strategy now.It seems that Shinra will destroy the reactor and then take out the materia that's inside.
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Man, we're walking on dangerous ground. We can't lose now!"
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,We can't afford to be beaten!
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"If we lose here, all the materia we gathered will be for nothing."
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"You're right. If we lose here, we'll be in great danger."
Vincent,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,We must protect this area.
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Damn! I guess we have to protect this area, too."
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"The situation has changed. Looks like the enemy is set to attack. If we lose here, it's over.Our lives are in your hands. We're counting on you.Ready?"
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"- Wait- Okay, ready- Hear more"
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,This is the deciding battle. The enemy numbers more than ever before.
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,YES! We did it! That was wonderful! Thank you!! I doubt Shinra will attack now.
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Th, that light just now......The condor......The eggs......What!?Would you go outside and see what it was?"
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Gone...Be sure and report to my father, too.Oh, it's you. Thanks a lot."
Man with Hat,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Everyone, thanks. I really mean it. Thanks.Although there isn't anything we can give you, we'll make sure you can stop in and stay any time, so be sure to drop by.Yes, yes, and there's one thing I forgot to tell you......
Received key item ""Huge Materia""!
CidHuh? What's this?

BarretDamn man, it's Huge Materia.
YuffieGotta have that materia!
Cait SithHmm, you mean this?
VincentThis is......

The truth is, this is the materia inside the reactor.
CidWhat the hell did we fight for?
We weren't protectin' the reactor, we were protectin' the condors.When that reactor was built, they forced us to help. That's how we knew what was inside the reactor.I knew this day would come, so after the Shinra left, I sneaked in and took the materia.I didn't mean to fool you, but I guess that's how it ended up. I'm really sorry.
CidJust forget about it. Anyway, we're still alive.
I see. If you put it that way...... we're really grateful.
CidSo the last Huge Materia that Shinra's after's in the underwater reactor in Junon?

BarretWe gotta get there first and beat 'em no matter what!
NanakiWe must get there before them and stop them!
YuffieWe gotta get there and stop 'em...
VincentGetting to the reactor before them...

CidBut ya know, Shinra's probably on high alert since we always mess with 'em.How 'bout we take a break and go see that little fella for a bit?

BarretYou mus' mean Cloud......
NanakiYou mean, Cloud...?
YuffieCloud, right...?
Cait SithYou must mean Mr. Cloud......

CidYeah, I'm worried 'bout Tifa; she may've collapsed takin' care of the guy.How 'bout checkin' in on 'em! Down to Mideel!"
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Huh? What's this?
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Damn man, it's Huge Materia."
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Gotta have that materia!
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Hmm, you mean this?"
Vincent,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,This is......

Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"But ya know, Shinra's probably on high alert since we always mess with 'em.How 'bout we take a break and go see that little fella for a bit?"
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,You mus' mean Cloud......
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"You mean, Cloud...?"
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Cloud, right...?"
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,You must mean Mr. Cloud......
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Yeah, I'm worried 'bout Tifa; she may've collapsed takin' care of the guy.How 'bout checkin' in on 'em! Down to Mideel!"
Man,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,...... Even if you could only spare them......
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,God! What the hell happened here!?
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,He's still alive.
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Where are we?
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Oh good, they're still alive."
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Oy! What on earth happened?
Vincent,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Seems like we survived.
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Damn!! I can't stand this!
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Oh man...... You look like hell.
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,......not enough strength.
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Well, I'm just glad we're all alive."
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Things sure don't go smoothly.
Vincent,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,We might have understimated the situation.
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"This ain't no joke, Jack."
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Oh man, this is real bad."
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Things don't seem too favorable.
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,I told you I'm not kidding!
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"It'd be one thing if it was a joke, but this's the truth."
Vincent,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,This is a rather harsh reality.
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,It's Huge Materia that the Shinra's after...... The only one left is in the underwater reactor in Junon.
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,We gotta get there first and protect it!!
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,We must get there first and stop them.
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,We got to get there first and stop them......
Vincent,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,We've got to get there first and stop them.
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Yeah, but ever since we got in their way the last time, they should've gotten a little more cautious.I doubt they'll fly right into action. I'm more concerned about him that anything else."
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Cloud, it's you......"
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Yes, it's you Cloud......"
Yuffie,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,It is you Cloud......
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Cloud......
Vincent,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Cloud, it's you......"
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Yeah, and I'm worried that even Tifa's gonna fall over on her butt.Let's go back and see what's happening?...... to Mideel..."
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Where shall we go next? Shall we head for the Corel reactor?
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Hey......It's tough being the leader.Cloud did a great job. Sheesh......Shall we go to Mideel to check on things?
Barret,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"Yo, wanna see what Tifa and the gang are doing?"
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Say Cid.I wonder how Tifa and Cloud...... are doing.
Cait Sith,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Shinra's...... stopped.Now we've got to be careful. I know Heidegger and his gang are plotting something.
Vincent,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,"You look really tired, maybe you're ready to give up being leader?"
Pilot in training (LV7),Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Yaaah! Shall we take off?
Cid,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,- Roger- Negative
Pilot in training (LV7),Fort Condor - Huge Materia,Man! We're taking off!
Nanaki,Fort Condor - Huge Materia,I wonder how Cloud's doing.I wonder if Tifa needs a break......I could look after him instead.
Old Man at Entrance,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Ahoy! This here's Mideel. A quiet Hot Springs town... At least it used to be...Lately the sea's been in a tizzy. Lifestream has been mixin' things up at the bottom of the ocean.I think the planet's pretty angry too. We've pretty much done whatever we've wanted to the planet up till now.
Woman,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"It's bad enough with earthquakes and Meteor, but on top of all that now the Lifestream has become active again, too.I hope it doesn't blow and cause a panic like it did before. That was really bad, I tell ya."
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Damn, why the hell did they make something tricky like this?"
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Huh...? The hell's this?Looks like a key but it's stuck way down inside, and I can't get it out.Well, what the hell? That's life..."
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,No good... Someone must've locked it.
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Okay, there's gotta be a way to get it out.Maybe if I move this a bit...... and push that over...... HAH! Gotcha!"
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Hey, I know what'll do it... Let's try that beat up old key!- Use the beat up old key!- Forget it"
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Is something wrong......?
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Ulp!!Oh, uh, no, uh I......Damn, this's bad...- What the hell... lie!- Just apologize and get it over with!"
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Oh... why, thank you very much."
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Phew... that was a close one. But I kinda feel a little bad about that one......
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Huh? Key? You mean the one to that door?
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Hah, hah, hah! That's a good one!"
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"???
ShopkeeperOf course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.
Say what? You drew that door on the wall?
ShopkeeperThat's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this.
Oh, uh... well Thanks.
 and the others received ""Cursed Ring""!
ShopkeeperIf possible, we're hoping to pass through a dream door like that one into another worldI got the feeling that you all might be able to make my dreams come true in my place. Weird, isn't it?"
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Of course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Say what? You drew that door on the wall?
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"That's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this."
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Oh, uh... well Thanks."
Shopkeeper,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"If possible, we're hoping to pass through a dream door like that one into another worldI got the feeling that you all might be able to make my dreams come true in my place. Weird, isn't it?"
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"What's this!? Your bein' awful friendly.Oh, so that's it. You want the Samolen Greens... don't you?- Give it some Samolen Greens- Don't give it any"
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Well, guess there's no way around it. Here ya go, shrimp. Eat up."
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Heh heh, hey he's kinda cute. Aw, maybe I'll just tickle him a little.- Tickle his feet- Tickle his stomach- Tickle his neck- Tickle his belly button- Tickle behind his ears- Tickle under his arms"
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Sheesh, you scared me. I thought you croaked!!"
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Sorry, shorty. But I can't give ya any."
Old Man Playing with Dog,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"I gotta feelin' something bad's gonna happen. Is it gonna be okay?I'm all right. I've lived a long, full life.But I'm worried about my son and his family living in that far-off town...I hope they're safe..."
Old Man Playing with Dog,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Wait a minute.Did you take something just now?
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Uh, oh. I'm......- Yeah, I took it old man!- Don't know nothin' 'bout it!"
Old Man Playing with Dog,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Heh, heh. What an oddball. We'll let him use it."
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Hey thanks. It'll help, pops!"
Old Man Playing with Dog,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"What the hell happened to the rotten old elixir I was gonna throw out?If someone took that by mistake it'll do more than make them sick...Well, if you don't know then I guess you don't know."
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,...............
Old Man,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,So how is the boy? Poor kid. He sure got the worst of whatever it was......Sure hope he gets better soon. Right now is when he really needs to hold on and not give up.
Bald Man,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"It's amazing he recovered. When they carried him here after they first discovered him, I thought for sure he was a goner.That boy must have one powerful guardian angel watchin' over him."
Doctor,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"I'm sorry...... But your friend's condition remains unchanged......You'll have to be patient and wait this out. These things take time. Just like fine wine, time is of the essence."
Nurse,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"(after one Huge Materia mission)Oh, hello. She always stays right by his side. She must really love him.Remember, even at a time like this you can never give up hope. You've got to be strong like her."
Nurse,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"(after both missions)She's finally beginning to look a little tired... I hope she's all right.No change in his condition, and still she stays there doing her best. It must be tough on her.If she keeps this up she'll probably get sick......"
Nurse,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Well anyhow...... Hey, you all look terrible. Why don't you rest up for a while?"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,uh...... a...... aah...............What...... What number...... am I?Uh...... aaa......?A billion mirror fragments...... small...... light......taken...... angel's...... singing voices............ zeno...... gias......Uh...... aaa......?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,(after one Huge Materia mission)Cloud...... I don't understand a word he's saying......I'm such a fool...... I thought there was something that I could do for him......
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"(after both missions)......it's no use...... I don't understand a thing, Cloud.What should I do......? What if you never recover for the rest of your life?"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Eyaaah!?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,......They're...... They're...... coming......!!
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"What did you say, Cloud!?"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Uh...... aaa......?
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Damn. What the hell's goin' on!?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,No way...... Is this......!?
Doctor,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,This isn't good!! It's big!
Nurse,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Eyaaah! I hate earthquakes!!
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,What's this...!?The Lifestream is gushing up from below the surface of the earth!
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Damn, that's......!? This is bad......!!"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,(at the door)Cid......!? What's wrong?
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"N, nothin'!! You and Cloud get inside quick!!"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,But I......!?
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Hey, don't worry about a thing. I ain't about to die that easily."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Be careful...!
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Okay, here I go! Watch this!!"
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Damn!! That &%$^%$ Weapon!!Of all the times to show up......!OK then, come on!! You &$^%$!"
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,You &^$#&$#! You tryin' to escape?
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Damn, man. Just a little bit more an' I woudda smashed him......"
Nanaki,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Just a little more and I would have beaten him.
Yuffie,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"I swear, next time, that guy's dead meat!"
Cait Sith,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"No matter how many lives I get, it ain't enough!"
Vincent,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Hmm...... Looks like escape is their best skill.
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Looks like the Lifestream's settled down now too.
Nanaki,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,It looks like the Lifestream has settled as well.
Yuffie,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Well at least the Lifestream's back to normal.
Cait Sith,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Looks like the Lifestream's back under control too.
Vincent,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,And the Lifestream also appears to be normal.
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Damn, you gotta be kiddin'......!!Th, this's bad......! The main stream is kickin' up!!Somethin' way bigger than that last one is on its way!!No good!! Get outta here......!!"
Nanaki,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,But what about Tifa and Cloud!?
Yuffie,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,But what about Tifa and Cloud......!?
Cait Sith,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,But what about Cloud and the others......!?
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Goddammit!!You don't have time to worry about anyone other than yourself! You don't know when that stream'll blow......Whoa!!There's no time, hurry!!"
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Tifa!! Cloud!! Get outta here!!
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"This is bad...... The tremors are getting worse.Wait a minute, Cloud.Doctor! Shouldn't we move him somewhere rather than stay here...?"
Doctor,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Hmm...... It might be safer to take refuge in a wide open space.
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Don't you worry about a thing, Cloud......I'll see to it that you get somewhere safe!"
Doctor,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,No! The structure can't take it!! Hurry!
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Yes!Ready Cloud? We're leaving now!!
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Wh, where am I......? what's happening? I......?"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Huh...... what......? Who......?Who is it......? I can't hear......
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Cloud, help me!!Eyaaaaghh......!!"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,............ Where am I......?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Cloud!?What is it, Cloud? What is this......!?Is this the inside of your dreams? Or is it...... your...... subconsciousness......?You're searching, aren't you Cloud?Searching...... for yourself......I can help too. We'll work together to try and get the real you back!But...... Where do we start......?"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,(sitting by the well)That starry night at the well...... The promise we made that night...... What if that memory was all a lie?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,(sitting outside the window)............ a sealed up secret...... wish......Tender feelings...... that no one can ever know......
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"The gates of Nibelheim... Five years ago, Sephiroth passed through these gates......And...... That's how it all started......"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"It connects...... to Nibelheim......?That's right... It's probably best to start from there......Let's go have a look, Cloud. I know it's not easy...... But I'll be right with you......"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Cloud... look.Here's the well...And that's Gramps' Inn, too.The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little kids, right?This is the Nibelheim you remember, right?It's the same as my Nibelheim. That's why this place is...... our Nibelheim."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Five Years ago... two men from SOLDIER came...Sephiroth and...... a young and vibrant soldier.Can you tell me again what happened?
Sephiroth,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,How does it feel?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Five Years ago... I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first time.
Sephiroth,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?So how does it feel?I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown..."
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Ummm... how 'bout your parents?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,So this is... the Great Sephiroth.
Sephiroth,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father...
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"But to tell you the truth, I thought he was very cold."
Sephiroth,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"What does it matter...?All right, let's go."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"I remember, I felt a foreboding about him."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"No, Cloud.I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you... something terrible might happen.But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,You weren't here. Cloud did not come to Nibelheim five years ago.
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"I... waited. But, Cloud... never came.The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another person..."
Sephiroth,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"All right, let's go."
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth wasn't...... ......?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"There's nothing...... I can say......You must find the answer yourself......If you can't...... Then you......Take your time, Cloud. Slowly...... little by little, okay?"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,That starry night at the well...... And our promise that night... What if the memory was just a lie?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Don't hurry, Cloud...... Don't answer too quickly.Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come back...... Slowly...... little by little.......Right... like the sky that night...... the heavens were filled with stars......"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,From the beginning... OK?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Try and remember, Cloud."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Right, I was wearing these clothes.That's you, too. You were so small then......"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Cloud, what about your other memories?No, not memories.A memory is something that has to be consciously recalled, right?That's why sometimes it can be mistaken and a different thing......But it's different from a memory locked deep within your heart......That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that memory......That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me?I say something and you don't remember it......But you say something, and I remember it, too... Then we'll know that's our memory......Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you...Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the first place?I always thought it was a sudden decision you made......"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,......I was devastated. ......I wanted to be noticed.I thought if I got stronger I could get someone to notice......
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Someone to notice you...? ......who?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,You......
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,......Me? Why!?
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Tifa...... did you forget...... about those days?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Look...... I......I'm sorry...... But what are you talking about?
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"No...... it's all right. You were having a hard time back then.You were so busy with your own things, it's only natural you don't remember me back then."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,'Back then'?
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,It's important to me...... I hate to say it but... It's a very important memory......Do you want to see it?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,(sitting by the well)A promise under a starry sky... But what if even that was a memory that Tifa imagined......?
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Come on, hurry."
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,......a sealed up secret...... wish......Tender memories...... no one can ever know......
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Do you know where this window goes to, Tifa?Fine...... I'll go."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,My room?
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,It was my first time there.
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Was... it?
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,I only used to look up at it from outside.
Boy,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Hey, look!Cloud's coming!"
Boy,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,You think he wants to come in?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Was that the first day you came into my room?...that's right.We lived next to each other.But I really didn't know you that well.I've known you since we were children and always thought we were close...Now that you mention it... I don't recall you ever being in my room...
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Tifa always used to be with this three-some.
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,...That's right.
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,I used to think... they were all stupid.
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,What!?
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"You were all childish, laughing at every little stupid thing."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"But we were children, back then."
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"...I know. I'm the one that was stupid.I really wanted to play with everyone, but I was never allowed into the group.Then later... I began to think I was different...That I was different from those immature kids.That then... maybe..."
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,I was so prejudiced. And... weak.
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Yeah... it was so sudden. I was... a bit surprised.But...It's true that we weren't THAT close, but...After you left town, I really thought about you a lot.I used to wonder how Cloud was doing.I wonder if Cloud was able to get into SOLDIER?I started reading the newspapers, thinking that there might be an article about you."
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Thanks, Tifa.Tell him what you told me, later. He'll probably be so happy."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,OK!Huh?What happened on this day? Was it a special day?
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,This was the day...
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,The day Mom died...
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,I want... to see... mom...
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,...I wonder if there's anything beyond that mountain?
Boys,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Mt. Nibel is scary. Many people have died there.No one crosses that mountain alive...
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,How 'bout those that died?Did mama pass through the mountains?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"I don't remember the path I walked.Tifa missed her step. I ran to her... but didn't make it in time.Both of us fell off the cliff.Back then, I only scarred my knees but......"
Tifa's Father,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Cloud! Why'd you bring Tifa to a place like this!What the hell's the matter with you!?What if she dies!?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Tifa was in a coma for seven days.We all thought she wouldn't make it.If only I could've saved her...I was so angry... Angry at myself for my weakness.Ever since then, I felt Tifa blamed me...I got out of control... I'd get into fights not even caring who it was."
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"That was the first time I heard about Sephiroth.If I got strong like Sephiroth, then everyone might..."
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,If I could just get stronger...... Then even Tifa would have to notice me......
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"So that was it......Sorry, Cloud.If I had only remembered more clearly what happened, I could have done something sooner......"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"It's not your fault, Tifa."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"But, I remember back when we were eight!That's it! Now I know!You weren't created five years ago.My childhood memories weren't all made up!Hang in there Cloud! Just a little longer! You've almost found the real you!Let's go back to Nibelheim again......!"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,The truth is right there. We almost have the answer right in the palm of our hands.
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Cloud, wait.Where are you going?"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,......The reactor......?To the reactor! The Mako reactor of five years ago!
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Hey! It's Cloud!
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Za...... ck...... Zac......k. Zack...
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,You remembered!!
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"That's right! It was Zack who came to Nibelheim with Sephiroth!Then, where were you, Cloud?"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Cloud... Did you... see it all?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,I saw... everything...
Sephiroth,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Aaarrrgh...... who... who are you?
Soldier,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Mom... Tifa...... my town... give it back...I had so much respect for you... I admired you...
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Cloud!?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,That's what happened...
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,...You were there.You were watching me.
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Yeah, I remember.Hmm... so it was you."
Zack,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Hey Cloud, if you're feeling sick, why don't you take that mask off?"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Yeah......
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Yeah... This is... me.I... never made it as a member of SOLDIER.I even left my hometown telling everyone I was going to join, but...I was so embarrassed...... I didn't want to see anybody..."
Sephiroth,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"How does it feel?It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,I'm...
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,...You came. ...You kept your promise.So you really did come when I was in trouble!
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Sorry... I didn't get there... fast enough...
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,It's all right... Cloud.
Sephiroth,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Just like you.
Zack,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Cloud... Kill Sephiroth...
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Sephiroth!!
Sephiroth,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Don't... push... your luck...
Sephiroth,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,...It can't be!
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Cloud......
Young Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Then... this is goodbye, Tifa. Until we meet again......"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,............!?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Cloud!!
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Uh...... Ah, Uh......!"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Oh, Cloud......! It's really you, isn't it?"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Yeah...... Tifa...... We finally...... meet again......
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,You stupid jerk!! You had us all worried sick!!
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Krgh......!
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Cloud!? Are you all right!?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"V, voice...... Their......"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"I see. We're... in the Lifestream aren't we?Everyone's waiting.Let's go back, Cloud. Back to everyone......"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Yeah, I guess so... Come on, Tifa. Let's go home......"
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Yo! You awright!? Tifa!?
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,u... unn......?
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Don't worry about him. He's a tough one.
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Barret...... I...... When I was in the Lifestream I saw the real Cloud.I mean, I didn't really find him. Cloud found himself on his own..."
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Awright, I know... I shouldn't have doubted him.But I can't win against you. You're some kinda lady."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,People have so many things pent up inside of themselves...And they can forget so many things......Strange...... isn't it............
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Yo, Tifa! Snap outta it!!Tifa......!?"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Everyone...... I'm sorry. I don't know what to say......
Nanaki,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Don't say anything, Cloud. All you've been doing is apologizing."
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"I never was in SOLDIER.I made up the stories about what happened to me five years ago, about being in SOLDIER.I left my village looking for glory, but never made it in to SOLDIER......I was so ashamed of being so weak; then I heard this story from my friend Zack...And I created an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen in my life......And I continued to play the charade as if it were true."
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Illusion, huh...? Pretty damn strong for a 'lusion, I'd say."
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"I'm physically built like someone in SOLDIER.Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult.It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of SOLDIER.You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy.Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells......For better or worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER.It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion.But weak people...... like me, get lost in the whole thing.The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my own weakness are what created me.Everyone knew that. I'm...... .......the master of my own illusionary world.But I can't remain trapped in an illusion any more......I'm going to live my life without pretending."
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"You're sure messed up, Cloud!"
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,That means there ain't no difference from before!
Cait Sith,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"By the way, Cloud. What are you going to do now?Don't tell me you're going to leave the ship?"
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,......I'm the reason why Meteor is falling towards us.That's why I have to do everything in my power to fight this thing.
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Good!! Then you're gonna keep fightin' to save the planet!?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"It's like you always told me, Barret."
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Oh, uh, you mean that!"
Nanaki,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,What? I don't understand!
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,The train we on don't make no stops!
Crew Member,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Oh...... oh...... Cloud......
Crew Member,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Cloud, I was deeply moved by your story!I'm really a weak person and so I could really understand how you feel, Cloud!No one knows when fighting will begin. But let's get ready!"
Cait Sith,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Listen, Cloud.We're right in the middle of the mission for the Huge Materia, right?I know this's kinda outta the blue, but there's a underwater reactor at Junon.As far as I can see, that's the only one left.That's that. Let's go!"
Barret,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"C'mon, Cloud! Don't #&$* around!We're goin' to Junon, boyeee!!"
Tifa,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Let's do our best, Cloud!"
Nanaki,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,I'm glad you're back with us!
Cait Sith,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"This's kinda on the spur o' the moment, but shouldn't we oughta get to Junon!?"
Vincent,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Escape from a world of illusions... Hmph... I wonder which is better...?
Cid,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"I know how tough it is bein' a leader, because I've been one.I always forget who has what materia."
Crew Members,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Ahhhhh! Oh no, oh no, oh no!Sorry, I'm in the middle of a very delicate operation!"
Yuffie,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Huh?How would you even know? You don't know how tough it is... getting sick on boats and rides......So, please...... just leave me alone."
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"......I really do understand, Yuffie. When I get sick on a flight, it's a real killer.When I was in SOLDIER, I completely forgot about my motion sickness."
Yuffie,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Oh......Isn't there any way to prevent this?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Well, according to my research......First off, if you're nervous a lot, you won't get sick.But you can't always be nervous.With this much space, your best bet is to move around while you're riding.It also might be a good idea to stretch sometimes, too.But in SOLDIER, we spent a lot of time in trucks.That sucked!......And there's one thing you mustn't do when riding.And that is......Read!Once you get sick, there's nothing anyone can do.I know it's tough......"
Yuffie,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"......so you're a little better off than me.But I don't feel...... well.Where's the next stop? Can't you get there any quicker?Cloud, put me in your party, so I can get off this ship."
Crew Member,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!Oh, yeah, yeah. Are you using Chocobos?I mean, just loading them up and transporting them."
Crew Member in Chocobo Stable,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,That's a good Chocobo.
Learner Pilot (L8),Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,Wanna Go?
Cloud,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,- Yes- No
Old Man at Entrance,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Ahoy! This here's Mideel. As you can see, this used to be a quiet hot springs town.Everything's gone now but in a way, I'm kinda glad everything's cleaned out. Feels better this way, ho, ho."
Bald Man,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Hey, you feelin' all better now? That's good, real good.Now don't overdo yourself like that again, hear?"
Shopper,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Hee, hee. Welcome. It's here. The day's finally come! Your day to shop!!Do we have items and weapons!? Well, I should say so. And here's a bargain! What would you say to 50% off everything?Just kidding. Even I wouldn't do something like that. Now what can I do for you today?Thank you. Come again!"
Doctor,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Hmphf? You...!? How did you recover from your Mako poisoning?This is absolutely amazing...... I am so glad for you! Looks like your friends' wishes came true.You can see for yourself what things look like, but at least no one was seriously hurt. We're just very unhappy now."
Nurse,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"You probably don't remember, but you know that girl that watched over you for so long when you were sick?You'd better take care of her. If you don't, you'll be sorry. Believe you me!Well anyhow...... Hey, you all look terrible. Why don't you rest up for a while?"
Item Shopkeeper,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Welcome! We always welcome cash! What can I do for you today?I'm sorry. Our stock isn't so great now... But that's just the way it is here.If you're looking for other items, why don't you check out the other stores?"
Girl in Blue,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Have you seen my husband? He disappeared during the big earthquake and I haven't seen him since.I thought he'd be in the store......You don't think he got through that door and went to another country on the other side, do you?That's all just a dream...... Nothing like that could ever really happen. Heh..."
Materia Shopkeeper,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Welcome. Just what you need at time like this--a shop of rest and relaxation. What you want?Thank you! We don't have many goods but you coming again, please."
Girl,Mideel - Inside Cloud's Mind,"Oh great. Now I've got to find another job......I guess I might as well make my side job as an accessory seller into my regular job.Well, since you're already here, why don't you buy something to take back with you?Thank you. Stop by again."
Woman,Junon - Huge Materia,They say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world and bringing it to Junon.Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes.I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I think they're going to the off-shore Underwater Reactor.Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia?
Older Man,Junon - Huge Materia,"I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe underwater.The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe.You should be able to get to the reactor through it."
Priscilla,Junon - Huge Materia,Who are you---?Cloud!!Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the Lifestream?
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,"Yeah, that's right."
Priscilla,Junon - Huge Materia,You've gotta be more careful! Because you're going to marry me one day.
Soldier on the Path to the Airport,Junon - Huge Materia,"The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea Reactor!When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport.Get out of here before you get in the way!What... me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get in their way either!"
Soldier,Junon - Huge Materia,"After they get it, they'll take it to the airport and will transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down!"
Soldier 2,Junon - Huge Materia,They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor.
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,"I may be mistaken, but...... Doesn't it feel like we're missing something?"
Commander,Junon - Huge Materia,All right!! Let's see how hard you trained!Attention! Charge--!!
Commander,Junon - Huge Materia,He... hey--!! That's the Underwater Reactor!! Come back!!
Soldier,Junon - Huge Materia,"How 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out?"
Soldier 2,Junon - Huge Materia,"All right, you're on!!But... What if both of us..."
Soldier,Junon - Huge Materia,Whoa!! Don't even talk about that!
Redhead,Junon - Huge Materia,...gulp... (Great... there went two perfectly good men!)
Soldier 3,Junon - Huge Materia,OK! Back to work!! Back to work!!
Soldier 4,Junon - Huge Materia,Yawn... I'm sleepy!!
Soldier 3,Junon - Huge Materia,For Junon!!
Soldiers in Reactor,Junon - Huge Materia,"You, you're Cloud!!You are NOT getting this Huge Materia!!So you WERE after the Huge Materia!"
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,!? The Huge Materia!
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,"Damn, just missed it!"
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,They're gonna take it on that submarine!
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,"If we take a short cut, we might just make it......!"
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,Hey! A Crane Game!
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,There's the submarine dock just ahead of us.
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,We were a little late...
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,That's what you think! ^%$@#&$#!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Did we make it!?
Reno,Junon - Huge Materia,What are you doing? Help load.
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,We're gonna help transport the Huge Materia... Reno!
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,Looks like we barely made it.
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,Help?
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,I'm SURE! You want me to do manual labor?
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,I refuse...
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,You know I don't work for cheap!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Either give it to us or else....which is it gonna be?
Reno,Junon - Huge Materia,"Unfortunately, I don't have time to deal with you.My priority is the Huge Materia!"
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Damn! The submarine!
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,Damn! So they was just buyin' time!?
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,We have to go after it!
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,But it's already in the water!
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,!? The Huge Materia!
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,Oh no! It left the dock...
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,There is one way...
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,Hold on to your horses! Let's get it from them!!
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,"We ain't jes' gonna let them take the Huge Materia, are we?"
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,Cloud--! We have to go after Rude!
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,Aren't we going after the Huge Materia?
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,Wait a sec! What about the Huge Materia---?
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,Hey you! Where ya goin'?
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,"Hey, hey, hey! Where do you think you're goin'?"
Soldiers,Junon - Huge Materia,"Y, you...!You're not taking over this ship!"
Soldiers,Junon - Huge Materia,You want the Sub? Just try an' take it!Um... sir! Maybe we shouldn't piss them off...
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,"Come on, Cloud! Follow me!Damn, man!! ......what the...?Hey yo! Remember I was the leader first, man!Yo! We come a long ways since we got on that train!Lotsa things changed! This and that."
Captain,Junon - Huge Materia,"NO, NO!! This is terrible!"
Soldiers,Junon - Huge Materia,We don't have much time left! I don't want to die!There's still so much more I've got to do!I never even got to do my special victory dance in battle!
Captain,Junon - Huge Materia,"All right!! Then make this your first victory!!Go on, show 'em!!"
Soldiers,Junon - Huge Materia,"Yes, sir!!"
Captain,Junon - Huge Materia,Remember your last training. Begin!!
Soldiers,Junon - Huge Materia,"Yes, sir!!"
Captain,Junon - Huge Materia,I'm back! An' now I got no regrets!!ATT----ACK!!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Hmmmm...- Fight them- Take them prisoner
Captain,Junon - Huge Materia,Let me show you how it's done.
Soldier,Junon - Huge Materia,Eyaaarrrgh!Captain... I can't hold on any longer!Eyaaarrrgh!
Captain,Junon - Huge Materia,Uggh... They got me.
Soldier 2,Junon - Huge Materia,The Special Pose...
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,"Someone... please. I'm sorry I can't take it anymore.The lack of space, the shaking, the roar of the engine..."
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,Stop your blubberin'!! How we gonna move this without you?
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,What are we going to do... We stole a submarine but can't pilot it.
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,My legs can't budge it.
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,I... I can't... I'm history.
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,I can't fit in this seat... No good!
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,Better hurry. Reno's getting away.
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,DAMN-SAM! I've GOT to get back in the air!
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,Arrrrrrrgh!!EY!! Looks likes we're almost on our way! Just keep on fiddlin' with it!!It's all up to you!
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,"See!?Just fiddle with the controls, and we'll get somewhere!Hey Cloud? Why don't you try piloting it?They say you don't get motion sickness if you're driving."
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,It moved!Cloud!! Try it!
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,"HEY---! It's movin'!Oh man, this sucks!! Cloud, do something!"
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,"It's movin'--- Keep it up, Cloud!"
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,"I'm not very mechanical, but it seems like we're starting to move.Hang in there."
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,Hunka junk... just gotta do this!SEE! Now you take over!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,"Hey, you're right... I DO feel a little better driving.No sweat. Just leave everything to me."
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,"Don't worry!If it breaks down, I'll smack it one--that'll fix it!"
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,"You can do it, Cloud!"
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,Cloud!! Try it!
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,"I'll hold my breath, so HURRY!"
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,"Oh please drive safely, Cloud!"
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,Shinra's technology is really something.
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,I'll be watchin' from here!
Soldiers,Junon - Huge Materia,I thank you! I am happy to be a hostage!Piloting a submarine is very difficult! I am completely clueless!
Captain,Junon - Huge Materia,Hey! Who am I to know!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,"Well, now what?- Read the manual- Sit in the seat- Leave it alone"
Submarine Operation Manual - Beginner's Edition,Junon - Huge Materia,
Submarine Operation Manual - Intermediate's Edition,Junon - Huge Materia,"Radar Screen: The mines are found at the top of the indicators on the screen.The basic strategies are to 1) avoid the indicators, and 2) ""Lock On"" to enemies from behind.The lower gauge shows the sub's remaining power. The right gauge shows the sub's speed. Other warnings are as follows...WARNING... Enemy submarine detected nearby!ALERT... Approaching torpedo detected!MINE... Mine detected nearby!CONFLICT... Collisison with the ocean floor!"
Submarine Operation Manual - Advanced Edition,Junon - Huge Materia,
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Everything seems set...- Read the manual- Start the mission!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,This switch...?
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Phew--! We did it!!The Huge Materia should be at the bottom of the sea by now. Let's continue the search...
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Hmm...? ...Must be from Shinra.
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,Is it us?
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,No. 2......I saw that written at the dock! They must mean this sub.
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,We're Submarine No. 2
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,Oh my gawd...! They mean us.
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,We need to respond!
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,We've no choice but to respond.
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,Make 'em shut up! Just answer somethin'!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,"All right, I'll do it.This is Shinra No. 2... Everything's normal."
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Junon Airport... We should make it if we hurry.Forget about the Huge Materia for now.We're climbing!
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,Shit! What's all this 'Climbing!' crap? Gimme a break!
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,"Aye, aye... CAPTAIN!"
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,Take o-ff!
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,Climbing...arrrgh...my ears...! LET ME OUT---I HATE THIS---
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,We gotta hurry!
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,"First the ocean, now the air... What a busy day."
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,The airport? No sweat!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,We're gettin' outta here!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Hear that? Junon Airport!We can still get the Huge Materia back! Let's hurry!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,We're breakin' out of here!
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,Whatcha gonna do!?
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,But how? We're at the bottom of the sea!!
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,I can't swim...
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,"I wanna get outta here, now!"
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,What we gonna do?
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,We're at the bottom of the sea.
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,Damn! What are we gonna do!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,We're gonna hop on a torpedo and blast outta here!Don't worry! I won't miss!We don't even have a target. We're just aiming for the sky.
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Old man...
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,Yo!! Junon airport?
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,Just in time!Come on! Let's go to the airport!
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,Ugh. It's salty! Let's go to the airport!
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,Phew... The air up here is great!Hey! Let's go to the airport!
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,Let's go to the airport!
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,"It seems as though we made it. You'll probably head for the airport, right?"
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,God!! I'm drenched!Hurry up! Let's get to the airport!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Hmm... Junon.I'd love to get my hands on a submarine right now.
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,Yeah! I could go for that! Let's go to the submarine dock under Junon!
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,There should only be a few guards now.It might be safe to go to the submarine dock under Junon.
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,I would like to ride it! Let's get one from the submarine dock beneath Junon!
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,"...Yeah!!The submarine dock underneath Junon! I can steal sub easy enough, but forget about me piloting it!"
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,Security's pretty light now! The submarine's at the submarine dock!
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,It should be alright.
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,You want it? Then you gotta have it! They're down at the submarine dock underneath Junon! You gotta get what you want while you can!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Let's go...
Soldiers,Junon - Huge Materia,"This is the Junon Submarine Dock!If you want to enter, please talk to my dog.That's all the instructions you're going to get! Let's go!!"
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,"Damn, Shinra dogs!!We'll take that submarine!! Out of our way!!"
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Shinra dog...!!- Ignore it- Dognap it!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Feelin' lonely!? You'd better get back to your master.
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Shinra dog!! I'm gonna dognap you!!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Those attackers won't bother us now.
Soldier,Junon - Huge Materia,P... Please!! Spare me!!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Hmm......- Take them all hostage- Fight them
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Be grateful. I'm taking you prisoner.
Soldiers,Junon - Huge Materia,You're pretty nice!Thank you!
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Don't think we're weak.
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,We can't go back after coming this far.
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,"An unconditional surrender, huh?- I'm your prisoner- Don't bet on it..."
Captain,Junon - Huge Materia,Let me show you how it's done.
Soldier,Junon - Huge Materia,Captain... I can't hold on any longer!Eyaaarrrgh!
Captain,Junon - Huge Materia,Uggh... They got me.
Soldier 2,Junon - Huge Materia,The Special Pose...
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,We'll hide it somewhere secluded.
Fisherman,Junon - Huge Materia,It seems like there's something going on again up there.Is that huge plane going to take off again with that deafening roar?
Older Man,Junon - Huge Materia,I just saw some Shinra soldiers all huddled together discussing something.They said a plane carrying Huge Materia would be taking off from the airport above.
Soldier on the Path to the Airport,Junon - Huge Materia,"Finished loading the Huge Materia!All we have to do now is to ready the cargo ship, 'Gelnika', for departure and we're done!"
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Oh no! The Huge Materia...
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,Let's go after it!
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,Can't we go after it?
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,Let's get there before they do and catch 'em!
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,How 'bout us getting there beforehand and stealing it back?
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,Let's go after it.
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,Grrrrgh! Just barely! We're goin' after it!
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,But where to?
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,Where are they headed?
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,Where's their destination?
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,"Hey, where? Where? Where are they headed?"
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,Where is it flying to?
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,Where is their destination...?
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,Where's that thing headed?
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,"Rocket Town, of course."
Soldier,Junon - Huge Materia,"Whew... I hope everything goes all right until we get to Rocket Town. Then, our mission is nearly complete."
Soldier 2,Junon - Huge Materia,Not so fast. We still have one major task... we still have to transport the stuff...
Soldier,Junon - Huge Materia,The stuff...
Soldier on the Path to the Airport,Junon - Huge Materia,I'm glad we got Gelnika to the Rocket Town safely.But they sure think big. Looks like they're going to use the Huge Materia's to break up Meteor...
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,So this is the Leader Sub...Damn...... makes me sick just thinking about it...
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,...Phew... That's good to hear.
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,This is the Shinra's Gelnika type airplane... I wonder why it went down here?
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,What is this place...? Must be some kind of a Research Establishment because there's a Mako generator?
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Turks!?
Rude,Junon - Huge Materia,...again?
Reno,Junon - Huge Materia,We just seem to keep running into each other lately!There were weapons and Materia developed solely to destroy Sephiroth.
Rude,Junon - Huge Materia,"...but, it was attacked by Weapon and sunk to the bottom of the sea."
Reno,Junon - Huge Materia,I can't give you what's here. We'll take out Sephiroth.I guess this is our last meeting.
Rude,Junon - Huge Materia,I won't let you get in our way.
Reno,Junon - Huge Materia,These guys are pretty tough.
Rude,Junon - Huge Materia,..................
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,"So Shinra's new, secret weapon was on this Airship..."
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,This must be the Cargo Room...This is terrible... It's all messed up...
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,It looks like a key to somewhere...It seems really old.
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,Several thousand years... ...Ancients?
Barret,Junon - Huge Materia,Them Shinra guys think they're gonna fight Meteor with the Huge Materia?
Tifa,Junon - Huge Materia,How are you feeling?You ought to rest a bit... Don't push yourself.
Nanaki,Junon - Huge Materia,"Shinra only cares if things are good right now.But, I plan to live for 500 years and won't stand for that type of thinking."
Cait Sith,Junon - Huge Materia,Them Shinra's ar' all gathered at Cid's Rocket Town...Yep... there ain't nuthin' I like more than lettin' out secrets.
Vincent,Junon - Huge Materia,"...how does it feel, Cloud? Living for yourself and not someone else?"
Cid,Junon - Huge Materia,You said there's somethin' goin' on at Rocket Town...?
Yuffie,Junon - Huge Materia,Hmph!......I wonder why anyone would ever make an airship like this......Ugh...... ugh......
Learner Pilot (L9),Junon - Huge Materia,Wanna go?
Cloud,Junon - Huge Materia,- Go- Don't go
Barkeeper,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Seems like Palmer of Shinra, Inc. ordered soldiers to restore the rocket..."
Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Even with all this goin' on outside, that guy still won't come out of the bathroom? He must be a damn water tank!?"
Mechanic,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,What's young president Rufus doing by getting all those mechanics together?
Redhead,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,The Shinra serious 'bout launching that piece of crap rocket? But why now...?
Old Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,There's a bunch of Shinra people here messin' with the rocket...Is my rocket... all right?
Old Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Hey Cid! I just thought of the best joke! Listen to this one.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"I'm so sick of hearing these dumb puns, but okay... let's get it over with. Go on... let me hear it."
Old Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Uh, now, let's see, how did it go......He's crude an' a jerk...I mean, He's Rude of the Turks!"
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,......??
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,And?
Old Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"President Rufus, lathers Tantrics...Uh, I mean... President Rufus, gathers mechanics...Raunchy meat, a pocket full, at the cafeteria. Uh, I mean... Launch a beat up rocket full of Materia."
"Barret, Tifa, Nanaki, Yuffie, Cait Sith, or Vincent",Rocket Town - Huge Materia,(A fearful sense of humor...)
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,(The problem starts way before his sense of humor.)
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,...I thought it might be fun to hear some of your stupid puns again for old times sake... my mistake.
Old Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Oh, 'crap-again' (oh, captain)."
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Dammit! That does it!
Old Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,How rude...
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Rude, hell! You're the one who always cracks those #$##@& jokes!"
Old Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,(lying on the floor)Ugh... Nice kick.
Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Mmmmm, a SPECTACLE."
Woman,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Is something about to happen? Oh, I'm getting excited."
Soldiers,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Those terrorists are here!
Commander,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Don't let them get any further! Everyone, ATTACK---!"
Commander,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Urrrgh, you're not going anywhere! Uh un, nowhere!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Wait, Cloud!If you're gonna kick those *#$% Shinra out of my rocket, then take me with you!ALL RIGHT! Let's show those &$!@& Shinra!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Goddammit, what the hell do they think they're gonna do to my rocket!?I'm outta here, Cloud! I'm gonna kick those $^%$# Shinra right out of my rocket!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Cloud, what are you doin'!? There gonna launch the rocket!!"
Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Mmmm, here comes some hard action!"
Woman,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"What? You guys are terrorists? Wow, that's kinda exciting!"
Rude,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,...you again?...We will eliminate everyone who gets in Shinra's way.
Rude,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Ugh......... gh...............they got us....hmm.
Commander,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,You... you! Why are you here? Rude of the Turks should've been here!!
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Too bad. Those guys are over there.
Commander,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Oh man... the Turks, being done in like that... But, I won't let you through!"
Commander,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,urrrrgh...
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Hey! What the hell're you guys doin'!?
Mechanic 1,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Hey! Just when I thought somethin' was goin' on, you come back!"
Mechanic 3,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Listen to me, Captain. We're gonna launch this rocket!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Huh? What are you talkin' 'bout?
Mechanic 2,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,We're gonna load a Materia bomb in this and blow up Meteor.
Mechanic 1,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Our rocket's gonna save the planet!
Mechanic 2,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Urrrrgh. Man this is so COOL!!
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Wait a minute!
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Shut up!! Just shut the hell up!
Mechanic 1,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,It's pretty much OK.
Mechanic 2,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,But...
Mechanic 3,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"We planned to run it into Meteor on Auto-Pilot, but the most important device is broken."
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Broken? How's the repair goin'?
Mechanic 3,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Shera's doin' it...
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Oh great! What a buncha wizards you guys are! She's gonna take a 100 years!I'll take over, so don't worry about the Auto-Pilot!Hey, go ahead! Go tell everyone!"
Mechanics,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"All right, Captain. Good luck."
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Hey, Cid! What're you doing!?There are generations of knowledge and wisdom inside the Materia.We're gonna borrow their powers and save the planet from Sephiroth.There's no way that we can lose the Huge Materia. You understand that, right?"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Yeah, I understand. I understand that Materia is precious, and I also understand what you're thinking.But listen.I don't give a rat's ass whether it's science or magical power.No, I guess if I had to choose, I'd rather put my money on the power of science.Humans who used to only roam around on the ground are able to fly now!And finally, we're about to go into outer space.Science is a ""Power"" created and developed by humans. And science just might be what saves this planet.I was able to earn my living thanks to science. So to me, there's nothing greater!Now quit your worrying 'bout what Shinra's gonna do!I don't want to regret not having done something later."
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"But, Cid......"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Shut the hell up!! I don't wanna hear it!!Alright, time to get to work! Anyone who ain't involved, get the hell outta here!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,What the hell......? What the hell happened!?
Palmer,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,(over the intercom)Hey-hey!
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Palmer! What the hell did'ya do!?
Palmer,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"They said they finished repairing the Auto-Pilot. So, I laun---ched it!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Goddamn Shera! Why'd she pick today to get fast!
Palmer,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Hey-hey-hey! Almost lift off!
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,What the!? No countdown!? It just don't seem the same without it!
Palmer,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Hey!!!! Hey-hey!!! Blast-----off!
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"I finally made it... outer space...Let's see, how's the course set...?Yup, it's headed for a collision with Meteor."
Barret,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Can't we do somethin'? We can't jus' leave it.
Tifa,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Can't we do something? If it goes on, we're......"
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,What should we do? Are we all going to die?
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Hey old man! Do something!
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"What shall we do? What shall we do?I'm a toy, so I don't care, but for all of you it's a different story..."
Vincent,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,We're in space now. A long rest...
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,That damn Palmer went outta his way to lock the Auto-Pilot device. We might not be able to change the course.
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,...this is the end?
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Huh? What the hell're you sayin'? You're still young, and you give up that easily?I'm not gonna crash into Meteor.Just watch.I keep an Escape Pod on the rocket just for emergencies like this.I deciphered the lock code on the Escape Pod. We'll bail right before we crash into Meteor."
Barret,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Hey wait a second!What's gonna happen to the Huge Materia?
Tifa,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Hey, what about the Huge Materia?"
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"But, what are we going to do with the Huge Materia? Are we just going to give it up?"
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Hmm? What are we gonna do with the Huge Materia?If you don't want it, maybe... you could... give it to ME!"
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"By the way, what are we goin' to do with the Huge Materia?"
Vincent,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Then the remaining question is what to do with the Huge Materia.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"......If you want the Materia, do whatever you want!The Materia should be there after you climb that ladder."
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,...You sure?
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"I dunno...I know what I said a minute ago.But maybe all that I really wanted was just to go into outer space.So, why don't you all do whatever you think is right?"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Hey, Cloud.If you're goin' to get the Materia, it's this way."
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,I finally found the Huge Materia...
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"It's structured so that the lock can be opened if we enter the passcode from this control panel.Hey Cloud, you know how to use it, right?Everytime it says, 'Enter Passcode,' push one of those O X △ ◻ buttons.If you punch in the right code, it'll unlock and you can get the Huge Materia!"
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"So, what order am I supposed to enter the passcode in?"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,I dunno. Just try and punch in the code randomly.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Whoa, pretty good! You got the passcode in a single try!You must've known the passcode. If not, it's impossible."
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Seems like you missed the code!If we don't enter the correct passcode before the Protection System activates, we won't be able to get the Materia back!I heard there's a passcode only the top people in Shinra know.We probably have to enter that. Try and enter some codes while I try and remember that passcode!I think the first digit wasn't a ◻.I think the second digit wasn't an X...The second digit wasn't a △. I'm sure of it!The third digit was an X ......I think.I'm pretty sure that the last digit was a △. No, maybe it was an X...?I have a feeling you push the O only once...Did you use the △? I'm pretty sure you didn't...I think there was a key that you have to push twice...Hmmmmmm, I can't remember. Give me some more time!"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Alright, Cloud!! It's unlocked!Yup, my great advice saved the day."
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Ahhh &$#$#! The Protection System just activated!...Cloud, too bad, but we gotta let it go."
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Grrrgh!Damn! My leg's stuck in the debris......
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Cid!!
Barret,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,...damn! ...can't lift it!
Tifa,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"...I can't! It's so heavy, I can't lift it..."
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,I can't do anything with my strength alone......!
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,I can't budge it by myself!!
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,What shall we do--- It won't budge!
Vincent,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,...no. I can't lift it.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Don't worry 'bout me. Hurry up and go! If you don't hurry, the rocket's gonna crash into Meteor!"
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,...I can't go without my friends.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,You ^%#@&%......! No time to worry 'bout other people!
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,I'm gonna do whatever I can.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"You're stupid. You're really $#&^%$* stupid.Tank Number 8 blew up...... So Tank Number 8... really was malfunctioning......Shera... You were right.But, ......this is the end for me."
Shera,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Don't say that, Cid."
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Huh!? Shera!?
Shera,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,I tagged along. I'm coming to help you.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,You stupid &$#&%*%&%#!!......Sorry.
Shera,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,The Escape Pod is this way. Please hurry.
Shera,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Hurry. I'm going to detach the Escape Pod.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Hey, Shera! Does this Pod really fly?"
Shera,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,It'll be OK. I've been checking it till now.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,.........Then I'm relieved.
Shera,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,......Thanks.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"(plastered to the window)So this is...... outer space...Man... it's the real thing... I'm really here in outer space...So long, Shinra No. 26..."
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Rufus and the others plan was a failure...
Barret,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,What a bust... But I kinda hoped it'd work.
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,We been botherin' them as much as we can...But there ain't no other way... Wonder if we've been wrong all this time?
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Makes you worry, doesn't it?"
Tifa,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Don't worry! Think!
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Hey! The girl's right.You start worryin' and there's no stoppin' it! Things just start fallin' apart and get worse and worse.
Barret,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,You're pretty damn optimistic! You up to somethin'?
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Yeah, I been thinkin' about this and that.All the time we been up here lookin' at the planet.I been thinkin' even when we were floatin' in the ocean in that escape pod."
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,I've... been thinking too. About the universe... planet... ocean.How wide and big... No matter where I go and what I do it won't change a thing.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Maybe you're right.But I came up with something different.I always thought this planet was so huge.But lookin' at it from space, I realized it's so small.We're just floatin' in the dark. ......kind of makes you feel powerless.On top of that it's got Sephiroth festerin' inside it like a sickness.That's why I say this planet's still a kid.A little kid sick and trembling in the middle of this huge universe.Someone's gotta protect it.Ya follow me? That someone is us."
Tifa,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Cid... that's beautiful.
Barret,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Yo! Cid! You even got to me!Do, now what? How're we gonna protect the planet from Meteor?"
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,...............I'm still thinkin' about that.
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Huh!?Did you...... hear something?
Tifa,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,The planet's scream...... or Meteor...? Is it this planet?
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Hey, how do we know that this is really the planet's scream?"
Tifa,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Did you forget?Bugenhagen told us.
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Bugenhagen...
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Let's go see Grandfather! To Cosmo Canyon!I'm sure he'll be able to tell us something that will be helpful!
Barret,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"That Bugenhagen guy... He was a weird old dude.I thought he was some kinda naturalist, but he was all into them machines."
Tifa,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Did Bugenhagen...... tell you anything?
Nanaki,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Hurry, hurry! We must go meet Grandfather!"
Cait Sith,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"This's just between you 'n' me but...That there Bugenhagen feller, used to be a pretty handy Shinra worker.Yep, he ain't never bought no weapons or Mako though......"
Vincent,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,The machines in Cosmo Canyon were presents of Dr. Gast.Wrapped up in the planet's strange notions surrounded by Shinra-made machines...Science and the planet lived side by side in that old man's heart.
Cid,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Maybe it's just me, but has this ship been remodeled without me knowin' it?All these switches and levers. They're kinda gettin' to me."
Yuffie,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"What? Are we there?I know it's all for Wutai, But I can't take much more of this."
Learner Pilot (L10),Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Shall we go?
Cloud,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"- Let's- No, let's not"
Barkeeper,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Even though they failed to blow up Meteor with the rocket, the Shinra haven't given up yet...Looks like they're gathering all the weapons from all their bases and are preparing for a final showdown."
Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"OK, which is it gonna be? Meteor hits us first, or that guy comes out of the bathroom?I'm not movin' from this spot till I see it with my own eyes."
Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Even the rocket launch wasn't all THAT great.
Woman,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Now that one of Shinra's greatest events is over, I guess it's back to the same old boring everyday life again..."
Woman,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,Is Gramps gonna stay like that even though rocket's gone?
Old Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"My, my precious rocket... It's gone.Hmph, I know. No matter how much I look, the rocket's still gone.But I just can't stop it. Just call it an old man's folly if you will.Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby.But, out of appreciation, let me give you this."
Old Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,I wish you'd take care of it and use it...Maybe it's time for me to get a new hobby...Mmm. You know that Shinra sports car at Cid's house? It might be fun to try and restore that thing...
Redhead,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"I get so restless now that the rocket's gone. And now that we can see Meteor clearly, ...I can't stand it."
Mechanic,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,I still can't believe that piece of crap rocket actually made it into space... I guess the mechanic was a genius.
Old Man,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"I got to learn more... Devotion, devotion."
Shera,Rocket Town - Huge Materia,"Now all we have to take care of is Meteor, right? You should be able...Excuse me... ...Please take care of the Captain."
Person,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,That's funny... did I drop the key to this gate... somewhere? Was it when I was on that excavation tour?
Boy,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,They're purty!
Girl,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,Hey! Where's the flower lady?
Person Outside the Pipe,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,These folks went wobbling off somewhere...They said something about the 'Reunion starting'... sounded almost like a chant. Wonder what the heck that meant.
Woman Walking Around,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,I'm not going to look up or down! From now on I'm just going to look straight ahead.Maybe not. I'm just flapping my gums. I really wonder how things will turn out.
Person in Blue,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,"What's going on with the world? When it's all said and done, we're all gonna wind up dead."
Man in Straw Hat,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,"Yeah, that's right! But, even so, where could we move to now...?"
Person in Blue,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,...You've been talking like that for sometime now.
Materia Shopkeeper,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,"And I just got together enough money to get out of this place...Now it doesn't matter where I go! Ho, ho, ho..."
Item Shopkeeper,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,...stare... ......hmph... we only trade items for gil here. No matter what.

Ester,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,Congratulations! You came in first!
Cloud,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,I lost...
Ester,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,"Oh, you forgot? It's all right. Ahem!First use the [Select] button to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on its own.But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.You can't really help on this one.But, most of the Chocobos that I'll provide you with are mellow and you should be able to handle them.When you're riding, use the [] Button to Speed Up and the X Button to Slow Down.But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose its stamina really fast.And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use the O Button to get a boost of speed.Of course your stamina runs out faster though.There are some bad tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast.For those kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on Manual and slow it down.Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,Push the [Start] button to end the race."
Zombie,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,"Welcome. No matter what happens in this world, The Ghost Hotel will always be in business.Uuuuuuuuuugh......For reservations, please step up to the counter.Uuuuuuuuuugh......"

With the way things are in the world, It makes you wonder what we're doin' here?Well, it's a little late for me to run around now, so I do what I love, it works best for me.Oh, by the way, did you know? I heard that there's going to be a battle and only the strongest will be allowed to participate.But what do they mean by 'strongest'? If ya ask me I'll say it's 'weapons.'But, there's gotta be a way to measure this too. Mmm, we need another way to measure strength."
Man Practicing Kicks,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,I'll give that Meteor my ultra kick...... ...or...... maybe not.
Registration Lady,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,"Those two over there eloped, saying stuff like 'OUr last moments together---' I can't bear it.I don't have anyone like that in my life so, if something happens, it happens....that's why I'm working now. Oh, sorry for going off like that..."
Registration Lady,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,"Um, I'm sorry, that's only for registered participants. You won't be able to go in through there until you come and register."
Registration Lady,The World - After the Rocket's Failure,"You know, I've been thinking about it for a while now, but you must be pretty strong?Probably strong enough to take on the top 1 or 2 fighters?Maybe you'll be good enough for the big match......How 'bout it?

Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Ho Ho Hoooo. If you ever are in need of my wisdom, you are always welcome here."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Yeah, that's why we came."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"What to do? Have you lost your way? When that happens we each have to take a good long look at ourselves.There's always something in the deepest reaches of our hearts.Something buried, or something forgotten.Remember it... Whatever that is, must certainly be what you are all looking for..."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"That's easy enough to say... But, I can't remember a thing."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,It must be there. Look harder!
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"This ain't no good with just us! Cloud, we gotta get some others in here."
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"...no good. Cloud, let's have the others come."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,nghh... no good. We alone cannot do it. We need to have the others here.
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,You expect me to know that? Let the others do it!
Cait Sith,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"How about it, Cloud? Shouldn't we have the others come?"
Vincent,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"I don't know, Cloud. I think we should have everyone here."
Cid,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Ahh, no good. Cloud you call the others in here too!"
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Do you see it? What is it that you are searching for?
Cait Sith,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Nope. Not a thing. Naw. Can't come up with a thing.
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Me either! I don't get any of this!
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"I remember Aeris a lot.No... not that.You haven't remembered.You haven't forgotten.That's not it...How would you say it... Aeris was right there all along. Right by our side.She was so close, we couldn't see her. What Aeris did... The words she left behind..."
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,That reminds me... I was the same.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,......as was I.
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Me too...
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,She said she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth's Meteor.
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,But Aeris is gone.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Is it impossible for us to carry on... what Aeris tried to accomplish?
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"We ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean."
Cid,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"What, did that girl go off to that place?"
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,That's it!!
Cid,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,What's it?
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,We don't know about it.What did Aeris know?Why did she face Sephiroth without running away?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"I see... She returned there once again, correct?"
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Hmmm. Perhaps I'll have you take me there.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,You're going too?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,What's so surprising about that...?Even I want to get out from time to time and see the outside world. I wonder what did it? I haven't felt like this in ages.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,It must be the planet. The planet is calling you!
Cid,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Yeah, hoo boy, the planet calling... right."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Ho Ho Hoooo. Then let's go.
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Oh yeah, Bugenhagen. I have one more thing I want to ask you.We're carrying around Huge Materia. This is pretty delicate stuff and we would like to keep it in a safe place..."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Ho Ho Hoooo. Then we'll put it upstairs. Now, shall we be on our way?I'll teach you how to work the machine. Watch carefully now. You just pull this here..."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Ho Ho Hoooo. Is this what you call Huge Materia...?This is really rare Materia, indeed.Materia this rare is certain to have a special consciousness enclosed in it."
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Huge Materia...It is glowing strangely...- Get closer...- Leave it alone- Go back down
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,This color... it's the same color as magic Materia.
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,This color... it's the same color as command Materia.
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,This color... it's the same color as summoned Materia.
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Is that... Bahamut...?
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Ho Ho Hoooo. Good. Now let's leave.Do you remember how to use the machine down below? If you ever want to see Materia, come here anytime."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Hm, hmm, hmm!.......Smells like machinery.I love this smell.Of course, I also love the smell of nature, too......Hm? Is the deck up there?Then I'll be on the deck just passing the time.I can feel the workings of the planet in the smell of the wind.I also feel the greatness of man's wisdom and the knowledge in the smell of machinery...Well, bye for now."
Yuffie,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Cloud...... urp...... ugh.You know, I was thinking...... phew...... Why does materia always have something to do with battles or magic?I bet the Ancients must've always been fighting.It must've been... ugh... terrible..."
Barret,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"And Aeris... she's dead.Guess she turned into spiritual energy and returned to the planet, huh?But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again..."
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,I wonder what Aeris felt... when she was on that altar...?
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,I'm sure she wanted to give her life for the planet...
Tifa,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Really? I wonder? I don't think that's it at all.I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she planned on coming back all along.She always used to talk about the 'Next time'.She talked about the future more than any of us...Although she never talked about it to us she must've had a rough life...I think Aeris looked forward to tomorrow and the future more than anyone......she must've had many many dreams......"
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Aeris used to pat me on the nose sometimes.I used to hate being treated like a child like that, but I also liked the attention.I wanted to apologize to her for what I did when we first met."
Cait Sith,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"I went an' told Aeris' Mom about her death.Yes, an' Miss Elmyra was cryin' herself silly... So was little Marlene..."
Vincent,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,City of the Ancients...The Ancients... after a long time that is probably what others will come to call us...Hmmm... hwa ha ha ha... It's only a matter of time for us.
Cid,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Aeris...?I wanted to give her a ride in the Highwind......
Learner Pilot (LV11),Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Okay then, let's go!"
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,- Let's go!- Wait a sec......
Elder Hargo,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"(in the observatory)I hope great Bugenhagen will take care and not overexert himself.'Ho Ho Hoooo.' I may be light, But I'm not as young as Nanaki.Oops. That will only get you angry. You're just like me. Ho ho ho."
Kid in Nanaki's Room,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,Both Nanaki and Mr. Bugenhagen are gone... I feel so lonely...
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris,"Sorry... I'm really sorry. But now, I have......"
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,This is...Yes...... exactly...
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Are you getting something?
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,...give me a moment.
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"The knowledge of the Ancients swirling around here is telling me one thing.The planet's in a crisis...A crisis beyond human power or endless time.It says, when the time comes, we must search for 'Holy'."
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Holy?
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Holy... the ultimate White Magic. Magic that might stand against Meteor. Perhaps our last hope to save the planet from Meteor.If a soul seeking Holy reaches the planet, it will appear.Ho Ho Hooo.Meteor, Weapon, everything will disappear.Perhaps, even ourselves."
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Even us!?
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,It is up to the planet to decide.What is best for the planet. What is bad for the planet.All that is bad will disappear. That is all.Ho Ho Hooo.I wonder which we humans are?
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Search for Holy... How do we do it?
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Speak to the planet.Get the White Materia... This will bond the Planet to humans.Then speak to the planet.If our wish reaches the planet, the White Materia will begin to glow a pale green."
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"...This is the end.Aeris had the White Materia...But when Aeris died, it fell from the altar...That's why...... this is the end."
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Ho Ho Hooo!Ho Ho Hooo!Ho Ho Hooo!Look at this!
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,!?
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Ancients' writing.
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Can you read it?
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,I can't even make it out!!
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,This's no time for jokes...
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"I'm not an Ancient. I can't read this thing!I may be old, but my eyes aren't completely bad yet. Look closely below the writing."
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,There's something written in chalk... ...... (even sunlight can't reach)...... (Key)
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,It was probably written by a scientist who's been here... He probably used all his energy to make out these two words.
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Key......? To what?
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"I don't know... But, it probably has something to do with our riddle.The riddle... then it must have something to do with Aeris."
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,So this note points to where the key is?
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Probably...Use these words as clues and go find the key.I'll continue to figure out the Ancients' writing.
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"A place (Even sunlight won't reach) is where the (key) is, right?"
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"When you find the key, or when you can't go any further, come back here.Maybe I'll understand more from the writing and get some new information for you."
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Remember, a place (even sunlight can't reach) is where the (key) is..."
Barret,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Whacha gonna do, Cloud? Got any good ideas?"
Tifa,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Cloud......
Nanaki,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"If I were more of an adult... Perhaps, I would have a better idea of what to do?Phew... I wish I could grow up.I wonder if I'll be an adult after all this is over?"
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Lately, they don't call me to no more meetin's. Reckon that's because y'all know I'm a spy."
Vincent,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"......feelings alone aren't enough. ...it's irritating, isn't it Cloud?"
Cid,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Phew...... Cloud. What're gonna do?
Yuffie,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Are you waiting for Cloud?He's flying right now, so you can't get him.Were you going to force me into the submarine right now?Quit it! If you want to go, then just leave me behind.............ooooooh. What're you talking about? I......"
Learner Pilot (L12),City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Cloud, let's go!"
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"- Okay! Let's go!- Uh, wait a sec!"
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"(even sunlight can't reach)... Hmm... if we're above ground, and sunlight reaches everywhere... Then it's probably not above ground..."
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"A place where sunlight doesn't reach... Right, it must be underwater!"
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Underwater? There's... no way... We need a submarine...Wait. Submarine... I think there's one at Junon Port......
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Do you think it's......?
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Key of the Ancients...
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Oh! You've found it!
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,What does it mean?
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,That Music Box over there. We'll put the key in it.I'll go use the key. You all wait here.And watch closely what happens.Ho Ho Hooo!
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Now, go inside. Hope may be inside... Or......"
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,This was just a screen to project an image!Look! Look at the image projected on the screen of the water!
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,...It's glowing.
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Ho Ho Hooo!! It's pale green!!
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"...Aeris. Aeris has already prayed for Holy....After I gave up the Black Materia to Sephiroth...... Aeris' words came into my dreams...She said, she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth...... And to do that, there was a secret here...That was Holy...... That's why, she had the White Materia. Aeris knew about here... and what she had to do.Aeris has left us great hope. But, it cost her her life... her future...I'm sorry... Aeris. I should have figured this out sooner....You left us without saying a word...... It was all so sudden, so I couldn't think...That's why it took so long for me to find out... But, Aeris... I understand now.Aeris... I'll do the rest."
Barret,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,That's 'WE'!
Tifa,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"You mean, WE..."
Nanaki,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,WE'LL take care of it.
Yuffie,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Not I, dorkus! WE!"
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,It's WE! Isn't it WE?
Vincent,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,I? ...you mean WE.
Cid,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,You &^$#%^! It's WE! WE!
Barret,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,The thing Aeris left for us... We gotta take care of it.
Tifa,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,What Aeris left us... We can't waste it.
Nanaki,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,What Aeris left for us... We can't let it go to waste.
Yuffie,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,The hope she left us... We've gotta take a chance with it!
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,What Aeris left us... We mustn't let go to waste...
Vincent,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,The hope an important person left for us... We must make it stronger...
Cid,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,The big gift the flower girl left for us... it'd be sad if we didn't finish it!
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Thank you... Aeris.Aeris' voice has already reached the Planet. Just look at the glow of the White Materia.But...... how about Holy? How come Holy isn't moving?Why?
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Something's getting in its way.
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,......Him......He's the only one that could do it....Sephiroth. Where are you?
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,H... Hey!
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,What the?
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,whisper... whisper... (sorry I was a little surprised).
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,What happened?
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"You remember when the Junon Cannon disappeared? Actually, Rufus moved it."
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Moved it? That big thing......? Where...? Why?
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Rufus wants to destroy Sephiroth with it.That cannon operates on Huge Materia. But the Huge Materia has already been used in the Rocket Plan.So since the cannon's useless right now, he decided to move it.To a place where Materia... no, where Mako is gathered..."
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"And, where is that!?"
Rufus,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"......That's why, Reeve. It's your job to adjust the reactor's output."
Reeve,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,I see......
Scarlet,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Hah, hah, hah! Don't worry about adjusting it, Reeve.Once you open it up all the way everything will go full speed!"
Heidegger,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Gya hah, hah, hah! The President's sure done it this time!If we can only defeat Sephiroth, the idea that Meteor will also disappear is based on different objectives!"
Scarlet,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Please remember, Mr. President...It was my idea to fire Mako reactor powered shells."
Rufus,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Will the shells really reach the far northern border?
Scarlet,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Ah, hah hah!Of course!But Mr. President, please do not call it a Mako cannon.This new weapon will be called......The Sister Ray!"
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"............?Wh, what the...!?"
Cid,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,What's wrong!?
Crew Member,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,It's a strange signal!
Cid,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,From where?
Crew Member,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,(turning towards Cait Sith)It's coming from this... person(?)
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Wow!Hey!That was a surprise, the controls went crazy.This ain't good...Weapon came out of the sea and is heading straight for Midgar."
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"The new weapon should stop him, right?"
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,I don't know if it's ready or not...
Barret,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Hey! What's gonna happen to Marlene!?
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Doncha worry none, Marlene's in a safe place. She's with Aeris' mama.Barret!!What was that scratching just now!?As long as Marlene is safe, who cares what else happens, right?I been itchin' to say this to ya fer a while now!When ya blew the Midgar No. 1 up, how many folks d'ya think died?"
Barret,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,...that was for the life of the planet. Ya gotta expect a few casualties.
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,A few? Whaddya mean 'a few'? What may be a few to y'all is everythin' to them who died......Protect the planet. Hah! Y'all sure sound good!Ain't no one that'd go against ya. So ya think ya can do whatever y'all want?
Barret,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,I don't wanna hear that from no one in Shinra...
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,......nuthin' I can do 'bout that...
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Stop it!
Tifa,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Cait Sith...... Barret, he knows what he did.What we did in Midgar can't be forgotten no matter what the reason."
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,OK! Let's go! We'll beat Weapon ourselves!
Cid,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Hey Cloud......You think we can win against that monster? We got a chance of winnin', right?"
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"How would I know?But that's no reason for us to just let him go!We're goin' to Midgar and fight Weapon! Come on, let's move!"
Barret,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,That damn Weapon... He's one big *&$*&%$...Even Midgar's gonna be in trouble.
Tifa,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Whether you love it or hate it...You just can't bring yourself to leave Midgar, can you?"
Nanaki,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Midgar...I hated the fact I was caught by Hojo and taken back to the lab where they did all kinds of experiments on me...But because of that I was able to meet you all...People you meet... others you don't...... strange isn't it?
Cait Sith,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Cloud, you do your best now, hear!?I know y'all can't forgive the Shinra, but them poor folks in Midgar ain't done a bit wrong!"
Vincent,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,......we still can't seem to get near Sephiroth...
Cid,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"That reminds me, there was a test rocket that landed in the Slums of Midgar long ago.I remember I was relieved when I heard it never blew up."
Bugenhagen,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"Traveling is wonderful, isn't it?......"
Learner Pilot (L13),City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,Cloud! I'm going!
Cloud,City of the Ancients - Aeris's Prayer,"- Okay- Excuse me, but could you wait?"
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Hey, HEY! What're ya tryin' to do? Break the Highwind? Let's fight on the ground!"
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Wassup, Mr. Monster? What're you lookin' at?"
Tifa,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,What's wrong? Are you still looking for something...?
Nanaki,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Something's wrong...
Yuffie,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Huh? It's looking somewhere else. Doesn't it want to fight us?
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,What's going on?
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Doesn't look like it's after us. Something else...
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,What's wrong? It's like you're blowing us off!
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"No, it's...... feeling something. ......Yeah, it senses murder."
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Let's go back to the Highwind!
Tifa,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Let's go to the Airship!
Nanaki,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Let's watch from the Airship!
Yuffie,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"OK, can we GO now!?"
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Let's go back to the Airship.
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,We should go back to the ship now.
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,To my ship!
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Oh no! We gotta get outta here!Something big... I'm talkin' REALLY BIG's comin'!
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Oh no! Let's hurry out of here!Something big... I'm talkin' REALLY BIG's comin'!
Heidegger,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Hah, hah, hah, Mr. President, preparations for Sister Ray are now in order."
Scarlet,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Hah, hah, hah!Anytime is fine."
Rufus,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,(laughing)......Fire.
Tifa,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Which direction is it going to attack from?
Nanaki,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Midgar!
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Marlene!!
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Damn...
Nanaki,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,It went right through Weapon......
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I see! They're after Sephiroth! The crater on the Northern boundary!
(operator),Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Sir! Weapon's been defeated!!The barrier has disappeared!
People Fleeing,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,WHOOA-- Weapon's attacking!Run for your lives!!
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,What happened to...... Sephiroth?Northern Cave...Let's go see what happened to it.
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"When AVALANCHE was jes startin', we used to put up flyers everywhere.And now, we're up against Sephiroth. How about that?Feels like a long time ago."
Tifa,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Now we're going to fight Sephiroth.I wonder what the inside of that cave looks like? You think Sephiroth is just sitting there waiting for Meteor?
Nanaki,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Will we save the world if we beat Sephiroth?I'm frightened, but I'll do my best. Let's hurry to the Northern Cave!"
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,......Wonder what that Sephiroth feller's up to?
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Defeat Sephiroth... Defeat the son of that beloved woman...Am I on the verge of committing another sin......?Or am I atoning as best I can for only watching...?
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Maybe this is the time?
Yuffie,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"What's the pilot like?Tell him  says if he pilots the plane smoothly, give him my autograph..."
Learner Pilot (L14),Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Hey, Cloud!!!"
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"- Y, yeah, let's go!- U, uh wait"
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Sephiroth's energy barrier is gone......Cid! Can the Airship get inside?
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Huh? He's my student, ain't he!? Of course he can go anywhere!"
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Right, sorry about that."
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Yo, Cait Sith! Now what?"
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Hold it!Scarlet! Heidegger! What's going on?
Heidegger,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Strange. I can't reach the President!
Reeve,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Not the President. To Sister Ray!
Scarlet,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Ha, ha, ha. What is it Reeve? You're speaking strangely."
Reeve,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,None of that matters!The reactor's output is increasing all by itself!
Scarlet,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Ww, wait a minute. That's not wise!It must cool for 3 hours or it won't work. Reeve, shut off the machine!"
Reeve,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,We can't do that! It's inoperable!
Reeve,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,What about the mainframe? Who!?
Heidegger,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Huh? Why are you giving orders?
Reeve,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I don't give a damn about the details!!
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Ha, ha, ha...... Just you wait, Sephiroth.I'll give you all the Mako you want."
Reeve,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Hojo, STOP! The cannon, no, Midgar itself is in danger!"
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Ha, ha, ha...... One or two Midgars? ...it's a small price to pay."
Reeve,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Hojo! HOJO......!!
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Show me...... Sephiroth.It should be near...Ha, ha, ha...... Go beyond the powers of science...Before your presence, science is powerless...I hate it, but I'll concede to it.Just... let me see it.Ha, ha, ha......"
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,YO! Do somethin'! Ya big cat!
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"We're sunk. Hojo's doing this on his own.........? ...? H, huh!?I don't like this......"
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"You're busted, Reeve!Too late tryin' to hide it now..."
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Can't you stop the Mako reactor?
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,......We can't stop it.
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible!?"
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,............
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,We came a long way to get here. You better not double-cross us now!
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I can't make you trust me......
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"You damn fool! Don't you understand anything I'm saying?I don't give a damn about Shinra. If you're a man... no, if you're a human being, you'll save the planet! Don't you even care?"
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"No way! If we shut down the reactor, all hell will break loose!!"
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Why? Can't you just shut off the valve?
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Yeah, it's easy to shut off the reactor's pipe valves......But the reactor made a path for the energy to escape from below.Once you open that, it'll be impossible to close it until everything blasts out...And we can't try to stop the energy from gushing out......"
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,An explosion!!
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,This blast'll be way stronger than when the number 1 reactor blew up!
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Damn...!
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Forget about that......... the CANNON! We've got to get to Midgar! That's the first thing!!
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Must stop Hojo... first.
Reeve,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Looks like Cloud and the others are on their way. Stay out of the way!
Heidegger,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Ghaa haah hah hah!Don't be so ludicrous! I don't recall you giving me any orders!The Peace Preservation will give their best effort to make the enemy retreat!Because of them, I...... I...!"
Reeve,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,That's a private matter......
Heidegger,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,The President is dead! Now I'm doing things my way!Ghaa haah hah hah!
Scarlet,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Ha, ha, ha.Heidegger! Now I'm going to use the new weapon!"
Reeve,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Hey! Wait!!Cloud, everybody! Sorry......But!!"
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"But!But you'll come, won't you!?"
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I know!
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Hey!I'm leaving the ship in your hands!
Pilot,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I'm heading for Midgar!
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Comin' and goin'... gettin' pushed around.But I got a debt to all them back in Midgar that I can't never repay...
Tifa,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,It's all right.You're here... Everyone's all togetherTogether... we can do anything. We've worked this hard already.
Nanaki,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I wonder why Hojo performed so many of these experiments?Why couldn't he content himself with quiet research?
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I can't 'pologize to y'all enough.If I was just a bit more o' a better feller Ain't none of this woulda happened...
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Hojo... what a queer fellow.Such utter lack of scientific talent... compared with the genius of Dr. Gast......Lucrecia chose him trying to protect him...Now I understand... I understand... but...
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,We're busy runnin' back and forth!Even my bikini goddess would be pantin' about now!
Yuffie,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Headed for... Midgar?Uh, a, anywhere's fine... I don't care. Just hurry up and land this thing."
Learner Pilot (LV14 Limit Break!),Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Yo, Cloud! Whacha gonna do?"
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,- Move it!- Wait
Pilot,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,We've reached Midgar!
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Even if we get there, Midgar's under martial law!There'll be no way we could slip into the slums."
Tifa,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Looks like all transportation from the slums is cut off......
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Hey, hey, whaddya think we have Highwind for?Where are we now!?"
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Huh? Where are we...?
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,If land's no go... We'll go by air!
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Okay then! We'll parachute into Midgar!!
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Here we go!!
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Heidegger is going after you all.That's why it's dangerous out there. Let's go underground!
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Sounds strange comin' from me...But it feels like home bein' back in Midgar.Kinda makes me sick...
Tifa,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,We sure got to know the Midgar underground.
Nanaki,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"I have an old score to settle with Hojo, so let's hurry and go!"
Yuffie,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,This place smells gross. Let's get this over with!
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"So it was Hojo who stirred up all this commotion, after all these years...?"
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Yeah! Let's get it over with!
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,This is where we go in.
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Leave this to me! Hurry to the cannon!
Nanaki,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I smell it! The cannon's not this way!
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Dead end!
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Oh no! They're here!
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,What are we going to do!? I think it's okay for you to ignore your orders now.
Reno,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"...Elena, don't act so weak."
Rude,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"We're Turks, Elena."
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"...Yes, sir. You're right."
Rude,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Come on, we've got work to do."
Reno,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"I'm not really up for it, but..."
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Our orders were to seek you out and......Kill.Our company may be in turmoil, but an order's an order.That's the will and spirit of the Turks! Believe it!"
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,......
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,What are you doing! Let's go!
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"- Okay, let's end this- No, let's not go"
Reno,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"I know we have a weird relationship, but...We have to end this... like Turks!"
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Try this on for size!Yeow! That hurts!Take THAT!!
Rude,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,............
Rude,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,(on defeat)Reno! Elena! Let's pull out!
Reno,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,(on defeat)Let's call it a day.
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,You showing pity!? Don't take the Turks for fools!
Reno,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Wait, Elena."
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Reno! You're not violating the order... are you!?
Reno,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Shinra's finished. It's come down to this.
Rude,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,......
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Rude...
Reno,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Elena, you were a great Turk!"
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,......
Reno,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Farewell. If we both survive...If we can save our lives...
Elena,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Remember the spirit of the Turks...!
Rude,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Our mission's finished...
Yuffie,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon---!"
Tifa,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I'm all right! Hurry and go to the cannon!
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Which way...!?Goddamn, piece of $#@^% cannon!!"
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"No, no! The Sister Ray's not this way!"

Nanaki,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,!?
Yuffie,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Are you serious...?
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,......!
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Hey-hey! You serious...?
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"No, no way...... I didn't know they completed it..."
Heidegger,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! Here they come!G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! So they really showed up!"
Heidegger,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,You sure did treat us like dogs up to now!!
Scarlet,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,You killed off a lot of my precious soldiers!
Heidegger,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! But let's see how you do against anti-Weapon artillery!"
Scarlet,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"You guys are worthless, but my proud creation is a sure thing!"
Scarlet,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I'll show you the destructive power of the Proud Clod!
Scarlet,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Not that! This is the proud Clod.........!?
Heidegger,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Whoooooa!!
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,We don't got any time! Please get on with it!
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"This way, Cloud!"
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"(on a lower platform, watching)Damn! Hojo...!"
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Hey! This is...
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"This is great. Hold on, Hojo......!"
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Hojo! Stop right there!!
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Oh... the failure.
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,At least remember my name! It's !
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Every time I see you, I...It pains me that I had so little scientific sense...I evaluated you as a failed project.But, you are the only one that succeeded as a Sephiroth-clone.Heh, heh, heh...... I'm even beginning to hate myself."
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,None of that matters... just stop this nonsense!
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"(pausing)...nonsense?Oh, this?"
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Why!? Why do that!?
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Quit asking me why, you moron.Hmm... actually, you might be cut out to be a scientist."
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,...your son?
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Ha, ha, ha... Although he doesn't know.Ha, ha, ha... HA, HA, HA...!!What will Sephiroth think when he finds out I'm his father?Always looking down on me like that.HA, HA, HA...!!"
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Sephiroth is your son!?
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,......!
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Ha, ha, ha...I offered the woman with my child to Professor Gast's Jenova Project.When Sephiroth was still in the womb, we took the cells of Jenova...HA, HA, HA!!"
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,You......!
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I can't believe you're the one who did this...The illusionary crime against Sephiroth...
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Heee, hee, hee, hee! No you're wrong!It's my desire as a scientist! Heee, hee, hee, hee!"
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"......I was...... wrong. The one that should have slept was......You, Hojo!"
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"I... was defeated by my desire to become a scientist.I lost the last time as well.I've injected Jenova's cells into my own body!Heee, hee, hee!Here are......Heee, hee, hee!...my results!!"
Hojo,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,"Gwah, haw, haw!!Haw... now let's seehow the Mako juice is reacting?"
Cloud,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,......
Barret,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Anyway... that's the end of the cannon...
Tifa,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I can't believe Sephiroth is Hojo's son...
Nanaki,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,The father...
Yuffie,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,How sad... for him...
Vincent,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,Hojo...rest in peace...
Cid,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,%$#&$*&^%^
Cait Sith,Midgar - Shinra's Collapse,I'm so glad you came.
Cait Sith,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Shinra's...... finished.
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Meteor's gonna fall in about......
Nanaki,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Seven more days. That's what Grandfather said.
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Nanaki......You want to see everyone in Cosmo Canyon again?
Nanaki,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,.........yes.
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"(turning to Barret)You want to see Marlene, right?"
Barret,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Don't ask me that.
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"We'll beat Sephiroth...Then, if we don't release the power of Holy in seven days......There won't be a planet left to protect.If we can't beat Sephiroth...It's as good as death for us.We'll just go a few days sooner than the rest who'll die from Meteor."
Barret,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Don't be thinkin' you're gonna lose before ya even fight!
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"No!What I meant was...What are we all fighting for? I want us all to understand that.Save the planet... for the future of the planet... Sure, that's all fine.But really, is that really how it is?For me, this is a personal feud.I want to beat Sephiroth. And settle my past.Saving the planet just happens to be part of that.I've been thinking.I think we all are fighting for ourselves.For ourselves... and that someone... something... whatever it is, that's important to us.That's what we're fighting for.That's why we keep up this battle for the planet."
Barret,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"You're right...It sounds cool sayin' it's to save the planet.But I was the one who blew up that Mako reactor......Lookin' back on it now, I can see that wasn't the right way to do things.I made a lot of friends and innocent bystanders suffer......At first, it was revenge against Shinra. For attackin' my town.But now......Yeah. I'm fightin' for Marlene.For Marlene... For Marlene's future...Yeah... I guess I want to save the planet for Marlene's sake..."
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Go and see her. Make sure you're right, and come back.All of you. Get off the ship and find out your reasons for yourselves.I want you to make sure. Then I want you to come back."
Cid,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Maybe ain't none of us'll come back.Meteor's gonna kill us all anyway. Let's just forget any useless struggling!
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"I know why I'm fighting.I'm fighting to save the planet, and that's that.But besides that, there's something personal too...A very personal memory that I have.What about you all?I want all of you to find that something within yourselves.If you don't find it, then that's okay too.You can't fight without a reason, right?So, I won't hold it against you if you don't come back."
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"What are you going to do, Tifa?"
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Did you forget?I'm... all alone. I don't have anywhere to go.
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Everyone's gone...
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Yeah, we don't have anywhere or anyone to go home to."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"You're right...But... I'm sure someday... they'll come back, don't you think?"
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Hmm... I wonder...?Everyone has an irreplaceable something they're holding on to...But this time, our opponent..."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Hmm... But that's all right, even if no one comes back.As long as I'm with you... As long as you're by my side... I won't give up even if I'm scared."
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,.........Tifa......
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"No matter how close we are... We were far apart... before this.But when we were in the Lifestream surrounded by all those screams of anguish, I thought I heard your voice......sniff... you probably don't remember this...But deep in my heart I heard you calling my name... Or at least I thought I did..."
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Yeah... At that time I heard you calling me.You were calling me back from the stream of consciousness in the Lifestream.After all, I promised. That if anything were to ever happen to you, I would come to help."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Cloud...? Do you think the stars can hear us?Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"I dunno... But...Whether they are or not, we still have to do what we can. And believe in ourselves...Someday we'll find the answer. Right, Tifa?That's what I learned from you when I was in the Lifestream."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Yeah...... that's right...
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Hey Tifa...... I...... There are a lot of things I wanted to talk to you about.But now that we're together like this, I don't know what I really wanted to say...I guess nothing's changed at all... Kind of makes you want to laugh..."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Cloud... Words aren't the only thing that tell people what you're thinking...
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,............
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,............It's almost dawn...
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"H, huh...?"
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Sorry. Did I wake you...? It's almost dawn, Tifa."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Umm... G, good morning... Cloud.Give me a little longer... Just a little bit longer..."
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Yeah... okay.This is probably the last time we'll have together......
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"I see......I think I've heard about it, too.At that time, it was Tifa's voice......"
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Cloud...? Do you think the stars can hear us?Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"I dunno... But...Whether they are or not, we still have to do what we can. And believe in ourselves...I'll find the answer someday. As long as I keep trying."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Yeah...... that's right...
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"We've got a big battle tomorrow, we'd better get some sleep..."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Umm. Yes, I guess you're right......"
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,............It's almost dawn...
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"H, huh...?"
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Morning, Tifa. It's almost dawn..."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Mmm...... Good morning, Cloud.Give me a little longer... Just a little big longer..."
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,............
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,.........
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,We'd better go.
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"But, I still...!?"
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"It's all right, Tifa. You said so yourself yesterday.At least we don't have to go on alone."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Yes... That's right!
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Okay! Let's go!
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"The airship is too big for just the two of us.Yeah, it's a little lonely without everyone."
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Don't worry. It'll be okay.I'll make a big enough ruckus for everyone.Besides, I'm the pilot.No more flying around casually like before.We won't have time to feel lonely."
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Huh!?
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,It's moving......
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Barret! Cid!
Barret,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"O, oh...... is that okay with you?"
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Nanaki!
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Why didn't you tell me!?
Nanaki,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"But, you know, Cid."
Cid,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Hey, Nanaki.If you butt in now, you never know what they'll say later......"
Tifa,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,......Were you listening?
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Vincent!
Vincent,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Why such a puzzled look?You don't want me to come?
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"No, it's just that you're always so cold. I thought you didn't care what was happening."
Vincent,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Cool?Hmm...... I guess that's just how I am, sorry."
Barret,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Well lookey-here. The Shinra Manager's come back.
Cait Sith,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Uh, excuse me but...I wanted to come with the main group, but I couldn't get away......So some people in Midgar took me in.I know I have a stuffed animal body, but I'll work really hard!"
Barret,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,I guess that's everyone.
Nanaki,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"No, Yuffie's missing."
Barret,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,She ain't gonna show up.'Least this time she didn't steal our materia. Guess we gotta be thankful for that.
Yuffie,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,How could you say that!?I came all the way here after being seasick as a dog!I didn't go through all that just to have you guys have the best parts all to yourselves!
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Welcome back, Yuffie."
Yuffie,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Gee, Cloud...... that's so nice of you to say that. ......You sick?Well, whatever. I'm gonna be in my reserved seat in the hall...... waiting...... upp! ......Urk!"
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Thanks everyone.
Barret,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"We didn't come back for your spikey headed ass!We came back for Marlene. Guess it's jes' my...... whatcha call, feelings or somethin'.I, uh I ain't got now words now......"
Nanaki,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"......Although she's not here, she left us a window of opportunity..."
Cid,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,We can't let it go like this.
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"......Aeris.She was smiling to the end.We have to do something, or that smile will just freeze like that.Let's all go together.Memories of Aeris......Although she should've returned to the planet by now, something stopped her and now she's stuck......We've got to let go of Aeris's memory."
Cid,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Has anyone here changed their mind?
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"I'm counting on you, Cid."
Cid,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Yeah, yeah......There are 2 levers here that've been buggin' me for a while now...Let me try them out.All right, so what should I do?You decide, Cloud."
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,This is our last battle.Our target is the North Cave. Our enemy is...... Sephiroth!So let's move out!
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"We're almost to the North Cave! We're on our way, Sephiroth!"
Cid,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Man, I'm going to stick it to him!"
Cloud,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"What is it, Cid?"
Cid,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,Errrrggh! Some incredible force! Losing... control......!
Cid,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Get the hell outta here, flunkies! Didn't I tell you all to go home!?"
Crew,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Yes, sir. This is our home!!"
Cid,The Highwind - What We're Fighting For,"Oh ma--......stop trying to act so cool.All right, you jokers! Hold me down with everything you got!!Geronimo!!"
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,
Elder Bugah,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Where is the Promised Land...? Maybe Bugenhagen knows.Isn't Nanaki starting to notice? The reason why Bugenhagen sent him away from the canyon...
Kid in Nanaki's Room,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,"He's finally come home, but Mr. Bugenhagen doesn't seem well...I want to hear Mr. Bugenhagen's talk with Nanaki like we used to do..."
Elder Hargo,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,"I think Bugenhagen has foreseen it.About the planet... About Nanaki... And, about himself...But, Bugenhagen would never say that. All he says is 'Ho Ho Hoooo'..."
Kid,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,What's wrong with Bugenhagen? Is he sick?
Woman,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,"No need to be sad, even if something should happen. Everything will return to the planet... Bugenhagen says so.Just the thought of something happening to Bugenhagen... worries me."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Ho Ho...... Hoooo. You......?It's been a while... since I've been out. I think I must have... tired myself out a bit.Ahh...... don't tell Nanaki. He'll only worry...
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Grandfather!!
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Grandfather!!
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,...Nanaki...? ...you're still...... here?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,"I can't leave you like this, grandfather...!It's the duty of my... Seto's son, to guard this canyon and her people..."
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,"...listen, Nanaki. I think you may already know.If you have any mission in life, it is not to defend this valley.Look at the withering mountain grass. Listen to the warble of the new born chocobo's.Look always to the eternal flow of time which is far greater than the span of a human life.It will teach you more, than staying here in the valley...What you will see will eventually become a part of life's dream.For my children...... And for your children......So please, Nanaki... Go with Cloud... And with your eyes... your ears..."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,.........
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,"Ho Ho...... Hoooo. Now, now. Don't look like that. I'm all right.It's a wide world and you must go out and see it... You may even find your life's mate. You never know."
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Grandfather......
Bugenhagen,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Oh yes... take this along. I think it will look good on you now.Ho Ho......
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Nanaki... Is Bugenhagen...?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,......Grandpa told me that he's going away again!
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Away...?
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,"It seems like he really liked that Airship.He told me he couldn't stay still and just zipped out of here!He even gave me a gift, look!"
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to give gifts AFTER you come back?Ha ha...... Grandpa sure is strange! Haa... ha ha...... ha......
Cloud,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Hmm... So maybe we'll run into him again somewhere.
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,"Yeah... maybe...Thanks, Cloud......"
Kid in Nanaki's Room,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,"Nanaki, is it true that Mr. Bugenhagen left on a journey? Then that means he's better, right? He IS going to come back soon, right?"
Nanaki,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,".........Don't worry. Grandpa will come back floating, saying 'Ho Ho Hoooo' again..."
Kid in Nanaki's Room,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,"Yea, that's right! 'Ho Ho Hoooo'!It's Ho Ho Hoooo! Ho Ho Hoooo!"
Gatekeeper,Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell,Bugenhagen is what keeps our hearts strong...
Cloud,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,I've heard this melody somewhere before. Managed to play well...
Tifa,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,I have the sheet music for that song.Huh? Wait a minute! There's something inside the music sheet.
Man,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,Hey! This is your food.
Zack,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,"Oh, here!!Put on this.It smells a little though don't complain.You look pretty good with that.Well......"
Zack,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,Yo! Old guy! We at Midgar yet?
Driver,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,Shaddap! You're lucky I even gave you a ride!
Zack,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,What're you gonna do once we get to Midgar?
Cloud,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,.........
Zack,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,"I know what I'm gonna do.I got a place I can crash for a while...No wait, the mother lives there, too..."
Cloud,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,.........
Zack,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,"Yep... gotta change my plans!Hmm......No matter what I do, I need some money first......Hey, wanna start a business? But what could we do?Hey, Cloud.Think there's anything I'd be good at?Hey old guy!What do you think I'd be good at?"
Driver,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,What're you yappin' about? You're still young ain't ya?Young folks should try everything!You gotta pay your dues while you're young.Go out and look for what you really want.
Zack,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,Try everything... That's easy for him to say...
Driver,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,Hey... didn't you even hear a word I said?
Zack,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,"Listen, I'm gonna become a mercenary and that's that.Boring stuff, dangerous stuff, anything for money.I'm gonna be rich!So, Cloud? What are YOU gonna do?"
Driver,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,"No, wait... you got it all wrong."
Cloud,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,u... uhhh......
Zack,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,Just kidding... I won't leave you hanging like that.
Shinra Soldier,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,What do you want to do with him?
Cloud,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,...Ah... ughhhh......
Commander,Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare,...Forget it. Just leave him.
Redhead,The World - Before the End,"Hey, listen to me! I heard the barrier protecting Sephiroth is gone!But with Rufus dead, the Shinra troops don't know what to do. Heidegger and Scarlet don't have what it takes to lead the troops......I really thought something was finally going to get done, but everything's the same... not a damn thing's changed!"
Old Man,The World - Before the End,"Ah, youth... You really believe that big meteor filling up the sky's going to fall here?If Shinra, Inc was our last hope, and they've been beaten by terrorists...... Are we all going to die?"
Woman,The World - Before the End,"Dear, can you believe it!? They say that Shinra's gone under!!This world is coming to an end all because those terrorists called AVALANCHE stuck their noses in the wrong place!"
Old Man,The World - Before the End,"If something ever happened to President Rufus, That'd be the end of Shinra, Inc...... and the rest of the world, too."
Man,The World - Before the End,The North Crater barrier's been demolished?So now's the time to defeat Sephiroth.
Barkeeper,The World - Before the End,They say the remaining members of AVALANCHE broke Shinra's resistance and destroyed the Mako cannon at Midgar.What's going to happen to the world...?
Person in Blue,The World - Before the End,"I heard the remaining members of AVALANCHE smashed the Shinra troops at Midgar.Lately, there's been a number of scary incidents. I hate it. Just hate it!"
Kalm Traveler,The World - Before the End,"OH! It's ""Guidebook""! Wanna trade it for this Underwater Materia?How about it?"
Cloud,The World - Before the End,- Trade- Don't trade
Kalm Traveler,The World - Before the End,"Ok then, it's a done deal!"
Kalm Traveler,The World - Before the End,"OH! It's ""Desert Rose""! Wanna trade it for that Chocobo over there?How about it?"
Cloud,The World - Before the End,- Trade
Kalm Traveler,The World - Before the End,"Ok then, it's a done deal!"
Kalm Traveler,The World - Before the End,OH! It's the Earth Harp! Wanna trade it for some Master Materia?I'm not bein' stingy either! I'll give you all three of 'em!How about it?
Cloud,The World - Before the End,- Trade
Kalm Traveler,The World - Before the End,"Ok then, it's a done deal!It's a 3-piece Master Materia set... and it's all yours!"
Kalm Traveler,The World - Before the End,"""[item]"" and ""[item]""... Will you guys look for them for me?Now if I can just get ""[item]"", I can start my journey..."
Kalm Traveler,The World - Before the End,I guess it's time to go on a journey for the souls of my departed friends......
Soldier on the Path to the Airport,The World - Before the End,"I finally got orders to join the Great Sephiroth Plan. I even get to go on the Gelnika too...But, I'm just gonna ignore them. I wanna live to see the end of the world.If I'm lucky... There'll be a good place for me in the New World."
Little Girl 1,The World - Before the End,"Once the barrier's gone, I can hear cries from beyond the mountain..."
Little Girl 2,The World - Before the End,A sad voice is getting louder every second!The mountain must be crying. Is it hurt?
Man in Thicket,The World - Before the End,A bright light hsattered the barrier at the crater! What in the world's goin' on!?
Barret,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Heh heh...... heh heh heh... Time's got a way of sneakin' up on ya, huh?I'm shakin' all over... Heh heh... I feel sick..."
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Hey, Cloud... Would you tell me 'It's all right'?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,- Say it cool- Say it normal- Don't say it
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"It's all right, Tifa."
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Now I feel like things are really going to be all right.Thanks, Cloud.I'm all right. I'm not going to chicken out at the last minute."
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,...It's all right.
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"You're right, things will be all right.I'm... all right... really... I'll fight my hardest..."
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,...I just can't say it that easy.
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,I'm sorry... I guess you're right.......Wow. I guess... I am a little scared. My knees are trembling.
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"I am , son of Seto... I am afraid of nothing...It's all right, all right. I'm , the son of brave Seto... I'm not afraid of Sephiroth..."
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"But I ain't gonna forget, no matter what happens.Not about this here trip, or them folks--none of it!"
Vincent,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Cloud...... take the ship to the Northern Cave.The time for flying is now past.Our battlefield is now beneath the earth...The gate to tomorrow is not the light of heaven, but the darkness of the depths of the earth......"
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,You ever see the play 'LOVELESS'?
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,- No- Yes
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Yeah, I figured someone like you wouldn't be much on plays."
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Yeah? Really? Well, that's fine.They've been doin' that play every summer since I was a kid.An' I remember seein' it just once...That was when I was in Midgar interviewing to be a pilot.I had some free time and thought I'd catch the play.Now, I'm no big fan of the theater or anything.But this thing put me to sleep, just like I thought it would.Finally during the last scene, the guy next to me woke me up tellin' me my snorin' was too loud.So about all I really remember of that play is the end...The sister of the lead asks her lover,Do you really have to leave?And the guy says,I promised. The people I love, are waiting.......I don't understand. Not at all. But...... please take care of yourself.Of course... I'll come back to you. Even if you don't promise to wait. I'll return knowing that you'll be here.I remember thinking when I heard those lines,*&%! What the hell's he talkin' about? But, you know... now I'm not so sure...I think I understand......"
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"When this job's done, I'm landing the ship... yeah, that's what I'll do."
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Cloud...... sign this.
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,What is it?
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"It's a contract that says when the war is over, all the materia will belong to me.It's all in there. Read it carefully and then sign it, all right?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Forget it, I'm not even gonna read it.Whenever I read, I get airsick."
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Oh yeah......?I'm the same way, so I can't say too much......Damn! My plan failed. Let's pick on Nanaki later to let off steam."
Full Fledged Pilot,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Cloud, what do you want to do?- Go on- Wait a minute"
Crew Member,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,I wonder what everyone's going to do when this fight's over?I wonder what's gonna happen to the Highwind...?
Crew Member,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Take care!
Crew Member,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Welcome! Everyone's waiting for you.
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Looks like we can only slide down.- Alright, let's go!- We'll get prepared first"
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,The road splits into two. We'll split into two groups.
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Which you gonna choose, Cloud?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,- Left- Right
Barret,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,All right. Then I'll go...
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Then I'm going...
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"All right, then I'll go..."
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,I'm going......
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Then I'll be heading...
Vincent,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Then, I will be going......"
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,All right! I'm headin'...
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Now don't any of you die on me.......Gotta get through to Sephiroth!
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,I'll destroy that Sephiroth before anyone gets to him!
Vincent,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,It's all over now. With this...
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Oh man... 'Materia Hunter ' sounds like the last chapter of 'Materia Forever.'
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"All life on this planet, indeed the very life of this planet is in our hands..."
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"I'm so happy to have met you all, really! ...sniff..."
Barret,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Well...... Looks like this is our last big job!
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Let's all go back alive, okay?"
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,This will be the end of it!
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,We'll leave this to [name].
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Another fork in the road...
Barret,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Cloud which way you gonna choose?
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Cloud which way should we go?
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Which way are we headed, Cloud?"
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Cloud, which way you goin'?"
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Cloud, what shall we do?"
Vincent,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"What now, Cloud...?"
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Which way you gonna go Cloud?
Barret,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"All right, I'm goin'..."
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Then I'll go...
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"All right, then I'm going..."
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,I'm goin'...
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Then, I'll be heading..."
Vincent,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"If so, I will be going..."
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,All right! I'm heading...
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Sephiroth's probably crapping his pants right about now...
Vincent,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Let's go...
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"If I knew THIS was gonna happen, I'd have bailed out sooner!"
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,We're not the only ones fighting.The planet's fighting too!
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,There's nothing to worry about. ALL of us are in this together!
Barret,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Ain't no way I'm gonna die until I stick this into that guy.
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"After this, we can go home. All of us..."
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Wait! Sephiroth...
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Where's [name] and the others...?
Barret,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Yo, we're a bit late?"
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Hey, were you thinking of leaving me?"
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Don't leave us, Cloud."
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"I finally got here, so I'm not leaving..."
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"You're so cruel, Cloud."
Vincent,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,You sure are hasty.
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"I can't let you guys go by yourselves, you'll make me worry."
Cloud,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,This is the center of the Planet...?
Barret,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Here, Cloud."
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Cloud, look."
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Cloud, I found this..."
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Hey, Cloud, I found this."
Vincent,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Hold on to this.
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Hey, Cloud, I found this on the way."
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,......... Wh... What?
Barret,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Oh yeah, Yuffie, didn't you find somethin'?"
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,By the way Yuffie didn't you find something?
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"By the way Yuffie, didn't you find something on the way?"
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"By the way, Yuffie, didn't you pick up something..."
Vincent,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Yuffie, just let Cloud have it."
Cid,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Yeah, Yuffie, didn't you pick up something on the way?"
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Oh, all right.Here, Cloud."
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"But I'm the one who found it, so you better give it back to me when you're done with it!"
Barret,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Awright, this's the last dance!"
Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,This is it.
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,We finally made it here.
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,It feels like we made it as far as we can.
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Well, shall we get goin'?"

Tifa,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,Is this like a practice run before the real thing?
Cait Sith,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Yeah, a major practice run..."
Yuffie,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Heh heh, I'm fine with that. (It's probably more fun than fighting Sephiroth down there.)"
Vincent,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,"Hmm, this might be fun to pass time."
Nanaki,Northern Crater - The Settling of Everything,They're coming! They're already on the floor next to us!
