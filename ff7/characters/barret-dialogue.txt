C'mon newcomer. Follow me.
The hell you all doin'!? I thought I told you never to move in a group!Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridge in front of it.
Ex-SOLDIER, huh? Don't trust ya!If you push the Directional button while pushing the [CANCEL] button to run. (earlier marked X)
Yo! This your first time in a reactor?
The planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it every day.
It's the life blood of this planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the blood out with these weird machines.
That's it! You're comin' with me from now on.
Little by little the reactors'll drain out all the life. And that'll be that.
The planet's dyin', Cloud!
When we blow this place, this ain't gonna be nothin' more than a hunka junk.Cloud, you set the bomb.
Jus' do it! I gotta watch to make sure you don't pull nothin'.
......What's wrong?
What's wrong, Cloud? Hurry it up!
Heads up, here they come!
.........
All right, now let's get out of here.Rendezvous at Sector 8 station! Split up and get on the train!
If it's about your money Save it 'til we're back at the hideout.
No way!!
The hell would I know!? Do I look like a mind reader?
You damn right, you're late!!Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene!
Shi't!Havin' everyone worried like that you don't give a damn 'bout no one but yourself!
Wha!?I'm takin' it outta your money, hot stuff!Wake up!We're movin' out! Follow me!
Stop actin' like a damn kid. Si'down an' shu'up!
Look... you can see the surface now. This city don't have no day or night.If that plate weren't there... we could see the sky.
Huh?Never expect ta hear that outta someone like you....you jes' full of surprises.The upper world... a city on a plate...It's 'cuz of that &^#$# 'pizza', that people underneath are sufferin'!And the city below is full of polluted air.On topa that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy.
Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe...'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets.
Yo!! Get over here, all'ya!!
Yo, Cloud! You lissen up!
This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now.The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that explosion!Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that!Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!
Yo, Cloud! Over here, now!
Heh heh...You wanna meet your little baby?
Hey! Don' act like you don't know what I mean!I'm tellin' you...
Heh! Jes calm down.Can't have people suspectin' us.
Ok! Go on ahead.You! Cloud!! Get off your slow-movin' ass!!
Huh? Where'd you get that flower?
Oh......Did you thank him?
Great!!Get in here, fools!! We're startin' the meetin'!!
Yo, Cloud! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya.Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?
You sound pretty sure.
Don't you go thinkin' you so bad jes cuz you was in SOLDIER.
Yeah, you're strong.Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are.But don't forget that your skinny ass's workin' for AVALANCHE now!Don't get no ideas 'bout hangin' on to Shinra.
Shucks!! ............money...
Tifa! Let him go!Looks like he still misses the Shinra!
Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER!A promise is a promise! Here!!
What......!?
Uh...... ugh...... (That money's for Marlene's schoolin'......)2000!
Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first.I'll fill you in on the train.Yo! Cloud!Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you!I, uh,...... I don't really know how to use Materia!I'll give you that Materia you found. Just teach me how to use it!
Shi......! What's this 'It wasn't that tough!' crap!I'm clueless......Well, you handle the Materia then!
So this is what makes them guys in SOLDIER so great, huh!?Ok. I'll ask Jessie again later. But you're in charge of the Materia!
YO!Looks like this ain't no private car!! So split up!!
You say sumthin'?I said, 'you say sumthin'!?Yo, look at that!! It got empty alluva sudden.What's goin' on?
You workin' for Shinra?
&$#%!! You lucky ^$#^$.!
Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm...
Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!Awright... I'll tell ya!Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security check point at the top plate.It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains.
We can't use our fake ID's anymore...
Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train.Got it!?
Yo, Mr. know-it-all, big time SOLDIER! You oughta know the area 'round the No. 5 Reactor, right!So let's hear YOUR explanation!
What's goin' on!!
^%#@%! Someone blew it...
Let's go! Keep it up!
Awright! We clear!?
All right!! We made it!Yo!! This way!!Let's go!! We're gonna dive outta here!!
Hey you two! There ain't no time for that!Yo!! Ain't no time to waste!!...do something!
A leader always stays till the end.Don't worry 'bout me, just go!Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt!It's only the beginnin' of the mission!
Later! You take care of the rest!
C'mon!! Hurry your slow ass up! That's it, huh?
We're gonna jump outta here!! Follow me!!
Oh man...... We were forced to get this far out.We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on.Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!
What? That's it!?
We'll jump from here!! Follow me, you 'spensive leech!!
Oh man...... We were forced to get this far out.We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on.Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!
The hell!? So this is as far as we go...?
We're gonna jump off here!! Follow me!!
That was close. I thought we were gonna get caught...They probably don't realize that we've sneaked in yet. We should get to the reactor in no time.Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!
Good, so far everything's going as planned.Better not let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 reactor.Biggs, Wedge and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it.Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!
That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that to get under the Plate? No way!Yo, Cloud, what're we gonna do?
Don't be wastin' time. Never know when the Shinra'll find us.Cloud you jes' gotta go.
But, damn man, that thing gives me the chills.
Whaddya mean we're not goin' in? There ain't no other way of gettin' to the Sector 5 reactor 'cept through here.
Damn man, get a hold of yourself!
Damn straight.Tifa's old friend... That ain't good enough.
This way!
Presi... President Shinra?
AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! And you're President Shinra, huh?
Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place's goin' up with a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!
VERMIN!? That's all you can say... VERMIN!Y'all Shinra're the VERMIN, killing the planet! And that makes you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!
Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!
The hell is this!?
Yo, Cloud! We've gotta do somethin' 'bout him!
I don't care what it is!! I'm gonna bust him up!
It's gonna blow! Let's go, Tifa!
Not a damn thing.
Hey, you gonna be awright?
...Alright. Sorry 'bout all this.
Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for ya. Ya gotta do it yourself.
Alright, then, later.
Tifa! Cloud! You came!Be careful! They're attacking from the helicopter.
DAMN! It's a time bomb!
Shut yer hole!
Yo, we can use this wire to get out!
Marlene! MARLENE!!MAR---LE---NE!!Biggs!Wedge!!Jessie!!Goddamn it!!!Dammit!DAMMIT ALL TO HELL!!!!What the hell's it all for!?ARGGHHHH!!!
ARGGHHHH!!!
URGHHHH!!!
Marlene...
......huh?
R, really!?
Biggs...... Wedge... Jessie......
Think I don't know that?But... we, all of us fought together.I don't wanna think of them as dead!
This is all screwed up!They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed so many people...
No, Tifa!That ain't it! Hell no!!It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but the Shinra!
They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to...build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold!If we don't get rid of them, they're gonna kill this planet!Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!!
What don't you know!? You don't believe me?
An' what about you?
Yo!Where's he think he's goin'?
Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?
Damn! Marlene!!
Tifa. There ain't no turnin' back now.
Take me to Marlene!
Pull it together, man!
...What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?
Returned to the planet?
Marlene!! Aeris was caught because of Marlene!?I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm... really... sorry...
...please don't start with that. I think about it all the time. What would happen to Marlene, if I...But you gotta understand somethin'... ...I don't got an answer. I wanna be with Marlene... But I gotta fight.'Cause if I don't... the planet's gonna die.So I'm gonna keep fightin'!But, I'm worried 'bout Marlene. I really just wanna be with her... always.See? I'm goin' in circles, now.
I'm so glad...... I'm so glad you're all right...
Cloud!You gonna go help Aeris, right? She's done so much for me...If it's the Shinra you're dealin' with, I can't just sit here! I'm comin', too!
Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?
This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else.
There ain't no train that goes up there anymore...
Awright! We'll climb this wire!
There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?
Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.
Hey, you oughta know this building well.
I heard about this place before.Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to even for employees.Must be where they took Aeris.The security's pretty light now. Awright, let's go!!
Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and......
Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, Aeris'll...
That's more like it! C'mon, let's go!!
Don't need no appointment... This is a 'mergency!Anyone who don't wanna get their face bashed in better git outta the way!!
Let's go to the top!
Don't want no money. AVALANCHE ain't no packa criminals.We jes want back what your boss stole from us.
Now we ain't gonna hurt you. Might even pay ya, if ya help us.
Heh, heh, heh.
So there are times when even you fight for other people. I am impressed.
Y'know, I ain't so good at sayin' this, but... Sorry... for lotsa things.
Wh, what the!?
DA-MN...!I don't care where, Cloud! Just stop it!
Yo! You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?
Talk about out of the way...
Y, yo, Tifa! Don't go off by yourself...
Don't know... Why... the hell... We gotta... climb...
...heh heh heh.
So even you will fight for someone else. I had you figured wrong I guess.
I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong...
...how much farther do these stairs go on?
It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', d'ya think?
Right... couldn't be that...Are we there yet?
...there yet?
Yo...
Damn, man! I've had it! I'm going back!
............
Yeah, well all I know is I'm just flesh 'n' blood... 'cept for this arm of mine.Don't treat me like I'm some ex-member of SOLDIER or somethin'......
What're ya ignorant? I didn't mean that...
Yo... What floor is this?
Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?That Shinra... They're just no damn good.
huff... Man, I'm beat...Marlene, Daddy wanted to see your face one more time...
F...finally... M... made it...N... never wanna see... no more stairs the rest of my life...
Hey Cloud!You come all this way, you thinkin' of goin' back down to the 1st floor?
We ain't got no time for that! Stop messin' around, boy!
Yeah, that's right! Let's go on then!
This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down.
Lookit that, all them guards is runnin' around.Cloud, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to come.When those guards turn around, MOVE!
What the hell're ya doin'? Come on gotta do it again!
I shoulda known it'd turn out like this...If I'd known it'd be like this in the first place...
Ok! We gonna rock!
Hell, I know that!
Geez--! That's a lotta suits!
That dirty #$*$^
I dunno.
I remember him.That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science Department. Cloud, don't you know him?
See what?
Where's its $#&*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep goin'.
Shoulda noticed it earlier, you...
You're gonna pay!
Awright!! Step back!
What are you?
Now we've saved Aeris, ain't no need to be in this buildin'! So let's get the hell outta here!
Later! Meet up at the 66th Floor Elevator!
Where you goin'? Everyone's waitin' at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Then there's gotta be Mako!
@$#*^%! Quit dreamin'!
Hold it! I got a lot I wanna say to you!
Hey!Aeris is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is Cetra.The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is searching for that Promised Land.I only heard stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it really exists.Is that right?The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako energy.Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the Mako energy....and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker.I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin' new members!!Me, Tifa, Cloud... and Aeris too.
You're so damn boring.
Grandpa!? Ha, ha, ha...... Grandpa, hmm...... ha, ha, ha......
Nothin'...... ha, ha
How'd you get in? Why's the door open!?
The hell's goin' on'!?
I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get caught by Shinra!
He's dead... The leader of Shinra, Inc. is dead...
Who cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra now!
So he's a good guy then?
Rufus! &*%$! I forgot about him!
Vice President Rufus. The President's son.I heard that he's been assigned somewhere else for a long time...
I'm from AVALANCHE!
You only President, 'cause yer old man died!
What?
The hell's that supposed to mean?
Awright, Cloud!
I'll go on ahead!
Yeah, well that ain't happenin'.You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to watch out for you!Ok, playtime's over for you jackasses...
Who you callin' Mr. ? That don't sound right!
Huh? Oh, oh yeah... You a cold man. Just like someone else 'round here I know.
Notta thing. So what're we gonna do?
Tifa! Where's Cloud?
Huh? What's up? Where's Cloud?
Well, what do we do now?
And that'll save the Planet?
Awright, I'm going!
We told Aeris's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be safe too.
We need a group leader for our journey. 'Course only me could be the leader.
^#$^%...... awright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If something happens, we'll meet up there.'Sides, we can't have 5 people strolling down the fields. It's too dangerous. Split us into 2 parties...
...Thought you'd do that.Later, at Kalm!
Hey Cloud. If we keep going, we'll never get to Kalm.
Yo, wassup? Can't SOLDIER-man even lead the way?
This is Kalm.
Yo, I'll be waitin' at the inn... Hurry up and get your butt over there!
Get over here!
Yo man, you're late!
So let's hear your story......You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the planet.Let's hear it all.
You call that a friend?
You wait a minute!!Isn't that, um...?The name of Sephiroth's mother...I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the Shinra building.
Tifa, I was only......
Now you're pissin' me off!! This don't matter, so get on with it!
Yo wait, I wanna hear.
Tell us more!You saw your family, right?
Well I ain't gonna force ya...
Damn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!
(Why you talkin' to me!?)
Yeah, mebbe so. Wanna take a breather here?
......I get it.
Wait a damn minute! Ain't there more?
Damn! Don't none of this make sense!I'm going, going, going, gone!And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!Yo, Cloud! Let's get a move on!
Cloud, what's wrong? You just gonna stand there while Sephiroth heads for the Promised Land?I ain't lettin' Sephiroth or Shinra get to no Promised Land. If they do, then we're all screwed.Y'know what I'm sayin'!
Y'all jes leave it to me!
Fine! That's good enough.
Yo, c'mon let's go!
Yo, Cloud. Here.
Awright then, we're outta here.
This Sephiroth guy's pretty strong, I'd say.
Wh, who are you!?
Wassup with that broad?
Hey, we been had! And... my money!
Shit!! Gimme back my money!!
Hey, we been had! And... my money!
Shit!! Gimme back my money!!
Gone... Wassup with that?
Hey, we been had! And... my money!
Shit!! Gimme back my money!!
Gone... Wassup with that?
Hey, we been had! And... my money!
Shit!! Gimme back my money!!
Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?
The hell you talkin' about!? They're all fightin' the Shinra too! You gonna ignore that!?
Huh? Something's up there?
Damn, that's one big bird! But why are they trying to get rid of it with weapons?
I'll do it! I'll protect them from Shinra!
What's there to think about? We gotta do it!
Hey! We'll come to the rescue.
What are you thinking!? And you call yourself a human!?
Hey! We'll come to the rescue.
Ey, let's get some rest.
No! You got it all wrong! We're fighting against the Shinra!
Hey! Look at that!
C'mon Cloud.
I'm gonna relax for a while.
Seems like something's goin' on up there!
What's that music? It sure sounds lively.
Rufus!? I gotta pay my respects.
We gotta get to the town up there... Mebbe we could climb the tower?
Yeah, I'd like to take a good look at the new President of Shinra, Inc.!
Now ain't that something! I ain't never seen no Dolphin jump like that!
Good luck Cloud! If you make it, we'll follow you!Whoa, I'll hold the PHS for you. It'll break if it gets wet.
Look, Cloud. It's Rufus and Heidegger.They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em...Ummmm...... Gmmmmm......How can he...... Goin' off laughin' like that?Because of him, Biggs...... Wedge...... Jessie......!Ggggggggh... Ggggh......! Ggggggghhh!!God!! I can't take it anymore!I'm gonna settle things here and now......
Damn, did they find us!?Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean... Tifa and the others!?Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud!
You all right!?
Hey, wait.You don't think that suspicious character is...
How the hell am I supposed to know!?
I'm goin' too!
Look, Cloud!!
Isn't he...... that guy?
Jenova...You mean he's been walkin' around with that thing?
He said the time is now.
I don't know WHAT the hell's goin' on!Cloud, why don't you explain to me what's happened so far?
Whoa! We'd best hurry and hide somewhere.
Damn! Sure is hot here!But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this sailor suit.Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!
......What'ya mean "cute"?
The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be the most comfortable, so shu'up!
Hmmph, Cloud. You're the one, who's always hangin' around wastin' time. I'm going to skip this resort!
I'll wander wherever I damn well want! Who made him the leader?
Uh uh!Hmmm!?Marlene! You ok?......Dad'll wear this when I go to see you.Uh uh!Hey, yo!!! Someone's in here, awright!?
Yo, Cloud! Still too early, ain't it?
Yo, yo! It's a bad idea to kill him.
............ahh.
......whew!
Haaeyy!
Haeey!! Baaeby!!
Haeey!! Baaeby!!
Wait here...
...I'm sorry...
You heard 'em... It's my fault this town was... destroyed...
Sorry.
My hometown used to be around here.
It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried... in just 4 years.
An' it's my fault. ALL my fault.
(narrating)...My hometown, Corel's always been a coal mining town.It's so dusty, but calm and so poor...... a real small town, this one.That's the first time I ever heard the word "Mako Reactor" mentioned since that time...
But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of the times.
Listen, Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore.
(narrating)That's how the Corel Reactor was built..... and completed.We all thought it would bring us an easier life.
(narrating)It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days.Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops.All the townspeople... All my relatives...... Everyone... everything......
There was an explosion at a reactor.Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a rebel faction.
Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't forgive myself.Never should've gone along with the building of the reactor...
That's why... that's why I get so pissed off!!Not only did they take advantage of me...... But I lost my wife, Myrna, too...
Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...
Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...
It's all my fault...
......I ain't in no cheery mood. So jes' leave me alone.
So PLAY! ...messin' round #@^%$!Don't forget we're after Sephiroth!
Stay back! This's something I gotta deal with.Jes' leave me alone...
Didn't I tell you not to come here!?
Didn't want none of ya to get involved...
You guys...
There's another... another man that got a gun grafted inta one of his arms. It was four years ago...
(narrating)I remember... I was on my way home from visiting a Mako Reactor being built.
What!!!?
What the hell happened?......
Hmp!! Old man!!
Krggh!!
Shu'up!!
Dyne!! Hang on!!Lissen to me!! You're comin' back to the village, hear!!?
From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more....I was depressed for a while.But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted in.Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took everything away...Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got the same operation as me.But, his was the left arm.
...wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can rest in peace.An' that's why, I gotta go alone.
Shit! Tifa, you oughtta know by now.
...Dyne ...Is that you?
I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday...I knew you were alive somewhere... we had the same operation.Listen to me Dyne. I want to...
......?
...I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me.But... What're you doin' in a place like this?Why ya wanna kill those that ain't even involved? Why?
......
Dyne, Marlene...... Marlene's still alive.
I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure.That is why I wanted to be by her side till the end.That's when I found her... ...found Marlene.
She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?
What!?
Dyne... are you insane!?
Stop, Dyne! I can't die yet!
Stop it! I don't wanna fight you!
Cloud, you stay the hell out of it! This is MY problem!!
Dyne... I don't know either, man.Is this the only way... we can resolve this?
An' what 'bout Marlene? What's gonna happen to her!?
......
All right...
Dyne...?Dyne!
Dy------ne!!
I want to go up.
Dyne's got his reasons an' can't speak.
I want to go up.
The hell do YOU know!!
Say what!?
Awright then.Cloud, you go.We'll wait down here.Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here!
I don't like it. How'd they find out where we were?
A spy, maybe? No, no way.
I finally made it... So this is... Cosmo Canyon!
Wooooooooo!I always wanted to come here!
Good timin'. Let's take a breather.I got stuff I want to find out, too.
There was this guy who studied 'Planetary Life' here.He couldn't take things the way they were, so he went to Midgar to form AVALANCHE.Wanna hear more?
(on choosing "Go on")Guess you could say this is where AVALANCHE was born.I always wanted to come here... And... I finally...... made it.A lot... happened...
(on choosing "And then?")And then...? I don't know what's going to happen, now that there is no AVALANCHE...
What?
This is really somethin'!
Whoa! Shootin' stars!
This's really somethin'!
Cosmo Canyon... This's where AVALANCHE was born...I promised my guys someday... when we saved the planet from the Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate...Biggs... Wedge... Jessie...Now they're all gone... died for the planet....Really? To save the planet?We all... we all hate the Shinra...Do I even got a to go on?Will they......... will they ever forgive me?...Right now, I really don't know. But I know one thing.If there's anything I can do, to save the planet... or the people livin' on it... Then I'm gonna do it!I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I don't care...... let 'em decide for 'emselves.
...Where're they going?
They said they finished fixin' the buggy.
That's just the way it goes. ...You came in handy at times...
The hell's goin' on!? This a dream or somethin'?
You said the whole town burnt down, right?
You trin' to fool us!?
I woke ya up. Ya outta be thankin' me.
Hey! You lyin' white-faced!
That why you started sleepin' in a box? Gimme a break!
W, what?
The Shinra always keep the most useful things to themselves. Let's steal it!
I'm , of AVALANCHE.
...damn, man. Wassup with that guy's attitude?
He always like this? That's pretty bad!
It won't stop!
I don't care.
What!? The hell happened, all of a sudden!?
...Hah, I know what you're thinkin'. And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!?
The Shinra!!
Yuffie, so you're...!
Whaddya mean 'this one'!? 'This one'!So you WERE plannin' somethin'!!
The hell's goin' on!?I knew somethin' was missing. All my materia's gone!!
Hey, we gotta problem! Our materia's all gone!!
Yo... where's that $#@^% Yuffie...?
That &*&$ kid!!!Grrrrrgh!! Arrrrrgh Uhhhhhhhhhhhh!!She was after our materia from the start!!She went North! When I get my hand on her, I'll get our materia back!C'mon! We're goin' after her!
Wait, that damn Yuffie's still gotta be somewhere in this cheap town! Or you all jes' gonna go on?
Ain't nuthin' we can do about it...
Wh...what the hell is this!?
Y, yo, wait up!!
You damn Midgar hyena...!
Damn dirty-playin' $#%@&T$*^%$!
Never thought you'd come an' help us...
Jes' don't do nothin' funny to our Materia...!
Dyne......
I'm gonna bust the place up!
I been here since the beginnin', an' I still don't know what the hell's goin' on either.Cloud, the hell's goin' on? C'mon, tell us!
Cetra? That some kinda disease?
Yeah, me too! It's all just too damn confusin'.
Now all we gotta do is take action! We're startin' tomorrow!!
Yo, Cloud. You still up?
Uh, I was jes thinkin' of goin' for a walk...
What's wrong with that!? Don't gimme no lip!! I say we go!
Cloud, wanna take a peek?
Let's go somewhere where we can talk, in private.
Hey! You mean just the two of us are gettin' on...? ...yeah, I guess that's cool.
Hey foo. What you wanna see fireworks with me for?
You should've asked one or the other!
Oh man, there just ain't no choice!Tifa, Aeris.Ah, Yuffie?
What the hell's that supposed to mean?Hey, you don't mean... Marlene?NO WAY! Forget it!There ain't no way I'm lettin' a wacko like you anywhere near my little Marlene!She's my baby. My prized possession.......Marlene.Wish I could've brought Marlene here. She'd love the fireworks.Why the hell do I gotta be here with a foo like you...Shit... the more I think 'bout it the madder I get!Damn fireworks anyways.
Oh man I'm beat. Let's head back.
...it's Cait Sith. What's he doin' so quietly?
What're ya doin'? We're goin' after Cait Sith!
The hell you doin'!? We gotta go after Cait Sith!
The hell're you doin'!? We're goin' after Cait Sith!
Whacha doin!? We're goin' after Cait Sith!
What the hell are you doing!? We gotta go after that damn cat!
What the hell are you doing! Let's get Cait Sith!
Ya dirty &*$*%$!
The hell are ya!? What's your real name!?
Hmph! You ain't foolin' us this time!
Ma......Marlene!?
Sorry, Cloud.
Yo! I'm goin' too, Cloud! Gotta keep movin'!!
It says number 9. He has a tattoo on his neck.
Damn--! So this is the Temple of the Ancients!Oh man, you gotta be kiddin'. This is makin' me dizzy!
Yeah, I saw it.
You mean WE are, right?
Feels like a battle!
Hey!! Cloud!!
Is it some sort of a disaster?It looks like something's gonna fall from the sky.
Then just leave it.If we can't take it, then neither can Sephiroth, right?
Hey! I'll keep watch here!
Urrggggggh!!!! Cloud!!
HEY! Cloud, you #$#&@!
You look like you was havin' a nightmare.How are you feeling?
That's good. Man, I didn't know what was gonna happen.
Oh... Better keep it to yourself.
I guess that's right. Well, don't worry too much about it.
Everyone's out looking for Aeris.
By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?Hey, we're goin' too.
Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?
Yeah, godammit! It's 'cuz of you that Sephiroth got the Black Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!
I know you got problems... hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself.But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line.
Just a damn jackass, that's what you are...Yo, jes' think about it... How many people in this world do ya think really understand themselves?People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up.But, they go on living. They don't run away... Isn't that how it is?
Wait a minute, Tifa. Give him a little time.He has to decide this on his own.You believe in Cloud... right?
Hey, how are you?I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?Either way, you stay around here and about all you can do is worry about it.Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth... If it happens, it happens.I'll go upside your spikey white head and bring you back to normal!
If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it.
Hey yo! Wait up.That way goes to the Mountains up north. Let's hurry and find Aeris.
heh, there's a bed.
Yo, Cloud. Let's take a break here.
Cloud, what is it?
Wh, what! Sephiroth!?
How do you know that?
Then, we better get up offa our lazy asses!!
Stop it!!
What're ya tryin' to say?
...I dunno, man...
Which way'd that damn foo' Sephiroth go?
Hey, you awright?
Of course.
Hey, what's that!? They just gave you something, right? Let's use the [] button to find out.
You know, I've been thinkin'...?
...Seein' a place like this, makes you realize how awesome nature is.But, if anyone ever told me to live here, I'd tell them to... you know...I'll tell you one thing though, If I did have to live here I'd change things around 'n' make it better.I guess the total opposite of this would be...... Midgar.When you think of it that way, Shinra don't seem so bad...Uuuuuuurrrrrgh!!What the hell am I sayin'!? The Shinra, not bad!?
Y'know... standing here like this...Kinda makes you feel like the Planet's not on our side, don't it?Of course we can't even compete. I mean... The Planet don't even notice us humans...
So all this energy's gathered here for the planet to heal itself?
The rest is up to you!
He got away?
Damn, man! ...Pressure's on now.
Sephiroth...... What a damn crazy #*&^%.
I'll take care of the Black Materia. No matter what happens, I'll be right here.
Why Nibelheim!? Are you high on Mako or something?
That ain't Cloud... The hell is he?
How the hell're we gonna get outta here?
This is bad... Just like Corel.
Hey, you awright!?Damn! This was an illusion.
Are Cloud and the others awright?But what's up with that? One little piece of materia, destroying the planet...
What the......?The hell was that?H, huh!?Hey... Guys!Where are we? Where did we end up?
Tifa!!Something's weird here! It got pitch black all of a sudden, and everyone disappeared!
Yea... yeah!I don't know what's goin' on, but let's just get on with it.
Hey! We're here to help you!
It's safe. I have it.
You alright?
Okay then, here. Had a lot of pressure holding this thing.
Yo! Cloud! Stop! Knock it off!
Don't worry. I don't know what happened to Cloud either.Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry...None of them know if he's all right either.
Lessee now...... Must've been about 7 days.
You ain't over it yet. Remember that huge light, in the Northern Cave?Since then, the crater's been surrounded by a huge barrier of light.Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in that big hole, protected by the barrier.We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he wakes up.An' on topa that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on a rampage.
Remember that huge monster that was with Sephiroth, at the bottom of the crater?Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from the past.
Dunno. But he's up here goin' around tearin' shit up.Right now Rufus' fightin' it. I hate to say it, but he's got guts.We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but we ain't got no time...
...Dunno.
Execution!?What're ya gonna get by executin' us?
I take back what little praise I had for this damn jackass!
The hell are these people?
If you've gotta do it... do me first!
Huh!? Sleeping gas?
Why you......? Ain't you part of Shinra?
It won't open!
Hold your breath! Hold on as long as you can!
Shi-!
The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room!
Tifa! I'll help you, I promise!
No! They locked this too!
Goddammit......!!
Why the airport? An' leave Tifa there?
Shu'up!! I'm in a hurry!
The hell you doin' here!?
Damn, man!
Yo! You sure this is the right way? It's a dead end!
You damn cat......! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all be comin' soon!Yo, better watch my back till the end... partner!
You okay?
Dammit! Why didn't ya tell me you could fly an airship!?I thought...... Tifa was gone for good.
What's that sad face for?
Get a hold of yourself Tifa! C'mon, let's think about this!No way we can get offa this train we're on!
Tifa! When'd you become such a wimp!
What? Does Cloud always gotta be around?.......We did fine without him in the beginning......Right? An' what happened to tough girl I used to know? Where'd she go to?
Whenever I think of Cloud, everything gets all jumbled up.No matter how powerful Shinra or Hojo is, I can't believe they can create humans.But because of them, we know that Meteor is heading towards us......Y'know, even if I saw him, I don't have a damn idea what I'd do......
You sure!?
Uh......!? Yo, Tifa!!
That's bad......
......
So what about him? You know...... Cloud?
No wonder...... After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed up here......
......hope......Hey, but honestly, man...... Do I really want him to come back?What did he do for the world? What can he do for us from here on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow......
No, nothin'. Nothin' at all, doc.
You okay?
Yeah, that's probably best......For Cloud...... an' for you......
Why you apologizin'? We'll come back again an' check on ya.
You take care now, Tifa. And take care of Cloud.
Oh, and uh, Tifa... I don't like askin' this but......Is he really your childhood friend? And not Sephiroth's shadow?
Yeah......? Okay then...... Sorry for askin' that.
We gotta get back to the Highwind.
What're we gonna do now! What can WE do?Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do?An' don' go tellin' us to wait for Cloud to get better.
Yeah, what!? That you a spy?
Corel!What else can they do to Corel!?
Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!Besides, when Cloud gets back, I wanna show him this Huge Materia. He's gonna be shocked.
I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. You just... shut your face!Every group's gotta have a leader.An' that's me!Or at least I wanna be... But I ain't cut out to be no leader.I never knew that till lately.An' that's what is......
You been chosen to be the new leader.
But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you.We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You!That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can.
Awright, now here's the first job.The Operation Room's waiting for you!
Yo, Cid!When you're ready, we're headin' for the Corel Reactor. C'mon Mr. leader, you'd better hurry.
Yo, Mr. Leader! Get your pilot ass up here!
Da---mn!
NO! You damn boneheads!
How can they even drive this?
What!?
Can't keep regrettin' the past... It's the future we gotta think about now.
Got no time for that now!
Hey, it's not working!
Hey... HEY HEY!!
Of... of course! We're all born and raised in the coal mines!!No matter how tough it gets, our hearts burn bright red like coal!
I did it again... I can't keep up with this.
We'll get there first!
Cloud...
Huh? Mr. Leader, what's next!?
Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?
Huh? Something's up there?
Hey! We'll come to the rescue.
Man, we're walking on dangerous ground. We can't lose now!
Damn man, it's Huge Materia.
We gotta get there first and beat 'em no matter what!
You mus' mean Cloud......
He's still alive.
Oh man...... You look like hell.
Oh man, this is real bad.
We gotta get there first and protect it!!
Cloud, it's you......
Yo, wanna see what Tifa and the gang are doing?
Damn, man. Just a little bit more an' I woudda smashed him......
Looks like the Lifestream's settled down now too.
Yo! You awright!? Tifa!?
Don't worry about him. He's a tough one.
Awright, I know... I shouldn't have doubted him.But I can't win against you. You're some kinda lady.
Yo, Tifa! Snap outta it!!Tifa......!?
Illusion, huh...? Pretty damn strong for a 'lusion, I'd say.
That means there ain't no difference from before!
Good!! Then you're gonna keep fightin' to save the planet!?
Oh, uh, you mean that!
The train we on don't make no stops!
C'mon, Cloud! Don't #&$* around!We're goin' to Junon, boyeee!!
Damn, just missed it!
We're gonna help transport the Huge Materia... Reno!
Damn! So they was just buyin' time!?
We ain't jes' gonna let them take the Huge Materia, are we?
Come on, Cloud! Follow me!Damn, man!! ......what the...?Hey yo! Remember I was the leader first, man!Yo! We come a long ways since we got on that train!Lotsa things changed! This and that.
Stop your blubberin'!! How we gonna move this without you?
Arrrrrrrgh!!EY!! Looks likes we're almost on our way! Just keep on fiddlin' with it!!It's all up to you!
Don't worry!If it breaks down, I'll smack it one--that'll fix it!
Is it us?
Shit! What's all this 'Climbing!' crap? Gimme a break!
Whatcha gonna do!?
Yo!! Junon airport?
Yeah! I could go for that! Let's go to the submarine dock under Junon!
Let's go after it!
But where to?
Them Shinra guys think they're gonna fight Meteor with the Huge Materia?
Can't we do somethin'? We can't jus' leave it.
Hey wait a second!What's gonna happen to the Huge Materia?
...damn! ...can't lift it!
What a bust... But I kinda hoped it'd work.
You're pretty damn optimistic! You up to somethin'?
Yo! Cid! You even got to me!Do, now what? How're we gonna protect the planet from Meteor?
That Bugenhagen guy... He was a weird old dude.I thought he was some kinda naturalist, but he was all into them machines.
My head feels like it's gettin' crushed.
This ain't no good with just us! Cloud, we gotta get some others in here.
Me too...
We ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean.
And Aeris... she's dead.Guess she turned into spiritual energy and returned to the planet, huh?But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again...
Whacha gonna do, Cloud? Got any good ideas?
That's 'WE'!
The thing Aeris left for us... We gotta take care of it.
Hey! What's gonna happen to Marlene!?
...that was for the life of the planet. Ya gotta expect a few casualties.
I don't wanna hear that from no one in Shinra...
That damn Weapon... He's one big *&$*&%$...Even Midgar's gonna be in trouble.
Wassup, Mr. Monster? What're you lookin' at?
Let's go back to the Highwind!
Marlene!!
Damn...
When AVALANCHE was jes startin', we used to put up flyers everywhere.And now, we're up against Sephiroth. How about that?Feels like a long time ago.
Yo, Cait Sith! Now what?
YO! Do somethin'! Ya big cat!
You're busted, Reeve!Too late tryin' to hide it now...
You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible!?
An explosion!!
Damn...!
Comin' and goin'... gettin' pushed around.But I got a debt to all them back in Midgar that I can't never repay...
Even if we get there, Midgar's under martial law!There'll be no way we could slip into the slums.
Huh? Where are we...?
Sounds strange comin' from me...But it feels like home bein' back in Midgar.Kinda makes me sick...
Leave this to me! Hurry to the cannon!
What the... hell is that!!?
Hey! This is...
This is great. Hold on, Hojo......!
Anyway... that's the end of the cannon...
Don't ask me that.
Don't be thinkin' you're gonna lose before ya even fight!
You're right...It sounds cool sayin' it's to save the planet.But I was the one who blew up that Mako reactor......Lookin' back on it now, I can see that wasn't the right way to do things.I made a lot of friends and innocent bystanders suffer......At first, it was revenge against Shinra. For attackin' my town.But now......Yeah. I'm fightin' for Marlene.For Marlene... For Marlene's future...Yeah... I guess I want to save the planet for Marlene's sake...
O, oh...... is that okay with you?
Well lookey-here. The Shinra Manager's come back.
I guess that's everyone.
She ain't gonna show up.'Least this time she didn't steal our materia. Guess we gotta be thankful for that.
We didn't come back for your spikey headed ass!We came back for Marlene. Guess it's jes' my...... whatcha call, feelings or somethin'.I, uh I ain't got now words now......
Heh heh...... heh heh heh... Time's got a way of sneakin' up on ya, huh?I'm shakin' all over... Heh heh... I feel sick...
All right. Then I'll go...
Well...... Looks like this is our last big job!
Cloud which way you gonna choose?
All right, I'm goin'...
Ain't no way I'm gonna die until I stick this into that guy.
Yo, we're a bit late?
Here, Cloud.
Oh yeah, Yuffie, didn't you find somethin'?
Awright, this's the last dance!
What?
Cloud! You go first!
Shu'up! It won't do us no good wit' everyone back here!
Cloud! Hurry up and make up your mind!
Yeah, later.
What's that!?
Oww... damn, man!
What...? So everyone's together again...?
Ugh...! Is this...... the true power of Sephiroth?
Urrrrrgh!!Not only Aeris...Holy is the prayer of AVALANCHE...of Marlene and Dyne... And everyone on the planet!
Wait! What about Holy? What's gonna happen to the Planet?
Heeeey!
(turning to Cid)They all seem to be safe, too.But...now what're we going to do?
Wait a damn minute!What's going to happen to Midgar?We can't let that happen!
What the hell IS that......?
