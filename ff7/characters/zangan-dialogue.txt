......HmmmmIs Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?
I'm . I travel around the world teaching children martial arts.I have 128 students all over the world!In this town, a girl named Tifa is my student.
Tifa has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter.I want to see some Shinra techniques.And if you see anything you can use, you might want to incorporate some of my techniques.Well, good luck.
Oh? Did you come crying home?
There's nothing that'll harm the town, right?
The Shinra showed up to eliminate any information that could be an embarrassment to the company...You pick these things up when you travel as much as I do.
...Oh my. You sure do have faith.
Hey it's you! You're still sane, right?
Then come over here and help me!I'll check this house. You check that one over there!
