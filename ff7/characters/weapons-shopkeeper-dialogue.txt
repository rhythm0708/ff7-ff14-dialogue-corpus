He, HEY! Waitaminit you!!You can't just walk outta here without buyin' somethin'...Might be unhealthy fer ya, if ya know what I mean.
Take care of yourself. It's the law of the slums. But to do that, first you need weapons, right?
You never know what's going to happen! It's a crazy world,so you'd better at least have a weapon you can depend on! Am I right or what?
This is the Weapons Store.
If you see a weapon you want, you'd better buy it.
I've got nothing to sell to you! Come back later!
Oh! Welcome!We don't have anything special now. I kind of messed up the last time I ordered but feel free to look around!
...You want something?
One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in it...Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result.It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find pieces of it left all over town.
Oh, welcome.The people of this canyon hate to compete. So almost everything here are replicas.But that's all right. Some of them you can really use.
A gun is a MAN'S weapon! Ain't nuthin' else'll do!Let me handle all your weapon and accessory needs!
Sorry, listen I... No, nothing... never mind.
Hey yo! Welcome!Strike while the iron's hot, I say! We got some of the best blades right out of the furnace!
Hey! Yo! You want weapons?
Weapon was really something. Nothing can compare with his strength, but with a selection like this, our weapons'll win.
Welcome. You still want more weapons? You sure are weird...Uh, I mean, it's weird. if there weren't people like you, I'll be out of business. Heh, heh, heh... sweat...!
My store was all right!
I don't know crap about crap! But I do know one thing.The one thing that you'll always need is a good strong weapon!
