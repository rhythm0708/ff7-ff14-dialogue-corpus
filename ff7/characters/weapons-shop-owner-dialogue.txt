You goin' up to the plate? You better have a Battery.
Hey, you knew? But I repaired it, so it's all right.
You'll find out when you get there. How 'bout 100 Gil for each?
Come again.
Hmm, looks like you're a little short, son. Come back again.
All right then, go see for yourself. You'll be back again.
Oh, so you're back? I got something good for you. Why don't you buy it?
I'll admit that I found it, but you may never be able to get another one like it again.How 'bout 129,000 Gil for it?
Hey, much obliged. You'll never regret it!
Hmm, that's too bad. This's really something.
