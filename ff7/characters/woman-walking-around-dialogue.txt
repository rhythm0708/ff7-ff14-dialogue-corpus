What am I doing? I'm walking around looking at the ground.You find a lot of things people dropped when you look down. You never find them when you're looking up. Right?
Never thought that would come tumbling down. Maybe I better walk around looking up from now on.
I'm not going to look up or down! From now on I'm just going to look straight ahead.Maybe not. I'm just flapping my gums. I really wonder how things will turn out.
