What a disaster.Heidegger was really irritated...The man in the Black Cape's been roaming the city, but we can't find him.
He showed up two or three days ago, and killed a few of our soldiers.He disappeared right after that. There's a rumor going around that it was Sephiroth.
I'll help, sir!Me too, sir!
Woo----ow!That's awesome!
Yes sir!!
That was close.Heidegger's been really edgy lately.Because Hojo disappeared, leaving a letter of resignation.Heidegger's been forced to take care of that investigation, too.
There they are, catch 'em!!
You can't pass.
Yes ma'am!!
This village is now under martial law!
Weirdo!!
Y, you...!You're not taking over this ship!
You want the Sub? Just try an' take it!Um... sir! Maybe we shouldn't piss them off...
We don't have much time left! I don't want to die!There's still so much more I've got to do!I never even got to do my special victory dance in battle!
Yes, sir!!
Yes, sir!!
I thank you! I am happy to be a hostage!Piloting a submarine is very difficult! I am completely clueless!
