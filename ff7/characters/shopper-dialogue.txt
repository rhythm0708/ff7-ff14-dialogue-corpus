You again! You aren't here hoarding up goods too are you?Don't reach in front of me! Everything in this store is mine!I've got money to burn! I've been saving it like mad just for a time like this!C'mon, outta the way! Move, will you? Move!
Ohh...... there's not much time left!! You never know when that moon is gonna come crashing down!!When it all comes down to it, this world's about money and material things!If you got 'em, you can get by whenever, wherever!Gotta buy!! Gotta buy, buy, buy!! I'm gonna shop till I drop!!
Hee, hee. Welcome. It's here. The day's finally come! Your day to shop!!Do we have items and weapons!? Well, I should say so. And here's a bargain! What would you say to 50% off everything?Just kidding. Even I wouldn't do something like that. Now what can I do for you today?Thank you. Come again!
