But a bunch of hardworking deckhands like you wouldn't understand.On the marine blue sea, Gazing at the eternal skies that seem to go on forever... Gives you the feeling like you're taking a nap on the wing of a Cessna.It's the ultimate high!
He's quite handsome, isn't he?......Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you.I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond... He even looks good in a double-breasted suit.
Today's a great day for a nap in the sun. It always puts me in a good mood!
Not gonna be able to nap like this for much longer.When you put it that way, I feel kind of sad.
