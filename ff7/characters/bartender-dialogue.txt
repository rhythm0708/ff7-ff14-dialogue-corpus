It seems there was this group called AVALANCHE runnin' around, but I guess they finally got wiped out by SOLDIER.Shinra is trying to eliminate anyone, who stands up to them.It don't matter if we like it or not. Shinra's taken over, and we gotta live with it!
I'm sorry. The bar is only for Shinra employees.
I heard Shinra's taking all its biggest artillery from Junon and its various other facilities and gathering it in Midgar to fight the meteor and Weapon.What's going to happen to the world...?
