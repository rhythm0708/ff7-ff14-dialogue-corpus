My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!
So things have come to this... When you want to take off, just tell the pilot on the bridge.
......Well......... Um, what should I talk about?Wanna hear why we rebelled?
Working on the Highwind, we spent every day slaving under Heidegger.Whenever he got yelled at by the President, he'd immediately take it out on the crew.We put up with this all the time. Even when he beat us.I mean, I finally made it on the crew of the famous Highwind, and there's no way I was going to quit over him.Let's see, it must've been a week ago... it was my shift and we were heading towards the North Cave.Everyone, including the President and Scarlet, got on.And with them, I saw Cid, a legendary pilot!And he was looking around the inside of the ship looking really, y'know, nostalgic......He even talked to us.I couldn't believe it! I was so impressed! He was every bit as warmhearted as we'd always heard.Cid said that if he had the Highwind, things would be a lot easier.And now here we are off to save the planet. It's true. He really overwhelmed me.And that's why we decided to help.After the North Cave, we went to Junon, and I started screaming 'Fire! Fire!'In the middle of all the commotion, we stole this ship from the Shinra.That's how it happened. .......Just a minor mutiny against our leaders.But Barret and you were captured by Heidegger......We waited seven days for a chance to rescue you guys, before we finally could.So thanks to our successful mission, we were able to see you again.I hope I didn't bore you too much with that long story.
My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!
Huh? Did I forget Cid? You're testing me on whether I forgot or not!
I'm not just shooting the breeze! I'm also working!
