Really! I really appreciate it.......I'm sorry but, young lady? Would you turn the other way, for a second?
I'm sorry, lady.Now here's the thing. Do you know that vending machine in the Inn?I'm itchin' to know what they're selling in it. I just can't ask a girl to go get it.What? Why don't I buy it myself? Well to tell you the truth, I got in a fight with the guy at the Inn and can't go there anymore. Come on, so how 'bout it?

I'm sorry, we're sold out and I've got nothing for you.
Living in a place like this, you could live out several lives,and it still wouldn't be enough!Well, how about some materia? Make some money and then scramble out of here!
This is the Materia Store.
Hello. I'm sorry but we're not selling anything now.We're using everything we have for ourselves.
Hello. Do your best. We will, too.
Come on, forget about your job! Step right up!!
Welcome!I was just starting to get worried... You see our sales were pretty bad today.
There's lots of stores in Junon.If we don't do this... we can't compete.But, what bothers me is that the girls make more than me.
...num... yawn... Sir,... You... forgot...... your...... change....num... Yes, I'm coming...Are you here to shop?
Oh... is that so... You're here to shop?
Come on in!Welcome!!I just can't believe it. I never thought a monster like Weapon really existed.
Oh man... Everything is over, once the meteor hits...I've been selling Materia for 10 years now, ever since I was 16. What have I been doing with my life...?Welcome! Oh, it's nothing. Now, please make yourselves comfortable!
Welcome. Just what you need at time like this--a shop of rest and relaxation. What you want?Thank you! We don't have many goods but you coming again, please.
And I just got together enough money to get out of this place...Now it doesn't matter where I go! Ho, ho, ho...
