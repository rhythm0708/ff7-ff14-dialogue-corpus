Is that so? You brought Nanaki back here?Yeah, thanks.
Mmm...What is it?
You can't talk of the Ancients, without mentioning Professor Gast.He used to come here sometimes.He was a Shinra scholar who spent his life studying the Ancients.He was a serious person, never would have figured he'd be with the Shinra.Must've been about 30 years ago, when he found the corpse of an Ancient. He was elated!If I recall... he named it 'Jenova' and was doing a lot of research...One day, he showed up here, looking real distressed.He was mumbling something about Jenova not being an Ancient and that he'd done a terrible thing...He's been missing since then. I heard that he never went back to ShinraSo, if you ever see Professor Gast, I want you to tell him...That the old man that likes to drink in Cosmo Canyon, wanted to hear about the Ancients.Well, there's lots to talk about,but most things about the Ancients are all legend and folk tales, and no one knows the truth.
...hmm. That's no fun... I wanna tell a story.
By the way, your friends are all in front of the 'Cosmo Candle'Are you all leaving now?
Mmm. I'm starting to feel good now. That bartender's cocktails always hit the spot.
Live with the planet, die with the planet.Maybe this is the way it should be. Who knows? I'm full of booze...It's when I think about the children. I wonder if we could just save our own children.
Where is the Promised Land...? Maybe Bugenhagen knows.Isn't Nanaki starting to notice? The reason why Bugenhagen sent him away from the canyon...
