This is Mog's house. It's in Mog Forest on Mt. Mog.The beginning of another day in the life of a Mog.This year, Mog is pipapopupo years old. ...that's 28 in human years. He's at that age when he should be looking for a mate.But before Mog can become an adult, he first needs to learn how to fly.Even though Mog trains hard everyday... He still can't seem to get off the ground...
Looks like he's still got a long way to go...Here's where you come in. Help Mog learn how to fly by pushing O button and feeding him his favorite Kupo nut.But don't overfeed him. He won't be able to fly if he's too fat.
Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it.
Poor Mog. It looks like he'll have to wait some time for a mate.Poor Mog, seems like he'll be alone for a while.
He did it! He's flying! Now, he's finally become a full-fledged Mog.
Tired but relaxed, our little Mog turns out the lights early and goes to bed. Good night, and sweet dreams......
Oh?... What's this? Here comes a female Mog!
Seems he likes her too...Now, will Mog be able to fly gracefully in front of her? Help him out with a few kupo nuts.
Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it.
Unfortunately, he didn't make it. Poor Mog'll have to wait some time for a bride.Poor Mog, seems like he'll be alone for a while.
He's flying!! Mog was able to do it!She must have fallen for his graceful flying form.
Looks like things are going good with his new Mog-friend. Time for a quiet date in the forest.Her name is Mag. She is a good-natured Mog.
Best of luck to the both of you, Mog and Mag. May you have lots and lots of healthy Mogs!
