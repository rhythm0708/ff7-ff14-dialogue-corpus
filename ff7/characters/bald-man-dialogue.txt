You see the headlines in the Shinra Times?The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere in the slums....blowing up a Reactor... they sure put some thought into this one.They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll do next?
......guess it's been about a week now since he washed up here on the shore... Poor pokey-headed young thing...
Yeah... a villager found him a little ways down the coast... It was about a week ago I think.
Yeah... up ahead here... At the, uh, clinic......
It's amazing he recovered. When they carried him here after they first discovered him, I thought for sure he was a goner.That boy must have one powerful guardian angel watchin' over him.
Hey, you feelin' all better now? That's good, real good.Now don't overdo yourself like that again, hear?
