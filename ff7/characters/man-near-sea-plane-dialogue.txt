Heh, heh... I hear the Shinra brass are arriving soon.Heh, heh...! Got nothing to do with us, does it?
Hey! Spread out, all of you, out!!Put any fingerprints, scratches, or dents on that plane and I'll put one in your head!Da plane, da plane!! This's something you'll never be able to do in your lifetime.So you just watch from a distance... and wish.
Hey, who're you? You look like you've been around the world twice.I don't know what your story is, but hang in there.
Well, I'm not worried. When it all comes down, I'm heading for the skies.The only problem is...... will there be anywhere left to land?
