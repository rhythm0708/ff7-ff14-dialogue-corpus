Whew, times are bad.
I own the Clothes Shop... but I ain't your father.
I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin' anything right now.
What!? A tough lookin guy like that?
...might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just makin' regular clothes.
Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?
Hmm, got it. Y'know I got a friend that has the same taste as him. I'll go talk to him.Hey, hold on. Wait till I get an image in my head. Gulp... ummm, that's good.
Oh, you're here. It's ready. Go try it on.
Umm, I thought you might, so I talked to my friend about getting one.You know the gym? You'll find a lot of people there like you. Go and talk to them.
So, how was it? Were you able to see him?
Looks like you're all set. Now try it on, and let's see how it fits.
Hmm, not bad. This may be a new business for me.
How about that one?
No, what are you saying? This one.
Hmm, good. It looks good on you.
You're dressed normal today. If something else interesting comes up, let me in on it.
