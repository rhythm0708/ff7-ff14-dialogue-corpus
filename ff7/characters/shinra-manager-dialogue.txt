This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy...
...hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck...
DAMN!!I... it's empty because of... g, guys like you...
Y, Y, YIPES!!You... you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be more bombings.Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like today.
I won't give in to violence... and I'm not giving up my seat either!
Waaaaah!!Don... don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man...!! I'm gonna brag to everyone at work about this...)
It's so shameful!...and they told me that I would be staying at five star hotels on these trips...How can you guys sleep in a place like this?
Oh, oh, oh!!! I'm gonna quit this company!!I mean it, I'm really gonna quit!!Heidegger's such an idiot!!And Rufus, acting all big!!God, that sure felt good...
I only came to help with the transporting of Junon's Huge Cannon, Sister Ray, but...Now the company tells me not to bother coming back...What's being a Shinra employee all about...?Yeeeeee......If Weapon killed all the upper management... then I'll be President...!!
