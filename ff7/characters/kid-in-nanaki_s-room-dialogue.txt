It's not that I'm afraid of that big star.It's just that, uh, I have a stomach ache... That's why I'm not moving. That's the truth!
Both Nanaki and Mr. Bugenhagen are gone... I feel so lonely...
He's finally come home, but Mr. Bugenhagen doesn't seem well...I want to hear Mr. Bugenhagen's talk with Nanaki like we used to do...
Nanaki, is it true that Mr. Bugenhagen left on a journey? Then that means he's better, right? He IS going to come back soon, right?
Yea, that's right! 'Ho Ho Hoooo'!It's Ho Ho Hoooo! Ho Ho Hoooo!
