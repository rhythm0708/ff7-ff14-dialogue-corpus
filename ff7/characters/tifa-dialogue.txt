Marlene! Aren't you going to say anything to Cloud?
I should have known.He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in fights ever since you were little.I was worried.
Hmm. You've grown up.When you were little you used to get into fights at the drop of a hat.
Flowers? How nice...You almost never see them here in the slums.But...A flower for me? Oh Cloud, you shouldn't have...
Thank you, Cloud. It smells wonderful.Maybe I should fill the store with flowers.
I'm so glad everyone's safe.
Sorry, Cloud. Marlene seems a little shy.
You all right, Barret?
Sit down.
How about......something to drink?
OHH!!I can make a drink just as good as anyone else.Everyone says, my drinks taste the best!
Just a minute. I'll make one for you.You know, I'm relieved you made it back safely.
I guess not...You were in SOLDIER.Make sure you get your pay from Barret.
Cloud. Are you feeling all right?
No reason. You just look a little tired I guess.You'd better go down below.
Wait, Cloud!
Straighten things up with everyone for me.
Listen, Cloud. I'm asking you. Please join us.
The Planet is dying. Slowly but surely it's dying.Someone has to do something.
So! You're really leaving!?You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood friend!?
(she says the same thing regardless)......You forgot the promise, too.
So you DID forget.Remember...... Cloud. It was seven years ago...
Look, the well.Do you remember?
Sorry I'm late.You said you wanted to talk to me about something?
...All boys are leaving our town.
Sephiroth... The Great Sephiroth.
Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?
Will you be in the newspapers if you do well?
Hey, why don't we make a promise?Umm, if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind......You come save me, all right?
Whenever I'm in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me.I want to at least experience that once.
Come on--! Promise me----!
You remember now, don't you... our promise?
But you got your childhood dream, didn't you? You joined SOLDIER.So come on! You've got to keep your promise......
What? Then you'll...!!
It's ok, it's ok.psst, psst...... (We're really hurting for help, right?)
Thanks, Cloud.
Good Morning! Cloud!Did you sleep well?
psstpsst...(keep it down, they'll hear you. Barret's always edgy before an operation.)
I don't know what you mean.
I'm going this time.
Cloud! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs.He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget!Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone!
Barret!!
Seems like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally leaving.
Which Shinra is very proud of.
That means we've got only three more minutes to the ID Check point.
Cloud, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor.
Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already...It's all right. Come a little closer.
That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down.
What's happening?
...Scary... huh.
Because...
Yeah!! I've made up my mind!Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!!
Oh well...
We got a lot of battles ahead of us. This's going to be tough.
That didn't do anything!
Phew-----! Be strong!
We were almost there.
Don't worry! Don't worry!
...There seems to be nothing that'll get us stuck in this duct.
Papa...Sephiroth!?Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything!I hate them all!
You all right?
Mmm?
Jessie said we all have to push the buttons at once.
No good. Let's try it again.
Why is the President here?
!? What's that noise?
Help, Cloud!THIS is from SOLDIER?
Barret! Can't you do something?
Cloud! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much I want to tell you!
...And you are?Hey you're the one with Cloud in the park...
Oh......
What do you mean, 'Don't worry'... about what?No, don't misunderstand.Cloud and I grew up together. Nothing more.
Cloud?
????
Oh, Aeris did...
Yeah, ummm......
...I'm glad you're OK.
When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird man.So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him.
Right, Don Corneo.Barret told me to leave the lech alone...But something's been bothering me.
So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind.Corneo is looking for a bride.Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then... ...and, well......Anyway, I have to be the girl... or I'm out for tonight.
I guess so, but...
Is it all right?
Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aeris.
You're right, there was no need...
Ha ha... You know, if you look closely, you're not so bad...I wonder what Barret would say if he could see you now...
Fu, fu, fu... Be nice, Don.
I know......But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something before we start...
No... I'm not asking about that......Wa... wait a minute! No, not yet!!
Cloud!!
You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?
Cloud!!
Of course! If you take me lightly, you're gonna pay for it!!
Hey, don't you even care about how I am? ......never mind, let's go!
Cloud...Were you really......
Shut up, we're asking the questions now...What did your assistants find out? Talk! If you don't tell us...
So... talk.
By who?
Talk! If you don't tell us...
Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk!If you don't tell us......I'll smash them.
Break the support!?
They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?Cloud, will you come with me to Sector 7?
Man! This is terrible.
It's too late...... Marlene... Barret... the people of the Slums.
.........Yeah...... you're right! We still have time.
Let's see... If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, we should be able to get out of here.
We made it! The pillar's standing!
Aeris, do me a favor.I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood.There's a little girl named Marlene there......
It's dangerous here!Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly!Everyone get out of Sector 7!
Cloud!! You've gotta go now, or Barret's...
Better equip ourselves before they attack in full force!Here they come!
We have to disarm it! Cloud! Barret! Please!
Cloud! I don't know how to stop this. Try it!
Please, stop it!
Aeris!!
Aeris!
Once that Plate starts coming down it'll be too late. We gotta hurry!
Barret!
Barret, stop... Please stop, Barret.
......... Barret......?Marlene is... I think Marlene is safe.
Right before they took Aeris, she said, "Don't worry, she's all right." She was probably talking about Marlene.
But...
...and the other people in Sector 7.
...are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? Innocent people lost their lives because of us?
.........I don't know.
It's not that. I'm not sure about... me. My feelings.
Oh! Aeris!
...I don't really know... But she's the one I left Marlene with.
Cloud!
You're going to help Aeris?
What's that?
Are you all right?
But why now......
It's my fault... I was the one who got Aeris involved in this.
I feel so depressed.
You're going after Aeris, right?
I'm coming with you.
I know.Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit.If I stayed here... I'll go crazy.
How do we get to the Shinra Building?
......Well, let's just go to Wall Market. We might be able to find something there.
Can we climb it?
You're right. This is the only way to save Aeris...
Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through the main entrance, are you?
That's not going to work! We've got to find another way...
I know that! But if we get caught here...Hey, Cloud. ...What should we do?
......What's wrong?
Look!
What's going on!?
See? Let's be careful and find a different route!
Well, we've got to get to Aeris to help her somehow.
I don't have time to argue with you. I'm going!
Wait a minute, Cloud!
heh heh heh......
Why don't you ask them?
Of course not!!
Not yet.
I said not yet!
Look, don't even ask! We're way way way way far away from being there yet, ok!?
And take just as long going down as you did coming up?
C'mon, Barret. Pull it together!
What about me!? I'm human too! Oh, do what you want, I'm going on!
All right, all right!Cloud, you go on ahead too!!
...I gave up counting.
.........
Would you stop acting like a retard and climb!?It's just a bit more!...maybe.
huff... puff... this really takes it out of you...But this is it. We'd better get ready...!
I hope Aeris is all right.
Stay in the shadows!
Shhh! Now let's move on.
Remember, we're here to save Aeris.
Probably.
Precious specimen...?Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?
Cloud, be strong!
...animal? That's terrible! Aeris is a human being!
Cloud... what's wrong?
It talked!?
She seems all right, ...in many ways.
We'll be going first! Meet at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Where are you going? Everyone's waiting for us at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Psst (Can we get out?)
Psst (Cloud, you're so brave!)
Psst (Don't give up!)
............oh, I get it.
EXCUSE me.You know, Aeris. I have a question.
Does the Promised Land really exist?
...What does that mean?
Just what does the Planet say?
......
What's wrong?
I wonder what happened...
This's kinda eerie...
Come on, let's follow Red XIII!
Then this sword must be...!?
...Sephiroth is alive?
Then what?Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?
Who's that?
I wonder what kinda person he is...
Same here!
He likes to make speeches just like his father.
...I'll wait for Cloud! Everyone, get to the elevator!
Where's Rufus?
Barret!!
Everyone, over here!
I'll tell you later! Hurry, Hurry!!
I guess this's good bye, Midgar.
...I guess this is the start of our journey...
...I don't know. But, I don't have anywhere else to go. So I guess it doesn't really matter whether I like to travel or not.
......Mmm. But you know, it should be all right if you keep your promise.
You think so...?
...combination.Well, have fun with just the guys.We'll see you at Kalm!
Hey, Cloud. Wasn't Kalm right before this cavern?
Kalm should be closer to Midgar.
So this is Kalm?
Everyone's waiting at the inn. Let's go Cloud.
Let's go Cloud.
.........
.........
Barret, would you please let us hear what Cloud has to say? You can ask questions later.
Okay Cloud, continue.
Cloud...?Did you go into my house?
Cloud...?Did you go into my room?
Did you play my piano?
Did you read it? My letter?
Of course!
Do you remember what it said...?
Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.
Cloud... Do you remember all of it?
Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.
Cloud!!!
(she says the same thing regardless)...CloudWe're talking about something really important here.
I'll be all right, Dad!I have two men from SOLDIER with me.I'm . Nice to meet you!
That's right.I just happen to be the number one guide in this town.
It gets harder from here! Follow me!
Uh... the bridge!!
These caves are intertwined, just like an ant farm...Oh, and Sephiroth... There seems to be one person missing...
A mysteriously colored cave...
It's so beautiful...
A Mako fountain... So this is where the knowledge of the Ancients is.
We finally made it. We sure took the long way though.
I'm going inside too! I wanna see!
But!
Mm, man!Better take real good care of me then!
......who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret like that.
......Yes.
Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?
The villagers used to call it Shinra mansion.
Papa...Sephiroth!?Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything!I hate them all!
How could you do that to papa and all the townspeople?
...You promised... You promised that you'd come...... when I was in trouble...
Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the newspaper.
......I'm alive, too.
Sephiroth......?
.........Cloud...?How bad was I when Sephiroth cut me?
.........
Let's go. Barret's waiting.
Oh, Cloud. Let me give you this.
Just use [PHS], and you can contact any one of us easy.
I'm going on ahead.
Amazing...
Who are you?
Cloud, do you know her?
She's gone... What is it with her?Hey! My money!
Wait a second! Where's my money!?
- What did you say!?- Don't fight
She's gone... What is it with her?Hey! My money!
Wait a second! Where's my money!?
- ......petrified.- You're outta your league!
- Yeah, so?- Wait a second!
She's gone... What is it with her...?
- ......That's right- No way!
- What's your name?- Come on, let's hurry!
She's gone... What is it with her?Hey! My money!
Wait a second! Where's my money!?
She's gone... What is it with her...?
She's gone... What is it with her?Hey! My money!
Wait a second! Where's my money!?
- I'm sorry... really- All right, we'll help
What?
You mean Shinra?
Cloud, let's listen to what they have to say.
Oh, by all means.
Come on, let's get it together.
That's the reactor and the condor.
What's so wrong with having a condor on top of the reactor?
Condors' eggs. A real work of nature.We've got to protect the life of the planet.
Cloud......
Cloud, thanks.
Well......
Everyone, listen to what I have to say.I can't possibly leave these people like this.Let's do whatever we can to help them. All right?
Say, let's take a rest. Okay?
No... stay calm...
Look at that!
Cloud, what are you going to do?
Take a rest?
Hey wake up. Wake up, Cloud!
...We saw each other, right?
No... it was 5 years ago. I don't remember.But, something seems strange outside. Cloud, come quick.
Doesn't it seem a little strange? Everything getting so noisy all of a sudden...?
High voltage tower......I guess this means Cloud'll be all right.
Don't you just hate this?
Yes sir! Everything quiet, sir!...But, you know what? I really hate this uniform.Uniforms, soldiers, war, I hate 'em all.They take away all the things and people you love...I wish they'd all disappear. Right, Cloud?
You're right!Uh, yes sir, I'll continue my watch sir! Hee hee...
...Cloud. Wearing those clothes seems to have changed you a little.Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not...
Everyone all right!?
Everyone's here... right?
Really!?
Take me with you!
Cloud, look!!
I've seen this somewhere... before.
Jenova... He's been carrying this thing around?
He said something about it being time for something.
I'm getting so confused...Cloud, explain what's happened so far.
We should hide somewhere again.
Right... well, uh...Barret, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?Right, Cloud?
I think I'll go swimming.
Look, look at that!
Go over and talk to him.
What're you looking at?That man over there. That's Hojo from Shinra. Get outta here Go talk to him!
Go over and talk to him.
Stop, Cloud! I know how you feel, but you mustn't.
Hey! Answer us!!
Oh, right! I remember that, too.
Hee, hee, hee!
Ha, ha... oh stop it! That's right. Oh really......
Yeah, yeah!
Cloud, would you mind leaving us alone for the day?We haven't seen each other for ages and sometimes it's fun to talk about old times for a change.We'll try not to be too late.So please don't worry about us!
You're right......
Ok, I know.
Let's hurry on.
OH!! Cloud! That's it!We can't go on until the bridge is let down.I think there's a switch in that shack over there...But there's too many monsters around and I'm beat...
I'm beat...
Cloud!! Go Cloud!! Go!!
Yes!! ...how cute.
Oh! Cloud! Your hair looks like a Chocobo!
Right! That was admirable of you.
That's so terrible!
Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra made back then.
I never knew. Barret never said a thing...
.........We better go on!
I never knew. Barret never said a thing...
....whisper... whisper... (Wasn't that a little harsh, Aeris!?)
...whisper... (You think so...?)
He'll be fine. He seems to be doing a little better now.
We'd better be careful, Sephiroth might be around.
Cloud!I'll go with you.
What?
Oh, how pretty.Look, Cloud.Oh, Cloud.Look, look.Look, there.
What does it say?
Excuse me?
Is it all right, Cloud?
Hey, Cloud, Are we going back without the others?
What!?
Wa... wait Cloud!
A gun on his arm!?
Cloud, you all right?
Barret!?
...Barret......
Yeah. We're already involved in this.
Yeah, that's right. He was deceived by the Shinra too.He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra.
Weren't you going to save the Planet?
...That's all right. I'm not so different from you.
Be careful.
Right, Cloud. We'll be waiting and rooting for you.
Hey, something seems wrong, Like they knew we were coming.
A spy!?...No way.
Zack...
Zack...
...No, it wasn't.
Zack......
N, no, I don't know him!
I told you, I don't!
............That sounds just like you, leaving town, and saying 'I'm joining SOLDIER!'.
You must really be something making it in SOLDIER out of a group like that.I really respect you...
Don't be so humble!
Hard work pays off, huh.
Cloud, thanks for caring.
Red XIII seems different, doesn't he?
That's perfect. Why don't we take a break too? We can meet back here in a while, OK?
Nanaki...... I wonder what's happened to Nanaki...? He's as excited as a little boy.
Are you going somewhere?
Wow! It's just like the real thing!
Look, look! A shooting star!
Oh! This is amazing!!
Cloud...Bonfires are funny, aren't they?They make you remember all sorts of things.You know, Cloud. 5 Years ago.........It's nothing.No, forget it. I'm afraid to ask...
It feels like... it feels like you're going far away...You really, really are...... you... right?
Can I go too?
What---!!
Then why...? My house is still there too...
You're lying...
How bad was your dream?
What's he talking about...?
...That's for sure.
Just like you said, this mansion is the start of a nightmare...No, not a dream... it's reality.Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion...
Hmm... I'm disappointed.
, formerly of the AVALANCHE.
So the punishment was sleep? That's weird.
Hmm, I don't know. But we're going after Hojo and Sephiroth. So, we might......
What? You're coming with us?
All right, I understand.
I wonder if we can borrow it...
. Nice to meet you.
Poor Shera.
Is it always like this...? Why is Cid so hard on you?
It won't stop!
Of course, no problem!
What the--? Did something happen?
...Really? Somehow,...I don't believe it.Are you trying to con us again...?
Shinra!?
Yuffie, you're not......!
This one? Did you just say 'THIS one'?So you WERE trying to pull something off!
What's going on!?I thought something was fishy... My, my materia is missing!!
Hey... where's Yuffie...?
She's done it to us again!!I'm never gonna forgive her!She was after our materia from the beginning.I won't let her get away with it! I'm pretty sure she ran off North. Let's go after her!!
I can't just leave it there...
Knowing Yuffie, she's still hidden somewhere in town. You sure?
Give it up, Yuffie!
I'm sorry, Yuffie. I know how you feel, but we need materia too....We just can't let you have it. Please understand.
Now, the Materia...
Eyaaaaah
W...wait don't leave us here!
Oh! You're......!
Don Corneo!?
......all right. Corneo stole Yuffie from us, as well.And without her, there's no way we'll get our materia back.
The same goes for us. We don't want to be friendly with the Turks.Now which direction did Corneo run off in?
Eyaaaah!There is no way past this!
Hold it right there!
That fall into the trap really hurt!
We don't want to hear it! Just let the two go!
You better say your prayers!
Coward!
Th... Thanks.
Hey, what is this...? The placement of it's all messed up!
...after that, how can we refuse?
I'll show 'em with a BANG!
So Sephiroth is traveling the world because he's searching for the Promised Land? Is that it?
I don't even know what the Black Cape is...How many men with Black Capes and number tattoos are there?
So there are at least 13!?
I don't know what Hojo did to you, but you've been all right so far, right?
Be strong.
Stop it, Nanaki! Be strong!
You're not the only one who's worried!
Cloud...
......I thought about what I was going to say, but, it's kinda embarrassing...Hey, Cloud!Why don't the two of us sneak out of here and spend some time together?
Come on, let's go.
Sounds like fun. Come on Cloud, let's give it a try.
Please help me...Legendary hero!...Like that?
Cloud... I mean, Alfred...
H, hey, what is it?That can't be the end!!
Cloud!! Be serious!! You really don't want to be in the play that much!?Now I'm mad!
Shut up!!
Please help me...Legendary hero!...Like that?
H, hey, what is it?That can't be the end!!
Cloud!! Be serious!! You really don't want to be in the play that much!?Now I'm mad!
Shut up!!
Cloud!! Be serious!! You really don't want to be in the play that much!?Now I'm mad!
Shut up!!
Please help me...Legendary hero!...Like that?
Cloud... I mean, Alfred...
H, hey, what is it?That can't be the end!!
H, hey, what is it?That can't be the end!!
Please help me...Legendary hero!...Like that?
Wh, what is this?You can't do this!
Cloud!! Be serious!! You really don't want to be in the play that much!?Now I'm mad!
Shut up!!
Cloud!! Be serious!! You really don't want to be in the play that much!?Now I'm mad!
Shut up!!
Hmm, that was funny. Hey, let's go on the Gondola next.
Two, please.
Oh, how pretty.Look, Cloud.Oh, Cloud.
Aeris would be able to just come out and say it, probably.Cloud...?Sometimes being old friends is hard.I mean, timing is everything.
Cloud...?I..............................
Cloud I really had fun tonight.
N, nothing!Nothing...
Oh, look at the time. We should be getting back.
That's...... Cait Sith. He seems strange.
We've got no time to relax. Let's go after Cait Sith!
There's no time to be riding this. Let's hurry after Cait Sith!
There's no time to waste. Let's hurry and go after Cait Sith!
There's no time to waste. Let's hurry after Cait Sith!
We got no time to relax. Let's hurry and go after Cait Sith!
There's no time to relax. Let's hurry after Cait Sith!
Don't mess with us!
So you're from Shinra. Who are you?
You're lying again.
Marlene!
......Marlene.
You know...... no, forget it. Let's go.
Number 9. Another man with a tattoo.
What a strange place. Do you think we're welcome here?
...I saw it.
We're here too, you know.
Here it comes!
Hey, Cloud!
Is something going to fall from the sky?
Let's just leave it, OK?
I'll wait here.
Cloud!!
Cloud, what are you doing!?
You know, Cloud. Aeris is gone.
Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to Aeris? If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble.
Let's go, Cloud.
Cloud, we came this far... Aren't you going to settle up with Sephiroth?
Cloud... you'll come with us, right? I believe in you.
(from the next room)Cloud...
Cloud...
Cloud, it'll be all right. We're all with you.
Come on, let's go and find Aeris...?
Hey, hey Cloud.If we continue this way, we'll end up in the Northern Mountains. Aeris isn't over there, right?
Do you think the people who used to live here used it?
Shall we take a break here?
Cloud... what's wrong?
You're saying it's not just Aeris, but Sephiroth, too?
But how can you tell?
If that's true, then we've got to hurry! We've got to get to Aeris!
Stop!
...What's going on?
...But, Cloud.
Sephiroth... I wonder which way he went?
Cloud! Get a hold of yourself!!
Yeah, somehow.
Oh yeah, we got the map, right? Let's look at the map by pressing the [] button.
This blizzard's nothing! I gotta say that or... brr...
So the planet has gathered all this energy here to heal itself?
The time has come to settle things with Sephiroth, huh?
I, too, have lost many things because of Sephiroth.Let's go!
Cloud, wait for me!!Please take me with you. You're going to have it out with Sephiroth, aren't you?
Because of Sephiroth, I, too, have lost many things, so please take me along.Don't say no. Okay?......
We need to cross when the wind is calm, or we'll get swept off!
He might still be nearby......
Not Sephiroth!? You mean all this time it wasn't Sephiroth we've been after?
But Sephiroth is......
We'd better not take the Black Materia any further. Why don't you give it to someone else to hold on to?
Let's find Sephiroth!!
What is this? What happened?
Nibelheim...
Yeah, you're right...Look!!
Stop... Sephiroth.
Cloud... It's just an illusion.Don't worry about it...
Stop it already!!
I don't want to... watch this. Cloud... don't watch.
Cloud... Don't listen to him...Close your ears! Close your eyes!
All that talk of Hojo constructing you is a lie.Don't we have our memories together?Being kids together, starlit nights...
Cloud...
No, that's not true, Cloud......
That's not what I mean... I don't know how to say it...Cloud, I need some time... Just give me a little time...
Cloud...Please... don't think right now.
Cloud... don't...
......Cloud?
Barret, you're here! I'm so glad!!
Everyone's waiting! Cloud's in trouble!Please come. Help us!Over there!
......hee hee hee... And remember...
What are you so happy about, Professor? You know what this means, don't you?Cloud has the Black Materia!Sephiroth is going to summon Meteor! Every single person is going to die!
Cloud------!!
Are you all right?
...............?Oh, Cloud!
Is it really you, Cloud? I never thought I'd find you here!
What happened to you? You don't look well.
How long has it been?
............
...it's really been a long time.
...Because I'm scared.
He's still... alive, right?
How long... was I asleep?
What about Sephiroth?
...Weapon?
Weapon... is protecting Sephiroth?
Time...... Hey! How about Meteor?
Do we have to give up?
What are you going to do to Cloud?
You make me sick...
What are you doing!?
Gas!!Barret, help!!
Come on! I can't hold on forever!
Which button stops the gas...?
First you lock me in this weird place, and now you're telling me to come out? Make up your mind!
Quit slapping me! You old wench!!!
(as she slaps Scarlet)What!?Pay back!!Stop it!Same to you!!
My cheeks hurt a bid.Forget about that, what's all this about?
- Fly Airship- Chew the fat
- Listen- Don't care
- How do I?- Later
Everyone? Everyone's here?
Not enough crew.
Meteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage......At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do......No idea at all......
......If only Cloud was here, everything would be fine.Cloud would......Stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do.He'd say, 'Everything's under control, .'
I'm sorry Barret.I'm kind of shocked myself. I'm so depressed.
......I know.That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him again.
......I'll be able to see him someday.
Deep within the earth...... are you talking about the Lifestream?
- We're going- We're staying put
- Could you take care of the chocobos?- I'd like to hear about something else- Tell me how you raise them- That's all
- Rent it
- Let me jot this down- Chole's Chocobo inspection- Nothing
Maybe... he dropped some from the North Caves into the Lifestream...Sir, do you know where the Lifestream runs through?Cloud might have drifted from there.
Cloud fell into the Lifestream at the North Cave, and has been missing ever since.
- Yes- No thanks
That's why we're here... Cloud... Cloud has...
Cloud... Cloud was playing.I wonder what... this is...
- Look up- No
- Are you going to run away??- What are you doing?
Eyaaaa!...Consciousness of the Ancients?...I'm sorry. ...I can't... understand.Eaayy!? Again?It speaks directly to my mind... Is this the Consciousness of the Ancients?...I'm sorry. ...I can't... understand.
Wha? You don't know who you are?
(Who would forget that?)
Where can we find one?
What about that one right there?
So where can I find those Chocobos?...and what about those 'Carob Nuts'...
You probably are going to say you forgot, but...How can I get one of those chocobos?
What is it? You're being awful friendly all of a sudden.Oh, so that's it. You want the Samolen Greens... don't you?- Give it some Samolen Greens- Don't give it any
Well, okay. Here, go ahead and eat.
hee hee... how cute! I just want to tickle him.- Tickle his feet- Tickle his stomach- Tickle his neck- Tickle his belly button- Tickle behind his ears- Tickle under his arms
Oh, you scared me...! I thought you were dead!
Sorry, little guy. I can't give you any.
Huh......? What could that be?There's something stuck deep inside that looks like a key... It's hard to get out.Well, I'll just let it go for now......
No good... I wonder if it's locked?
I wonder if there isn't some way to get this outta here...?If I just move this...... And push that...... Okay! I got it out!
Oh yeah, shall I try that old beat up key?- Use the beat up old key!- Forget it
Ulp!?Huh? Uh, no......What am I gonna do......?- Lie your butt off!- Tell them the truth!
Whew... that was close. But that was kind of bad...
???
ShopkeeperOf course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.
What!? It's not a real door?
ShopkeeperThat's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this.
Really? Thank you.
 and the others received "Cursed Ring"!
ShopkeeperIf possible, we're hoping to pass through a dream door like that one into another worldI got the feeling that you all might be able to make my dreams come true in my place. Weird, isn't it?
What!? It's not a real door?
Really? Thank you.
What's the matter? Are you all alone?
Wha!?
Cloud!! It must be!! It's Cloud!!
So where is he? Is he safe!? Where is he now......?
He's alive...!Cloud...... Cloud's alive!!
Cloud!?
I'm sorry, but I heard that a friend of mine was being taken care of here......
Here?Over here.
Oh... Cloud!! I'm so glad you're safe!?......!?Cloud......?
Wh...... what's wrong...... Cloud......?
Cloud! What happened to you......!?
Doctor......!!
Cloud......
Why......? What do you want me to do?Please, Cloud...... Talk to me......Tell me you see me, that you can hear me...... Tell me, please......I came this far believing in the memories we have together...This isn't happening......! This is too cruel......Oh, Cloud......! I............
.........
Yes...... I'm sorry I had you all worried.And I have something I want to tell you all......
I don't care about anything else, only Cloud......I...... want to be by his side......
I'm sorry, everyone... At a time like this......
Right......
Huh!? Well... that is......No, I'm sure of it!
(after one Huge Materia mission)Cloud...... I don't understand a word he's saying......I'm such a fool...... I thought there was something that I could do for him......
(after both missions)......it's no use...... I don't understand a thing, Cloud.What should I do......? What if you never recover for the rest of your life?
Eyaaah!?
No way...... Is this......!?
(at the door)Cid......!? What's wrong?
But I......!?
Be careful...!
This is bad...... The tremors are getting worse.Wait a minute, Cloud.Doctor! Shouldn't we move him somewhere rather than stay here...?
Don't you worry about a thing, Cloud......I'll see to it that you get somewhere safe!
Yes!Ready Cloud? We're leaving now!!
Wh, where am I......? what's happening? I......?
Huh...... what......? Who......?Who is it......? I can't hear......
Cloud, help me!!Eyaaaaghh......!!
............ Where am I......?
Cloud!?What is it, Cloud? What is this......!?Is this the inside of your dreams? Or is it...... your...... subconsciousness......?You're searching, aren't you Cloud?Searching...... for yourself......I can help too. We'll work together to try and get the real you back!But...... Where do we start......?
It connects...... to Nibelheim......?That's right... It's probably best to start from there......Let's go have a look, Cloud. I know it's not easy...... But I'll be right with you......
Cloud... look.Here's the well...And that's Gramps' Inn, too.The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little kids, right?This is the Nibelheim you remember, right?It's the same as my Nibelheim. That's why this place is...... our Nibelheim.
Five Years ago... two men from SOLDIER came...Sephiroth and...... a young and vibrant soldier.Can you tell me again what happened?
Five Years ago... I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first time.
So this is... the Great Sephiroth.
But to tell you the truth, I thought he was very cold.
I remember, I felt a foreboding about him.
No, Cloud.I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you... something terrible might happen.But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore.
You weren't here. Cloud did not come to Nibelheim five years ago.
I... waited. But, Cloud... never came.The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another person...
There's nothing...... I can say......You must find the answer yourself......If you can't...... Then you......Take your time, Cloud. Slowly...... little by little, okay?
Don't hurry, Cloud...... Don't answer too quickly.Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come back...... Slowly...... little by little.......Right... like the sky that night...... the heavens were filled with stars......
From the beginning... OK?
Try and remember, Cloud.
Right, I was wearing these clothes.That's you, too. You were so small then......
Cloud, what about your other memories?No, not memories.A memory is something that has to be consciously recalled, right?That's why sometimes it can be mistaken and a different thing......But it's different from a memory locked deep within your heart......That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that memory......That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me?I say something and you don't remember it......But you say something, and I remember it, too... Then we'll know that's our memory......Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you...Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the first place?I always thought it was a sudden decision you made......
Someone to notice you...? ......who?
......Me? Why!?
Look...... I......I'm sorry...... But what are you talking about?
'Back then'?
My room?
Was... it?
Was that the first day you came into my room?...that's right.We lived next to each other.But I really didn't know you that well.I've known you since we were children and always thought we were close...Now that you mention it... I don't recall you ever being in my room...
...That's right.
What!?
But we were children, back then.
Yeah... it was so sudden. I was... a bit surprised.But...It's true that we weren't THAT close, but...After you left town, I really thought about you a lot.I used to wonder how Cloud was doing.I wonder if Cloud was able to get into SOLDIER?I started reading the newspapers, thinking that there might be an article about you.
OK!Huh?What happened on this day? Was it a special day?
The day Mom died...
I want... to see... mom...
...I wonder if there's anything beyond that mountain?
How 'bout those that died?Did mama pass through the mountains?
So that was it......Sorry, Cloud.If I had only remembered more clearly what happened, I could have done something sooner......
But, I remember back when we were eight!That's it! Now I know!You weren't created five years ago.My childhood memories weren't all made up!Hang in there Cloud! Just a little longer! You've almost found the real you!Let's go back to Nibelheim again......!
Cloud, wait.Where are you going?
Hey! It's Cloud!
You remembered!!
That's right! It was Zack who came to Nibelheim with Sephiroth!Then, where were you, Cloud?
Cloud... Did you... see it all?
Cloud!?
That's what happened...
...You were there.You were watching me.
Yeah, I remember.Hmm... so it was you.
...You came. ...You kept your promise.So you really did come when I was in trouble!
It's all right... Cloud.
Cloud......
............!?
Cloud!!
Oh, Cloud......! It's really you, isn't it?
You stupid jerk!! You had us all worried sick!!
Cloud!? Are you all right!?
I see. We're... in the Lifestream aren't we?Everyone's waiting.Let's go back, Cloud. Back to everyone......
u... unn......?
Barret...... I...... When I was in the Lifestream I saw the real Cloud.I mean, I didn't really find him. Cloud found himself on his own...
People have so many things pent up inside of themselves...And they can forget so many things......Strange...... isn't it............
You're sure messed up, Cloud!
There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!
Let's do our best, Cloud!
They're gonna take it on that submarine!
Looks like we barely made it.
We have to go after it!
Cloud--! We have to go after Rude!
What are we going to do... We stole a submarine but can't pilot it.
See!?Just fiddle with the controls, and we'll get somewhere!Hey Cloud? Why don't you try piloting it?They say you don't get motion sickness if you're driving.
You can do it, Cloud!
No. 2......I saw that written at the dock! They must mean this sub.
Aye, aye... CAPTAIN!
But how? We're at the bottom of the sea!!
Just in time!Come on! Let's go to the airport!
There should only be a few guards now.It might be safe to go to the submarine dock under Junon.
Can't we go after it?
Where are they headed?
How are you feeling?You ought to rest a bit... Don't push yourself.
Can't we do something? If it goes on, we're......
Hey, what about the Huge Materia?
...I can't! It's so heavy, I can't lift it...
Don't worry! Think!
Cid... that's beautiful.
The planet's scream...... or Meteor...? Is it this planet?
Did you forget?Bugenhagen told us.
Did Bugenhagen...... tell you anything?
Cid! What did you do!?
Hey, Cloud. Let me ride once in a while.
Hey, Cloud. Let me ride once in a while.
My head feels like it's getting crushed.
...no good. Cloud, let's have the others come.
That reminds me... I was the same.
But Aeris is gone.
I wonder what Aeris felt... when she was on that altar...?
Really? I wonder? I don't think that's it at all.I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she planned on coming back all along.She always used to talk about the 'Next time'.She talked about the future more than any of us...Although she never talked about it to us she must've had a rough life...I think Aeris looked forward to tomorrow and the future more than anyone......she must've had many many dreams......
Cloud......
You mean, WE...
What Aeris left us... We can't waste it.
Cait Sith...... Barret, he knows what he did.What we did in Midgar can't be forgotten no matter what the reason.
Whether you love it or hate it...You just can't bring yourself to leave Midgar, can you?
What's wrong? Are you still looking for something...?
Let's go to the Airship!
Which direction is it going to attack from?
Now we're going to fight Sephiroth.I wonder what the inside of that cave looks like? You think Sephiroth is just sitting there waiting for Meteor?
It's all right.You're here... Everyone's all togetherTogether... we can do anything. We've worked this hard already.
Looks like all transportation from the slums is cut off......
We sure got to know the Midgar underground.
I'm all right! Hurry and go to the cannon!
This can't be...
I can't believe Sephiroth is Hojo's son...
Did you forget?I'm... all alone. I don't have anywhere to go.
Everyone's gone...
You're right...But... I'm sure someday... they'll come back, don't you think?
Hmm... But that's all right, even if no one comes back.As long as I'm with you... As long as you're by my side... I won't give up even if I'm scared.
No matter how close we are... We were far apart... before this.But when we were in the Lifestream surrounded by all those screams of anguish, I thought I heard your voice......sniff... you probably don't remember this...But deep in my heart I heard you calling my name... Or at least I thought I did...
Cloud...? Do you think the stars can hear us?Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?
Yeah...... that's right...
Cloud... Words aren't the only thing that tell people what you're thinking...
H, huh...?
Umm... G, good morning... Cloud.Give me a little longer... Just a little bit longer...
Cloud...? Do you think the stars can hear us?Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?
Yeah...... that's right...
Umm. Yes, I guess you're right......
H, huh...?
Mmm...... Good morning, Cloud.Give me a little longer... Just a little big longer...
.........
But, I still...!?
Yes... That's right!
The airship is too big for just the two of us.Yeah, it's a little lonely without everyone.
Huh!?
Why didn't you tell me!?
......Were you listening?
I have the sheet music for that song.Huh? Wait a minute! There's something inside the music sheet.
Hey, Cloud... Would you tell me 'It's all right'?
Now I feel like things are really going to be all right.Thanks, Cloud.I'm all right. I'm not going to chicken out at the last minute.
You're right, things will be all right.I'm... all right... really... I'll fight my hardest...
I'm sorry... I guess you're right.......Wow. I guess... I am a little scared. My knees are trembling.
Then I'm going...
Let's all go back alive, okay?
Cloud which way should we go?
Then I'll go...
After this, we can go home. All of us...
Hey, were you thinking of leaving me?
Cloud, look.
By the way Yuffie didn't you find something?
This is it.
Is this like a practice run before the real thing?
We'll meet up later.
What!?
Owwww......
Cloud...... Cloud... So we did end up together...
Cloud... Cloud...
Cloud...?
Holy...... Aeris......
...We're not gonna lose!!Aeris is here... everyone is here... Cloud is here with us!There's still many things for us to do... I'm not giving up!!
...You're right.We've done all that we could do.
What happened?
What......
Cloud!?
Cloud!
What?
Yeah, let's go meet her.
(waving)I'm glad you're all safe!
What's that!?
