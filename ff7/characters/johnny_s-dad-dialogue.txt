Ha! Ha!...... I wonder if my son's already left?When it's just my wife and I here, you have no idea how lonesome it gets.You want them to be happy and do what they want while they're young, but being a parent, you can't help but worry...I guess I'm not cut out to be a parent yet.By the way......Where are you from?
Hm...... you said Nibelheim? Wasn't it in the news a while back?Something to do with a Reactor accident...That was the first major Mako accident, so I remember it really being a hot topic.
Ha, Ha!...... Well, there's nothin' wrong with that, I'd say.But if you still have a family, You outta at least write them.Even though you may turn your back on your hometown, It'll always be there for you.Least that's how I see it.
Well, you mind leaving the two of us alone?I want to enjoy some quiet time together with my wife.
