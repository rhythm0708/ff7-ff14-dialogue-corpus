Camera's ready!Then, Ifalna, please tell us about the Cetra.
Tell us Ifalna... Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?
Ifalna, what exactly does Planet-reading entail?
Do the Ancients, rather, the Cetra, have special powers to heal the Planet?
Hmm, even here so close to the North Cave, the snow never melts.Is that because the planet's energy is gathered here to heal its injury?
Ifalna... Let's take a break.
Who is the person that appeared at the North Cave? I haven't any idea.
You don't look well... Let's call it a day.
Ifalna, can you comment on the thing called 'Weapon'?
Back then, Weapon was a weapon the Planet produced of it's own will?
So, Weapon no longer exists on this Planet?
Where is Weapon?
...Thank you, Ifalna, that will be all for today...
Oh, I'm thinking of taping it on video. But, the video's not working right...
No, that's not it. I'm going to record my beautiful daughter.And when she's sleeping, her face... looks like an angel.
I've already decided! If it's a girl, then it'll be Aeris. That's that!
Right!? Oh, the video tape......
.........Please don't say it that way.It's our lovely daughter, both yours... and mine!Don't you want to capture her childhood on videotape?
Never say that! I will protect you and Aeris no matter what!!You and Aeris are my only treasures. I'll never let you go!!
Who could that--I was just about to...Damn!!How dare they intrude on our 'private time' together!
Hojo... How did you know?
...New sample? You don't mean Aeris!?
That's it! I'm severing all ties with the Shinra.Hojo, please leave.
Ifalna!
Don't worry, Ifalna. I'll take care of this!
Ifalna! Take Aeris and run!!
