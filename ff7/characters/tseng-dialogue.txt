That's right. You'll have a hard time disarming that one.It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it.
Ha ha ha......Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate Release System.
I wouldn't try that...... You just might make me injure our special guest.
Oh, you know each other?How nice you could see each other one last time. You should thank me.
I haven't decided.Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient.It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to the President.
Ha, ha, ha... Well, it should be starting right about now. Think you can escape in time?
We want you to return Aeris to us. We've been searching for her for a long time.
Aeris, you're a very special child. You are of special blood.Your real mother was an 'Ancient'.
The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness.Aeris will be able to bring happiness to all those in the slums.That is why the Shinra would like Aeris's cooperation......
But Aeris, surely you hear voices sometimes when you're all alone?
It must have been a real thrill for you... Did you enjoy it?
...Elena. You talk too much.
No need to tell them about our orders.
I thought I gave you other orders.Now go. Don't forget to file your report.
...Elena. You don't seem to understand.
...Go. Don't let Sephiroth get away.
Well, then...
Aeris... Long time no see.Looks like you got away from the Shinra for a while, now that Sephiroth reappeared.
No...Well, I won't be seeing too much of you, so take care.
Well then, stay out of Shinra's way.
...Where's Aeris? She's not with you?
Oh... Then give her my regards.
Stay outta this.
...No I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away.
I just can't wait.
I envy them.
......
......
Well done.
Uh... I've been had.It's not the Promised Land... Sephiroth's searching for...
Look... for yourself...
...pretty harsh. Sounds like something... you'd say.
I am...... still alive...
...I wonder. Anyway, we have to report to the President.
Yeah...Hey Elena, how 'bout dinner after this job's over?
Is this the Promised Land? No, it can't be...
Sephiroth!!
This place... what is it?
One with the Planet?
...you can do that?
