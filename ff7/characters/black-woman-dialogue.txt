Grandpa used to be a Coal Train engineer.He still can't kick his old habits from then.
As long as we're here, Grandpa's not going to be able to forget about trains.Maybe we'll start anew, moving to Southern Isle of Mideel.
With Meteor coming, I guess it won't make any difference...
Seeing that train got Grandpa more excited than I've seen him for some time.
