I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?The new President's probably the same.He's just gonna order us around anyway.
You're stowaways, right?It's okay. I'm used to them.The truth is, before I worked here, I was one of the best.Costa del Sol... a harbor paradise where the sun always shines and it's summer all year round!Hmm...... Things aren't going well...... You can go sightseeing in the city.
Yes, sir!!
Ready for departure, sir!!
Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear.Oops! You must be those AVALANCHE guys!Quick! Let's get outta here! Heidegger's in charge of the transport ship.That's tough for both of us.The transport ship won't be sailing for quite a while. Heidegger's orders.
How 'bout a ship taxi? Only in Junon!Free to Air Force personnel!
Roger!! Hey! Taxi!!
Just holler whenever you want a ride!If you get sick easily, maybe you'd better not go.
Thinking of being stowaways?It's 100 gil to Junon. Give it to me, and I'll put in a good word with the captain.What'll we do?
Okay. Come on. This way.It's not the most pleasant ride but make the best of it.
Thank you. Come back any time you want to stowaway on our ship.
Preparations complete!
Everyday there's no ship coming in, I always come here to watch the sun go down.The sun disappears almost like it's swallowed up in the big horizon.And somewhere out there is a big unknown continent with another port city.Twilight always gets me misty...I'm so glad I became a seaman.Well... I wouldn't have time for one now anyway because of that Weapon thing...I haven't had a girl friend in 18 years. And I'm a romantic! ......phew.
There's no ship to Junon. Recently, there's been a hoard on materials. Everything's topsy-turvy.
