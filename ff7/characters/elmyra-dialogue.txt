Bodyguard......? You mean you were followed again!?Are you all right!? You're not hurt, are you!?
Thank you, Cloud.
But dear... I give up. You never listen once you've made up your mind.But if you must go, why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late now.
Aeris, please go and make the bed.
That glow in your eyes... you're from SOLDIER, right?
......I don't know how to say this, but...Would you please leave here, tonight? Without telling Aeris.SOLDIER... the last thing Aeris needs is to get her feelings hurt again...
Cloud...... wasn't it?It's about Aeris, isn't it?
I know. They took her from here.
That's what Aeris wanted...
Aeris is an Ancient. The sole survivor.
...Not her real mother. Oh... it must have been 15 years ago......during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far away place called Wutai.
I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the sky,But she said it was this planet... She was a mysterious child in many ways.
The Shinra needed her, So I guess they wouldn't harm her.
She brought a little girl here with her.On the way here, Tseng found them. She probably couldn't get away fast enough.She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little girl's safety.
You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a child alone like that!?
...I think I understand what you're saying... She's upstairs asleep, Why don't you go and see her.
Don't say that. Aeris doesn't think that.
...sigh...
Yes, I don't mind.
...You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
I mean it, come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
