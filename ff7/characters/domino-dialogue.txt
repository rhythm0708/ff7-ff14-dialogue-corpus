Hmm? Oh, and who might you be?You all must be those... ahem... Me? I'm , the Mayor of Midgar.Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it is really run by Shinra, Inc.My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents...Me! The Mayor! A librarian! Ohh......You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the password, I'll give you my keycard.Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my keycard!Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item!
Got it?Then tell me.So, what's the password?
BEST!!God, I love the sound of that! BEST!! I AM the best... ME!! No matter what anyone else says, you'd better believe it.KING!!God, I love the sound of that! KING!! President Shinra sucks! I should be King of Midgar!BOMB!!God, I love the sound of that! BOMB!! I'm so angry, I'm like a walking time bomb waiting to explode!MAKO!!God, I love the sound of that! MAKO! If I had a lot more of it, I would be a real Mayor!
......hmm. Well, ok. Here, take it.
I never thought you'd get it on the first try...Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Oh well, a promise is a promise. Take this, too.
Nope! You're ALL wrong! It's a much better word than that! Try again!
......hmm. Well, ok. Here, take it.Hmm. It appears you're not completely stupid.Fine then, take this.
Why would I do something like this, you ask?To mess with them, of course! Shinra's been torturing me forever.That's why I was a little rough on you all just now. Now go up there and really make them suffer.This ought to make us even! Heh heh heh......But my card will only get you to the 65th floor.Can you believe how they treat me? ...ME! Like some common employee...
