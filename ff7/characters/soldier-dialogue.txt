Hey! You there!!
That's as far as you go.
Enough babbling...... Grab him!!
......Hey sis, this one's a little weird.
Reno! Want him taken out?
I'm all right.
Psst... (You keep wandering around here and you'll get in trouble.)
Man... I'm so nervous.
Look, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?
...That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero...
Hey, if you don't calm down, you won't get a good evaluation...
(inside the room)We're short one bed...
I was so nervous. I couldn't get any sleep...
Let's hurry.
There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this room...
Sephiroth seems different.
(lying near Cloud's house)...Sephi... roth
Then! I'll sing along with you!Quietly--!!Aaaaah!Aaaaah!Hey, come on now.
Rufus has arrived! Preparation completed!
Begin the Welcome Parade!
Captain!! We'll take a short cut!
I'll go first! Now you watch close and do as I do, rookie!Just sneak into the back of the line when you see an opening.
Commander!! What's today's special pose?
Hmm? A know-it-all, huh?All right!! Come in!!
This is a Respectable Inn... guests only!You should absorb all the wisdom until it is a part of you.
Hey! Aren't you still on duty!?Look, I'm in no position to talk, but...Don't become a delinquent worker like me.
President Rufus... has now arrived!
Hey, get to work!Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship!If we do good, we could get promoted!
...the Engine Room... ...a suspicious...... character...No...... there's no way...... that...... not a human...... That thing's not human...............
Attention! Dismissed!!
All I wanted was to become a pilot! It used to leave me speechless watching the Highwind in the sunset!
Ever since I was late to that parade, they've been on my back everyday with basic training.I can't handle it anymore!
Only authorized personnel are allowed past this point!You know too, right? About Junon Navy's important classified information.A new submarine has almost been completed using Shinra's top technology.A new version of submarine. I'll be sailing on it. Man, I can't wait!
I'm a good lookin' man once I take my uniform off.
These barracks are for soldiers. This is no place for civilians.
Just you... and me!!
What? Yeah......
Ele... Elena!?
Don't be angry. I'm just doing my job.
Stop it, there're kids around!Listen, I probably shouldn't tell you, but I hear something big's going down up North.The President's gonna be there. So, would you please just lay low for a while?
It's kinda lonely at the airport without the Highwind, isn't it?I miss that bikini girl on the side of the plane.
I'm starting to feel like I can't stop anymore.
I've been had!! I want to get in a real battle, too!
(trying to cross his legs casually)I'm learning to be a delinquent soldier!!I just can't seem to get the hang of it! It just isn't going right!!
You guys are...!
Mom... Tifa...... my town... give it back...I had so much respect for you... I admired you...
After they get it, they'll take it to the airport and will transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down!
How 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out?
Whoa!! Don't even talk about that!
Eyaaarrrgh!Captain... I can't hold on any longer!Eyaaarrrgh!
P... Please!! Spare me!!
Captain... I can't hold on any longer!Eyaaarrrgh!
Whew... I hope everything goes all right until we get to Rocket Town. Then, our mission is nearly complete.
The stuff...
Heee, ...... The Shinra have occupied this shop!
The Shinra Army's gathered at Midgar. Now it's just a matter of time Sephiroth's dead.What... me? I don't mind. I'll just wait here. My life is important to me.
