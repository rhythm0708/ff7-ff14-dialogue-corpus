Oh...... a jack of all trades.
Sorry...... I just
Say, Cloud. Have you ever been a bodyguard?You DO do everything, right?
Then, get me out of here. Take me home.
Well then, let's see......How about if I go out with you once?
Don't fight here! You'll ruin the flowers!
Cloud... that one!
What should we do?
Right. Make sure they don't get through!
Eaygh!!
Cloud, help!
A, all right.
Thanks, Cloud.
Oh, Cloud what are you doing!?
A, all right.
A, all right.
Ha, ha...... They're looking for me again.
...no.
Hmmm......
This violently? I thought they were kidnapping someone.
They look like it.
No, not really. I think they believe I have what it takes to be in SOLDIER!
I don't know... But I don't want to get caught by THOSE people!
Wait... Wait, I said!
Puff... wheeze...Slow...... down... Don't leave me......
Oh! You're terrible!
Hey...... Cloud. Were you... ever in SOLDIER?
...Your eyes. They have a strange glow...
......Oh, nothing.
Right, nothing!Come on, let's go! Bodyguard!
Whew! Finally made it off! Now what...
This guy are sick.He passed out nearby and someone must have helped him here.
This is the one...... Won't you help him?
No... I guess not...Hey... that man has a tattoo. I think it was the number 2.
I'm home, mom.This is Cloud. My bodyguard.
I'm all right. I had Cloud with me.
So what are you going to do now?
Is Tifa...... a girl?
A girl...friend?
Hee hee hee......You don't have to get THAT upset...
Oh, how nice.
Well, that's... nice.Let's see, Sector 7? I'll show you the way.
I'm used to it.
A girl!! What do you mean by that!?You expect me to just sit by and listen, after hearing you say something like that!?Mom! I'm taking Cloud to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while.
Yeah, you're right, mom.
You need to go through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. Sector 6 is a littledangerous so you'd better get some rest tonight.Cloud...Good night.
Cloud! I thought the Turks came back! Get some rest!
You're up bright and early.
Are you done?
You have to go through the slum in Sector 6 to get to Tifa's 7th Heaven.I'll take you there. Come on!
The gate to Sector 7's in there.
Oh no! 'What ever will I do!?' ...isn't that what you want me to say?
Isn't that a little out of the way?
I could do that. But won't I be in your way?
Nothing!
Can we take a break?
What rank were you?
You know, in SOLDIER.
Just the same as him.
My first boyfriend.
No. But I liked him for a while.
It doesn't really matter.
That girl in the cart was Tifa? Where was she going? She looked kind of odd...
This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So we've got to find Tifa fast.
Hey, this look's like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look.I'll tell Tifa about you.
Why?
Then what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?
Cloud, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way.
Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring.
You ARE worried about Tifa, aren't you? Then come on, hurry!
.........Hmmmmmmm. So that's how you fooled them.
Hey!! Cloud!!
Excuse me! I'd like to get a dress.
What's the problem?
And, where is your father?
So... You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something about your father?
Well, if we don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?
All right, we'll do something. Let's go, Cloud!
Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?
I didn't say that......
Cloud, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and talk to him.Why don't you go over there and have something to drink.
You know, Mister.He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up like a girl.So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him...
So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?
Then you'll do it for us?
Something...- That feels clean- That feels softAnd something...- shiny- that shimmers
It's still not right. A wig! That's what you need!
Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!
Right.And about the wig...
THE beautiful Bro?
Why......?
(turning away)Gosh!
Finished?
Finished?
Geez.
Geez.
Geez.
Aren't you going to change?
Walk more nicely like... this. Miss Cloud.
Oh you're so cute, Miss Cloud.Aaah, I want one. Do you have one that'll look good on me too?
...I want THIS one.
I'm going to go change.
So? How do I look?
Oh, you're no fun!
...What is it? Are you going outside like that? I mean, that's okay with me, but...
Get a hold of yourself, Ms. Cloud.
Now's our chance. Let's find Tifa.I wonder where she is...
...Tifa?Nice to meet you. I'm .Cloud's told me a lot about you.
Right, with Cloud.
Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing.
Poor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call him nothing.Right, Cloud?
Embarrassed? Come on, speak up!
Ahem!! I'll just plug my ears.
Hey, what's the secret?
Sorry... but I overheard...If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?
We have two here, right?
Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?
I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger.Do you trust me?
Call me .
...to ask.
They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.
No---!!
I'm so sorry!!
I told you. I'm used to danger.To tell you the truth, my heart was pounding!
Ye... yes, you're right... ......let's hurry!
Don, you've got great taste.
Ye...yes...But Mr. Don. I'd like you to explain something to me first...
No, that's not what I meant!NO, STOP! Just, just wait a second!!
Cloud!!
I'm sorry, Don.
...I'll rip them off.
Yeah.
Well, the worst is over...
Maybe not...
Don't give up, never give up hope. It's not easy to destroy the pillar, right?
Don't tell me to go home.
......gun fire?
Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe.
(crouching next to Wedge)Don't worry. You let me handle this.
(leaning forward)Tifa, don't worry! She's all right!
Hurry and get out!
Mom.Please don't cry.
Someone dear to you has just died.His spirit was coming to see you, but he already returned to the planet.
No! Never!
He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!
No, I don't!
Cloud, help!
Thanks, Cloud.
Cloud... so you did come for me.
I'll see you later!! We'll be waiting at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Not that way! Everyone's on the 66th Floor Elevator.
Cloud, are you there?
Yeah, I'm all right.I knew that Cloud would come for me.
The deal was for one date, right?
...!? Tifa! Tifa, you're there too!
What?
...I don't know.All I know is...The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and unlock the Planet.And...... then...The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises supreme happiness.
More than words...... I don't know.
It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what they are saying.
I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said that Midgar was no longer safe. That is... my real mother.Someday I'll get out of Midgar... Speak with the Planet and find my Promised Land....That's what mom said.I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but...
Must've been attacked by...
I've heard that no one's ever seen him bleed or cry.
...a flower girl from the slums.
Cloud... I just thought of something.
Hmm, it's going to get pretty ugly from here on. We should check on our equipment.
Quickly! We'll escape out this way......Quickly, we can escape this way...Quickly, we have to get out of here...
You all get out while you can.It's not you they're after... it's me.
...thank you, Mr. Barret!
I'll go too. ...I have things that I want to find out.
......Many things.
You know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar...
A little, ...no, maybe a lot. But I have my bodyguard, right?
I thought you'd say that!
She said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. ...Maybe it's for the best.
Stop it, Cloud! I'm worried too.
It would have to be Cloud.
...Unexpected
Cloud! Are you lost!?
We've reached Kalm.
I wonder if everyone's there already. Let's hurry over to the inn!
Well then, I'll go on ahead.
Cloud, you're late!
Guess everyone's here now.
...one day?
So... Where do you come in?
It's a reunion of childhood pals!
Me too! It's been a long time, right?
That's all right, Cloud.
Tifa... You were waiting outside then?
What happened to Sephiroth?
Shinra, Inc. owns the paper, so you can't rely on that information.
Seems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? It was in the Shinra building, right?
Did someone else carry it out after that? It was missing from the Shinra building.
I...The Ancients...... Cetra...... Jenova...... Sephiroth and myself......
Cloud. Take this.
With [PHS], I can see you any time!
Well, I'll be going.
Our enemy is someone that could do this...?
By any chance, are you...?
...so what are you saying? That I should be grateful to Sephiroth?
...strange, hearing that from you.
Who is that girl...?
Hmm... Hey, don't we have less money than what we had?
Geez!! You shouldn't do this!!
Hmm... Hey, don't we have less money than what we had?
Geez!! You shouldn't do this!!
She's gone... So what was that all about?
Hmm... Hey, don't we have less money than what we had?
Geez!! You shouldn't do this!!
She's gone... So what was that all about?
Hmm... Hey, don't we have less money than what we had?
Geez!! You shouldn't do this!!
What do you mean, "a battlefield"?
After all, we came all this way, Cloud.
A huge bird.
Why?
We must protect the condor eggs, right?
Cloud, why are you still worrying about it?
Yes, yes. Let's do our best.
What a jerk. I'm disappointed in you.
Let's rest. Okay?
No you're wrong! We have nothing to do with the Shinra.
What's that!?
Cloud, hurry!
Want to rest?
I heard that girl regained consciousness.
You think Rufus is thinking about crossing the ocean from here, too?What? Does that mean Sephiroth already crossed the ocean?
Yeah, better leave it to Cloud!
You're probably right.
Umm...... It's me .Hey, Cloud. Did you see the Airship at Junon?
That was REALLY something.Hey, do you think I could get on it?
Wow! I'm really looking forward to it!Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me!
...Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it.Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship.
Hey, Cloud. Did you see Barret?I hope he's not doing anything stupid...
Huh?
Is it really Sephiroth......?
Look, Cloud!!
I've seen this before...
Jenova... With this thing?
The time is now... I think that was what was said.
Hmm... I don't get it.Hey, Cloud. Can you explain it to us?
Maybe we shouldn't stay in here anymore...
Oh, too bad. I liked Barret's sailor suit.He looked so cute.
Maybe I should get a tan for a change.Which do you like, Cloud?
(she says the same thing regardless)Got it. I'll remember that.
Sounds good to me!Hmm? Cloud, are you thinking of anything in particular?Your cool exterior's cracking...Well then, let's go!
Oh! Cloud!!
I have a bad feeling about this.
Cloud, don't. If he dies, we won't find out anything!
I'm . The least you can do is remember my name.I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo...I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me.
You didn't know!? She died.
Professor Hojo...Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have the same blood?
He's mumbling slowly... That must mean he's hiding something!
Whew... I don't know why I'm so tired.There's so many things I don't understand......I feel a little uneasy.Cloud...?What do you think of me?
......You're right.Even I don't understand myself.I wonder what part of me is like an Ancient?What is an Ancient supposed to be like? It's strange, isn't it?I don't understand it......Ahh...... I'm going around in circles. I wonder if there's any answer to this. Everything's so complicated.I'm going on to bed.
How could you say such a thing! Sometimes you make me so mad!Oh, I never should have brought this up!!I don't want to talk about it!
There was a black-cloaked guy here, too?
Cloud!!I was just wishing you were here!Unless someone lets down the bridge, we're stuck.Cloud should be able to do something.But let's take a breather first.
Come on, Cloud. Let's rest a minute.
I'm sure glad I'm with you, Cloud!
Oh, Cloud!! Good Luck!!
How cute!!
Cloud......
Cloud......
Barret, what happened?
But how could those people say those terrible things?
.........
Everything Shinra does seem to make everyone miserable...
Wow! Let's have fun!I know this isn't the right time to do this.
Really? That's too bad.
...whisper... whisper... (Just act normal when this happens)
Of course!
...I think he's mad.
I wish we could just forget everything and have fun!
Cloud!Don't go alone, go with me!
What happened?
Wow, how nice.Oh! Look, Cloud.It's so pretty.Cloud!Wow!
What?
What are you talking about?
What are we going to do, Cloud?
Are you thinking of just us going back?
What!? Why?
Cloud!? Where are you going?
It can't be!?
You all right?
Hey!! Barret!!
Cloud, what should we do? Barret's not his normal self.
Hey that's Cloud's line! '...It's too dangerous, I can't let you get involved...' blah, blah, blah...
We saw you and hurried here. Barret, just tell us what's going on.
But... Dyne's injury was the same as yours, right?
Barret, this isn't the end.
That's easier to understand. It's you, Barret.
I wonder if Dyne will join us?
Yes, good luck, Cloud.
Cloud, isn't this great!? The assistant manager just stopped by and dropped off a 'buggy' for you!Now you can go over 'deserts' and 'rivers' no problem.OK, Cloud. I'll be waiting outside.
...How could they know we were coming here.
That there's a Shinra spy...
Zack...
That can't...
Zack...
That can't...
What a shock... I didn't know Zack was from this town.
Didn't I tell you? He was my first love.
Zack... SOLDIER First Class. Same as Cloud.
That's all right. It's all in the past now. I was just worried because I heard he's been missing.
I think it was 5 years ago. He went out on a job, and never came back.He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone else...Hey? What's wrong?
I don't really mind that I haven't heard from him. But I feel for his parents.
Are you... jealous? Hmm? Hmmm? Are you, Cloud?
I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
Let's go, Cloud.
Cosmo... Canyon? I wonder if there's any relation to the planet or the Ancients...
Let's rest for a bit. There are some things I want to find out about anyway.
Maybe there are some people here that know about the Promised Land and the Ancients.
Hmm?
So pretty... It's just like the real thing!
Hey! A shooting star!
Wow, how wonderful.
I learned a lot. The elders taught me many things.About the Cetra... And the Promised Land...I'm...... alone... I'm all alone now...
I know. I know, but... I am the only...... Cetra.
......
I wonder what he wants to show Nanaki...?
So this is it, Nanaki...
...somthing's strange?
This is Nibelheim, right? But the town's all here.
Hey, what's going on?
You'll dream about bad things if you sleep in a place like THIS.
That's dirty!
So your punishment was to sleep? That's... kinda weird.
Sure is a quick change of heart. Huh?
Let's take it? OK, Cloud!
I'm .
Sheesh...!! What bad manners!
Is it like this all the time? You keep quiet even when he's like that to you?
It won't stop!
I'm all for it.
What!? What happened, all of a sudden?
......Hmmm...... Something's fishy...You're not planning something sneaky again, are you?
Hey, the Shinra......!?
Yuffie, did you by any chance...
This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'?So you WERE up to something bad!
What's going on!?I thought something was missing... my materia's all gone!!
Hey... where's Yuffie...?
I'm so------ mad!!She was probably eyeing our materia from the beginning.Seems like she headed North. Let's hurry after her and get our materia back!
I don't think she came out from here... Is that ok?
I feel bad, but......
Eyaaaaah
Wait, don't leave us!
You just don't get it, do you...!?
All right...
Thanks for your help.
All right. We'll take your daughter with us.
Let's make this quick.
The Cetras return to the Promised Land. A land that promises boundless happiness.
That's what the Ancients call themselves.Hey, didn't you listen to the elders at Cosmo Canyon?
...You don't 'know' where the Promised Land of the Ancients is.You search and travel, until you feel it. Like you just know, '...this is the Promised Land.'
I think so.
That, and one other thing he's searching for.
...You know......I think Hojo did something to those men in the Black Capes.But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though...That's why I think we should just go after Sephiroth himself.
And...I'm sorry, forget it!I think I'm tired. I'm going to bed now.
Hee, hee!
You want to go on a date?
A DA-TE! Or haven't you ever gone on one?
Hey...a little touchy, aren't we?
No, just a mixed-up kid...
Oh well, come on let's go...
Come on, let's go.
This sounds like fun. Come on Cloud, let's do it.
Please help me...Legendary hero!psst...... like that?
Cloud... I mean, Alfred...
Wh, what is this?You can't do this!
Stop it Cloud! What are you doing!?The play's a disaster! Now I'm getting mad!
Why don't you shut up, Blabbermouth!!
Please help me...Legendary hero!psst...... like that?
Wh, what is this?You can't do this!
Stop it Cloud! What are you doing!?The play's a disaster! Now I'm getting mad!
Why don't you shut up, Blabbermouth!!
Stop it Cloud! What are you doing!?The play's a disaster! Now I'm getting mad!
Why don't you shut up, Blabbermouth!!
Please help me...Legendary hero!psst...... like that?
Cloud... I mean, Alfred...
Wh, what is this?You can't do this!
Wh, what is this?You can't do this!
Please help me...Legendary hero!psst...... like that?
Wh, what is this?You can't do this!

Why don't you shut up, Blabbermouth!!
Stop it Cloud! What are you doing!?The play's a disaster! Now I'm getting mad!
Why don't you shut up, Blabbermouth!!
Oh, that was fun. Hey, let's go on the Gondola.
Two, please.
Wow, how nice.Oh! Look, Cloud.It's so pretty.
I want to meet you.
(I know, I know...what I mean is...)I want to meet...you.
I had fun tonight. Let's go together again.You don't like being with me?
Oh, don't tease like that!Oh, look at the time. We'd better get going.
I'm glad.Next time let's take our time and go on more rides.
Hey? What's Cait Sith doing?
We've got no time for this! Let's go after Cait Sith!
We don't have time for this! We've got to go after Cait Sith.
There's no time for this! We have to go after Cait Sith.
We don't have time for that!? Let's hurry and go after Cait Sith!
There's no time for that!! Let's hurry and go after Cait Sith!
There's no time for this, right!? Let's hurry after Cait Sith!
...I trusted you. I can't believe you!
So you're from Shinra. Who? Who are you! Tell me!
......And so on, and so on...
Hey! That's Marlene!
I wonder if Marlene is all right... I wonder what happened to Mom.
I want to go! I'm going for sure!
This is... the Temple of the Ancients...I... I know... I feel it... The knowledge of the Ancients... floating...You could become one with the Planet, but you're stopping it with the strength of will.For the future? For us?
You're uneasy... But happy?Because I'm here? I'm sorry... I don't understand.
Look......
Hey! It's Tseng!
You're wrong.The Promised Land isn't like what you imagined.And, I'm not going to help.Either way, there was no way Shinra could have won.
...Tseng's with our enemy, the Turks, but I've known him since we were little...There's not a lot of people I can say that about. In fact, there are probably only a handful of people in the world who really know me.
Words... feelings... So many of them here.
...Cloud! I know it's going to be tough, but...Don't give up! We can do it!
Whew! We finally caught up to you.I'm sorry. You waited for me.Those are the spirit bodies of the Ancients.They've been away from their Planet for a long time to protect this Temple.Over the many years, they've lost the ability to talk.Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because there was only one objective for those left in the Temple.Please, talk to me!No good. I don't understand the rest. Are you afraid...?Is it because Sephiroth is in the Temple? Or something else?
Phew--- We did it!
Oh no... Cloud. Come quick!!Hurry, this way!
It's full of the knowledge of the Ancients.No... not knowledge... consciousness... a living soul...It's trying to say something.I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Wait! Look! It's showing us!
Did you see it?
Almost there...
This atmosphere...
Hey! It's locked.No good. We have to catch it!You must be tired.
Just hang in there. Someday we'll look back at these hard times and laugh.
Yeah. But it'll all be over soon!
This is the room with the murals...
How do you intend to become one with the Planet?
An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?Injure... the Planet?
Wait, Cloud!
Cloud!!
Cloud!! Get a hold of yourself!
...Cloud.
...It's nothing so don't worry about it.Right, Cloud! It's nothing.
Sephiroth got away.
...this must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying.The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor.It finds small drifting planets with its magic.And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out entirely...
He disappeared.
...There's something written on it....B.l.a.c.k...... M.a.t.e.r.i.a.
Hey!...Black Materia.What should we do, Cloud?
Wait a minute. I'll ask!
So, this whole building is the Black Materia?
Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple.And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve a puzzle.As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too.Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
Yes, but there's one thing...You can only answer the puzzles inside the Temple.So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple.
So what are we going to do?
Cloud...... behind you.
Cait Sith...Come on, Cloud... Say something.
Why don't you read our fortunes?
Hmm, let's see how compatible Cloud and I are!
No! Tell me!I promise I won't get mad!
Be strong Cait Sith!!
Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power to use it.
That's right.One person's power alone won't do it.Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's energy...Oh yeah!The Promised Land!!
Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient.
I won't let you do it! The future is not only yours!
Cloud, are you all right?
Cloud... be strong, OK?
Cloud... you haven't done anything.It's not your fault.
Cloud, can you hear me?
Don't worry about it.
Oh...Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it?And let me handle Sephiroth.
This forest leads to the City of the Ancients... and is called the Sleeping Forest.It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor.That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the Cetra, like me, can do it.
