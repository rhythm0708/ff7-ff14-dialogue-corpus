I'll secure the escape passage. Concentrate on the mission, Cloud.Geez, we're really gonna blow this huge furnace up? This'll be somethin' to see!
Yeah.
Cloud never came.
Hey, Barret! What about our money...?
Cloud!!
Hey, Cloud!! You were great back there!
Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous... and me, too!Cloud!!Don't ya think I got a bright future ahead of me?
All my life, I felt like nothin' but a sidekick.But after joinin' AVALANCHE and tryin' to save the Planet, I feel like I can do lots of things.
Oh man, that's pretty harsh, Cloud. You really think I won't?
I'm seein' stars. This sucks. I hate the dark.
Oh, Cloud!Tifa really knows how to cook. Mmm, mmm......Anyway, let me tell you somethin'
Tifa always lets me taste her cooking.And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly.Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good food and drinks that make this shop famous.
Cloud...... ......forget it.
You think I'm a little too uptight?
The next mission will be to blow up the Sector 5 Reactor.Cloud, you're great! Don't you ever get nervous?Or are you like, impervious to feelings? Naw, that couldn't be it.
Well, that's ok. Don't worry about me. I don't look like it, but I'm a coward at heart.
......Cloud.You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me.Cloud... You just want friends.Isn't that right?
Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me.If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can always talk to me.
You're terrible. Real cold blooded.
They're gonna lock the door, sir!
Guess who? It's me, !Looks like things were a success.I look just like my little brother in these clothes...I wonder how everyone's doin' now...?
Cloud, this way. The reactor's up this ladder.
......Cloud...... You remembered...... my name.Barret's up top. ...help him......An' Cloud... Sorry, I wasn't any help.
