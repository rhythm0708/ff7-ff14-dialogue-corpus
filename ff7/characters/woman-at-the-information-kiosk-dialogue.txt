Say, aren't you bored?
Oh, really? I'm a little bored.Come on, back to work now!
Isn't that good? You're just expecting too much.
Here you are! The Costa del Sol tourist information guide.What do you want to know?
Let's see. I recommend a resort located on the outskirts of the city.
If you're looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's.
Wait a minute. I'm going to look at my guidebook.It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West. And has a prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages.Come on! I don't care about that!If you want a good time, come to the beach! There are lots of beautiful women.You wouldn't happen to be... rich?
You're kidding! You can't tell just by looking.But I'll tell you just in case.After relaxing at Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a rich and exciting place to play!Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park.But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it.But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once.
I thought so.Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer.Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park.But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it.But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once.
I don't feel like sightseeing around town. What I really want to do is... Looks like Gold Saucer is temporarily closed.
