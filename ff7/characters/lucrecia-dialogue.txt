Vincent......?
Stay back!!
I wanted to disappear... I couldn't be with anyone... I wanted to die...But the Jenova inside me wouldn't let me die...Lately, I dream a lot of Sephiroth... My dear, dear child.Ever since he was born I never got to hold him, even once...Not even once. You can't call me his mother... That... is my sin...
Back!! Stay back!Vincent... Won't you please tell me?
If Sephiroth is still alive?I heard that he died five years ago. But I see him in my dreams so often...And I know that physically, like myself, he can't die so easily.Please, Vincent tell me......
