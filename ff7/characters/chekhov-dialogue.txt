Hm, so someone finally got past Gorky.
So, I guess it's time for  to stand in...
You can't go to the next floor unless you beat Shake.
Ho, ho, ho... It's been a while since I felt pain...
That being the case, we have nothing further to discuss.
How dare they mock us like that, thinking they could sneak past us.
Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes. Staniv, you watch over there.
Keep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to get burned.
Ho, ho, ho. We'll see if you still talk like that after you taste some of my Sacred Magic...Magic Change!
Ho, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of diapers!?
Ho, ho, ho! What does a immature young child know...?
I can't believe you beat me...
Managing that girl must be exceedingly rough on you.
Of course. If WE lost to her...
...
...What do you want to say?
Lord Godo!
Fight so that you never bring shame on Wutai.
