Huh? Oh another customer. You sure picked an out of the way place but...But if it's the "Keystone" you're looking for, you're too late. Don't have it.
What? You didn't come here for that?The "Keystone" is the key that unlocks the gate to a very old temple somewhere.You're not going to believe your ears,But I heard it was the Temple of the Ancients!!
Kya, hah hah hah...Don't take it seriously. It's just a legend!Huh? What?
I sold it already. Yeah well, to tell the truth, I didn't really want to sell it but...That guy had a way about him that made you feel like it may not be a good idea NOT to sell it to him...
The manager of the Gold Saucer... think his name was "Dio". Said he was going to put it in his museum, then he took off out of here.
Come on... it's only a legend. But if it were true, that sure would be something, huh?Now that you mention it, I have heard of something called Ultimate Destruction Magicwas supposed to be hidden somewhere in the Temple of the Ancients.
Come on! I told you not to take it seriously!
All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't been able to get materials...Hey you wouldn't happen to have any Mythril on you, would you? I'll trade you something good if you could spare some.
Hey thanks! All right you can help yourself to either a big or small box.
Hey, don't just come bargin' in here!
What? You want to rest?
Oh all right. You can use that bed.
