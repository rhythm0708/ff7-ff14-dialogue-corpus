I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things.
An informed question. But difficult to answer. I am what you see....You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of here. I'll lead the way.
I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to throw Hojo off guard......
Don't be late. Do you know where the Elevator is? The 66th Floor!
Cetra... That girl, is she a survivor of the Cetra?
The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?
............Grandpa.
What's so funny?
No human could've done this.I'll go on ahead.
Jenova Specimen... Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens.
It looks like it leads up...
I only know his name.
(growling)...a research specimen.
Well then...If you are through talking, may I suggest that we think of a way to get out of here.
Did you say something?
I'm going back to my hometown. I'll go with you as far as that.
...We won't get to Kalm even if we go through these caverns.
If we're planning to meet at Kalm, we should go back and look for it again.
......looks like we've reached Kalm.
We're supposed to meet at the inn. ......Shall we go?
Let's go Cloud.
That would seem to explain the increase in the number of monsters recently.I think we should listen carefully to Cloud. Don't you think so Barret?
What a fascinating story......
[PHS], will put us in constant contact with each other.
It's a power that we should respect...
...... I hoped I'd never see you again...
...You don't see ones like that everyday...Who is that girl? She's still a child.
Hey! My emergency money!
Give... give back what is rightfully mine!
Hey! My emergency money!
Give... give back what is rightfully mine!
Huh? She's gone...... What is she doing?
Hey! My emergency money!
Give... give back what is rightfully mine!
Huh? She's gone...... What is she doing?
Hey! My emergency money!
Give... give back what is rightfully mine!
The Shinra......
That's the reactor. And the condor.
It's not very logical.
So, to protect the eggs, are you gonna protect the reactor?......
You decide what we're going to do.
I got it. Let me lend a hand, too.
Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand, too.
We should get some rest while we can.
...we don't get along well with the Shinra.
Hey! It's a monster!
You know I can't.
Shall we rest?
Does this have something to do with the Shinra?
Cloud, didn't you finish Rufus off?
We're counting on you, Cloud
That looks like a Shinra soldier.
Hey, hurry. You're the last one.
A dolphin gave me a ride.Priscilla remembered the dolphin after you climbed the pole. But, you mustn't be mad at her.
............It's me..I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught.Humans only look at appearances anyway.Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being.
It's the most logical thing to do. Then, who's going to go?
These clothes are too tight on me. Can I switch with you?
Over there, Cloud.
That's what disappeared from the Shinra building...
Sephiroth took Jenova... What does it mean?
The time is now...? What does that mean?
Hmm... The story's not that simple.Cloud, why don't you summarize what's happened so far?
I don't think it's wise to stay here any longer.
...puff... puff...Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose.
It looks like my mane got messed up.I'm going to rest somewhere cool.
Hm, that's interesting.It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to.You see, this tail of mine, moves quite independently of my will.
Grrr.......
...huff... puff... Stop, Cloud!
Grrr, Grrr......... ...huff... puff...
Hmm...... I'm moving on ahead...
Wha? Oh, it's you.There seems to be an instrument in that hut that manipulates this bridge.Perhaps it's best if we rest a moment.
What...?
huff... huff...
Glu... glug...!
Glu... glug...!
What do you mean 'used to'?
.........
.........
......You want to go with me?
Cloud!Don't go by yourself...
What happened?
Read it out loud, Cloud.
To where?
Cloud, it's all right with you?
Are we leaving the others?
What the...
Hey, Cloud!
...did he!?
Are you all right?
Mmm!? Isn't that Barret?
Barret...
I heard that the murders at the Battle Arena were done by a man with a gun-arm. ...Was that you?
Hmm? Shall I go with you?
You're right. Cloud should do it.
Interesting... They were definitely waiting for us.
......someone's been informing them.
I am home! It is I, Nanaki!
They helped me some when I was on the road. Please let them in.
