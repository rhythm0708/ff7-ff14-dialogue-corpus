Oh, Grandpa. Did you forget again...?
It's Shinra, you know, Shinra, Inc.? It's the biggest company in the city.
Yeah. It IS really something.He's doing well, and he told me that he's been promoted to Department Head.
Yeah, I'm really grateful.
All right...
Yeah, good night.

All gramps does is gaze at that rocket all day long.Well he's a man that really loves machinery...
Cough... cough... I've been living in this town for 60 years. And STILL I caught a cold...I heard there's a doctor on a Southern island somewhere. I sure wish he'd come here... cough... cough...
