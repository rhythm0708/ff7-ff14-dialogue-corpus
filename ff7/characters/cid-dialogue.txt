Who is that kid!
What the--!? Gone! It's gone! My money's gone!
Steal MY money, will ya? You got a lot of #&^%$ nerve!!Just remember who you're dealin' with, punk!!
- Give her a lickin'- Forget it!
What the--!? Gone! It's gone! My money's gone!
Steal MY money, will ya? You got a lot of #&^%$ nerve!!Just remember who you're dealin' with, punk!!
- Something like that- You're wasting your time
- GO, then!- ......Hold on!
She's gone, hey...... What's with that kid!?
- ......That's right- What're you sayin'!
- What's your name?- Come on, or we'll leave you!
What the--!? Gone! It's gone! My money's gone!
Steal MY money, will ya? You got a lot of #&^%$ nerve!!Just remember who you're dealin' with, punk!!
She's gone, hey...... What's with that kid!?
What the--!? Gone! It's gone! My money's gone!
Steal MY money, will ya? You got a lot of #&^%$ nerve!!Just remember who you're dealin' with, punk!!
A battlefield, we can't overlook that.
Man, she sure's cold.
Huh? I don't get it.
You guys, what are ya gonna do?
Don't be so wishy-washy. Hurry and make up your mind.
If you've made up your mind, let's just do it.
If you've made up your mind, let's just do it.
If you go that far, what can I say. Well, we'll be able to do something if you leave it up to us.
Come on; let's get some shut-eye.
Man, looks like they've taken a short cut.
And a couple of Shinra dogs are here too!
The air's pretty heavy here. How can you sleep in a place like this?
What the hell are you saying?
...It's startin' to look that way!
It's like you said, the mansion's the beginning of a nightmare.No, it's not a dream, it's the truth.Sephiroth's gone nuts. He found a ton of secrets hidden in this mansion...
Good! I'm not in the mood to hear long stories. Let's get the hell outta here!
Turks!?
, formerly of the Space Program Department.
No idea.
You shouldn't sleep just because of that. Sleep?
I dunno. But we're going after him and Sephiroth. So there's a good chance...
Hey, hold on sleepy. You're pretty damn pushy!
Alright then.
What're you guys doin' here?
Captain? I'm the Captain!The name's . Everyone calls me 'Captain', though.What d'ya want?
Wow! Not bad for a kid.Alright then, I'll explain it to you.You know Shinra developed a lot of technological gadgets during the meaningless war, right?Now it's a Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons manufacturer.Well, they came up with a Rocket Engine.There was so much excitement about the thought of going into outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger.They put a major budget into it and made prototype after prototype! Finally, they completed the Shinra No. 26.They chose the best pilot in Shinra--no, in the world--me. I mean, come on.And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was goin' well...
Ummm... Just look around...
Yeah! It must be news about restarting the Space Program.A young President, that's what we needed! He still has dreams, too!
You out of your *&$^$# mind!? That's my most cherished possession. I can't let you take it.
^%$#! Shera. What are you, blind!?We got guests!! GET SOME TEA! ^%$#!
Shut up! Sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn TEA!Argggggggh! DAMN, I'm pissed!Shera! I'll be in the backyard tunin' up Tiny Bronco!An' make sure to serve them some tea! All right!?
(laughing)Hey! Get your ass in gear! You work like a snail!Even the moon'd get tired waitin' around for your ass!
Don't take so much time checkin' that *%$^# oxygen tank!Shera, bein' careful's good, but it won't do any good, no matter how many times you check that oxygen tank.That thing wouldn't break even if hell froze over.
No buts!!You're not stupid, so be more efficient!
Yeah! Leave it all to me! I'll be back in a few!
Thanks, guys!
Instrument panel... all clear. Shinra No. 26, ready for launch.
......finally.
What the? What happened!?
What!? Who is the little ^%$@!?
Hey goddammit!! Who the &%$#'s still in there?
Shera!? What are you still doin' in there!?
You stupid little ^$#^%!It's gonna get so hot in there that there ain't gonna be SHIT left when we blast off!You're gonna be burnt to a crisp! You're gonna die! You know that, doncha!?
Almost done!? You're gonna die!
Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!
GODDAMNIT, Shera... you wanna make me a murderer?
Shera!?
Come on, Shera... hurry up... You're gonna die...
What... what am I....... What am I supposed to do...?
Oh man, the moon... outer space... my dreams...
SH---------------IT!!
Shera! You still haven't served 'em tea!
Hurry up and sit down! Or ain't my hospitality good enough for you!?They're late... Where is Rufus...?
Well, if it ain't fat man, Palmer. How long were you figurin' on keepin' me waitin'!?
^$#&! Good for nothing, fat &$#$^@!
What the......! You got me all excited for nothing!?Then, what'd you come here for?
&^#^%! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny Bronco.Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take the sky away from me too!?
What!?
Shit!! The tail's been hit!
This's gonna be a big splash. Hold on to your drawers and don't piss in 'em!
She won't fly anymore...
$#&%! Do whatever you want!
Dunno. I'm history with the Shinra and I've given up on the town.
Wife? Don't make me laugh! Just thinkin' 'bout marryin' her gives me the chills.What're you guys gonna do?
I don't know about any of that, but...What the hell!? Sign me up!
Glad to be aboard, numbskulls!
Yeah. Anyone stupid enough to go up against Shinra nowadays, has GOTTA be a numskull! I like it!So, where we headed?Rufus was goin' after Sephiroth towards the Temple of the Ancients.
Dunno. That numskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'The wrong direction'... so maybe it's off this way?
What the HELL is it! Shoutin' out and jumpin' in front of me all of a sudden!
Hey! You, serious?If you're trying to con us, you won't get away with it!
What, the Shinra!?
Yuffie! You sure got some nerve, kid!
Whaddya mean 'THIS one'! 'THIS one'!So you WERE planning some crooked $%*&!!
What the hell's goin' on!I knew I was missing something... My materia's gone!!
Ey... where the hell's that damn kid...?
That little ^%#^$@!!Takin' me for a fool!!No doubt about it! That kid was after my materia from the start!!Hmm... Seems like she went North.Don't be draggin' your asses! We're going right NOW! That $#@^ is history!!
Damn kid! I'll get her no matter what!
You lettin' that damn kid off the hook? I know she's gotta be in this town somewhere!
You lost, Yuffie.
......Dammit, Yuffie. We ain't got time to be listening to your life story.If you want materia, get it yourself. That's how you should do it.
Hmmph... I dunno......
Whoa!?
Hey! Help me first!
Ww, who are you!?
The hell are you doing!
......that's just beautiful! And now that *#$^@'s walked off with Yuffie, too!And without that brat, we can't get our hands on our materia!
Of course! There ain't no way we'd wanna join up with the Turks anyway!Anyhow, which direction did that %^$*& run off in?
Damn, that's hot!I like hot baths, but this is TOO hot!
Hey, hey, hey! That's as far as you go!
Maybe God'd forgive an ugly ^#@# like you, but I won't!
I don't really give a damn! You're gonna let the two girls go, or else I'm gonna break your arm!
Don't be such a poor loser, old man!
So this is how a loser lives...!
I guess, thanks for today.
What the hell's goin' on!? The placement of the materia's all messed up!
Well, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the rest to ol' !
Let ol'  show ya how it's done!
Yeah! I'm all for it!
All we have to do now is sleep! You're still young! What're you complaining about?
The Promised Land?
...zzzz... zzzz...
I don't care what's goin' on let's just go!
Hey, he's got a tattoo. It says number 9.
Shit! Shit! Shit! What the hell's with this place!
Hey hey! What's the catch?
All right! Guess you youngsters gotta be enthusiastic like that!
Let's do it!
What the hell is going on!
I don't know what the hell it is but it's falling from the sky?Hmpf! It's not even an omen.
Guess stuff this dangerous is best left alone?
I'm gonna have a smoke out here!Ahhh!! It's really something, having a smoke at a place like this.
Hey! EY!
Cloud! What the hell are you doing?
H...ey, Cloud.You thinkin' of going skiing? If we wanna find Aeris, we go THAT way!
Yeah, and it looks pretty comfortable.
I'm beat. Why don't we get some rest?
Do you know what TIME it is!?
Wa, wa, wait a minute. You serious!?
Hey, how do you know!?
Shit, Cloud. We can't be sittin' around on our asses.
Dumb #^%@!
I heard that before.
Well, we'll face it when it happens.
...Which way did that creep Sephiroth go!?
Ey, hey! You alright?
I can't be doin' this! Damn!
Quick! The map, the map! Look at it with the [] button!
Damn! If I could just get back in the air, this cliff would be nothing!
Damn, this's somethin'. It's gathered all that energy to try an' heal itself.
Man, I sure am thankful. Wanna rest a while?
Hey, hey,! What's goin' on?
Hoo-boy...
Me and Black Materia just don't mix.
Let me catch some shut-eye.
What the hell? Why Nibelheim!?
Cloud's not here......
Hey, Cloud. Let's get back to the real world, huh.
This is terrible...
He...hey you!You alright!?
Welcome to my airship--the Highwind!
What's wrong!? You should be more excited than that!
Yeah......
(after Tifa speaks to either of the crew)Hey you! What the hell are you doin'!?
Well, it takes all kinds.
I want you to know that I didn't dislike him.Gotta admit he was a strange dude.Just when you thought he was cool, he'd go and do some damn fool thing.And when you thought he was smart, he'd show how stupid he was.Everything about him from his movements to his speech were kinda odd.Knowin' what I do now, I can see why he was that way.Well, as long as you stay alive, you just might see him again someday, so cheer up, sis.
If we can find out where he is, the Highwind'll get us there in no time.
Tifa, sorry, but I've gotta show this moron how to land the ship.Don't worry, it'll be done in a minute.Oh, and Tifa......No matter what your goal is, you've got to be prepared.Go to your room and get ready for our operation.I put a lot of things for the operation in your room, so put them in order.
OK! You just signal when you're ready to fly full speed.
Whoa...!...Consciousness of the Ancients?
Huh? You're sayin' you don't even know who you are?
(the hell's up with this guy?)
Where can I get one of those Whatdyacallem chocobos?
What're you flappin' about? There's one right there!
So where is the chocobo?And what about those nut things?
Great! I know you probably already forgot but,Where can I get one of those chocobos?
Wh, what the hell was that!? That came buzzin' past here like a powerhouse!
Heh, good job, Tifa.
Damn...... that's evil.
Listen Doc, why don't you tell us the truth.What about Cloud? Is he all right?
No wonder...... After all he fell into the Lifestream and was carried down here.
......... Hope............I guess that's all that's left for us now......
You okay?
Yeah. Right. Hang in there, Tifa.
Don't worry. I'll stop by again sometime.
You hang in there, Tifa. Take care of Cloud.
Now, we gotta be headin' back to the Highwind.
......ZZZZ...... hmph?
Pain in the ass. Forget it.
Hm...... this ship's gonna save the Planet, huh? Ain't that gonna be just a little tough?Oh man, that went straight to my heart.I'm a man, too!Okay, I'll do it! Everyone, follow me!
Yeah!!
- Fly Airship- Chew the fat
- Yes- No
Well, let's see...... What's a good place to head to?Corel? Fort Condor?
We found Cloud!
Guess we're safe for now...!
Looks like they're takin' off with the Huge Materia in that train!
Hey, do you know who I am?I'm  - that's who the hell I am! Now just let me handle it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey---!
Don't ask me... I don't know!
Don't worry! I can handle this kinda stuff!Two levers; one on the right and one on the left...I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right!?Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 minutes.We're gonna fly!! Hold on tight!!
DAMN!Sorry! I couldn't catch up to them!
Sorry... I never shoulda gave that Huge Materia to the Shinra so easily...
All right! We're gonna jump!!
All right--- Just hand over the Huge Materia!
You got guts comin' after me!I'll never forget you!
I KNOW, already! Just shut up and keep quiet! If we keep this up, we'll crash right into North Corel!Let's see... If we alternately use the levers to accelerate, ...It should brake if we move the levers up or down simultaneously!
@#*#! The other way!? Just watch, this time, I'll...
SHI---------!!
Oh ^%$#&$! We're gonna crash into North Corel!
^$#@%$! We couldn't stop the train...
- Buy it- Don't buy it
There's only one more Huge Materia the Shinra needs... That's the one at the Underwater Reactor.
With us always in their face, even the Shinra's gotta be getting tired of it all.We have to hurry that much... ...right now I'm more worried about him than anything else!
Yeah, and I'm worried about Tifa, too.Let's go see what's going on at Mideel...
What's next? Shall we head for Fort Condor?
- Like to help but...- I guess we'll help you
What is it?
A battlefield, we can't overlook that.
All right, talk on!
No matter how you look at it, that's a reactor. And on top of it, is that the Condor?
If you go that far, what can I say. Well, we'll be able to do something if you leave it up to us.
- Enough
- Wait- Okay, ready- Hear more
Damn! I guess we have to protect this area, too.
- Wait- Okay, ready- Hear more
Huh? What's this?
What the hell did we fight for?
Just forget about it. Anyway, we're still alive.
So the last Huge Materia that Shinra's after's in the underwater reactor in Junon?
But ya know, Shinra's probably on high alert since we always mess with 'em.How 'bout we take a break and go see that little fella for a bit?
Yeah, I'm worried 'bout Tifa; she may've collapsed takin' care of the guy.How 'bout checkin' in on 'em! Down to Mideel!
God! What the hell happened here!?
Damn!! I can't stand this!
This ain't no joke, Jack.
It's Huge Materia that the Shinra's after...... The only one left is in the underwater reactor in Junon.
Yeah, but ever since we got in their way the last time, they should've gotten a little more cautious.I doubt they'll fly right into action. I'm more concerned about him that anything else.
Yeah, and I'm worried that even Tifa's gonna fall over on her butt.Let's go back and see what's happening?...... to Mideel...
Where shall we go next? Shall we head for the Corel reactor?
Hey......It's tough being the leader.Cloud did a great job. Sheesh......Shall we go to Mideel to check on things?
- Roger- Negative
Damn, why the hell did they make something tricky like this?
Huh...? The hell's this?Looks like a key but it's stuck way down inside, and I can't get it out.Well, what the hell? That's life...
No good... Someone must've locked it.
Okay, there's gotta be a way to get it out.Maybe if I move this a bit...... and push that over...... HAH! Gotcha!
Hey, I know what'll do it... Let's try that beat up old key!- Use the beat up old key!- Forget it
Ulp!!Oh, uh, no, uh I......Damn, this's bad...- What the hell... lie!- Just apologize and get it over with!
Phew... that was a close one. But I kinda feel a little bad about that one......
???
ShopkeeperOf course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.
Say what? You drew that door on the wall?
ShopkeeperThat's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this.
Oh, uh... well Thanks.
 and the others received "Cursed Ring"!
ShopkeeperIf possible, we're hoping to pass through a dream door like that one into another worldI got the feeling that you all might be able to make my dreams come true in my place. Weird, isn't it?
Say what? You drew that door on the wall?
Oh, uh... well Thanks.
What's this!? Your bein' awful friendly.Oh, so that's it. You want the Samolen Greens... don't you?- Give it some Samolen Greens- Don't give it any
Well, guess there's no way around it. Here ya go, shrimp. Eat up.
Heh heh, hey he's kinda cute. Aw, maybe I'll just tickle him a little.- Tickle his feet- Tickle his stomach- Tickle his neck- Tickle his belly button- Tickle behind his ears- Tickle under his arms
Sheesh, you scared me. I thought you croaked!!
Sorry, shorty. But I can't give ya any.
Uh, oh. I'm......- Yeah, I took it old man!- Don't know nothin' 'bout it!
Hey thanks. It'll help, pops!
...............
What did you say, Cloud!?
Damn. What the hell's goin' on!?
What's this...!?The Lifestream is gushing up from below the surface of the earth!
Damn, that's......!? This is bad......!!
N, nothin'!! You and Cloud get inside quick!!
Hey, don't worry about a thing. I ain't about to die that easily.
Okay, here I go! Watch this!!
Damn!! That &%$^%$ Weapon!!Of all the times to show up......!OK then, come on!! You &$^%$!
You &^$#&$#! You tryin' to escape?
Damn, you gotta be kiddin'......!!Th, this's bad......! The main stream is kickin' up!!Somethin' way bigger than that last one is on its way!!No good!! Get outta here......!!
Goddammit!!You don't have time to worry about anyone other than yourself! You don't know when that stream'll blow......Whoa!!There's no time, hurry!!
Tifa!! Cloud!! Get outta here!!
I know how tough it is bein' a leader, because I've been one.I always forget who has what materia.
That's what you think! ^%$@#&$#!
You know I don't work for cheap!
Hold on to your horses! Let's get it from them!!
Hey, hey, hey! Where do you think you're goin'?
DAMN-SAM! I've GOT to get back in the air!
Hunka junk... just gotta do this!SEE! Now you take over!
I'll be watchin' from here!
Make 'em shut up! Just answer somethin'!
The airport? No sweat!
Damn! What are we gonna do!
God!! I'm drenched!Hurry up! Let's get to the airport!
You want it? Then you gotta have it! They're down at the submarine dock underneath Junon! You gotta get what you want while you can!
Grrrrgh! Just barely! We're goin' after it!
Where's that thing headed?
You said there's somethin' goin' on at Rocket Town...?
I'm so sick of hearing these dumb puns, but okay... let's get it over with. Go on... let me hear it.
And?
...I thought it might be fun to hear some of your stupid puns again for old times sake... my mistake.
Dammit! That does it!
Rude, hell! You're the one who always cracks those #$##@& jokes!
Wait, Cloud!If you're gonna kick those *#$% Shinra out of my rocket, then take me with you!ALL RIGHT! Let's show those &$!@& Shinra!
Goddammit, what the hell do they think they're gonna do to my rocket!?I'm outta here, Cloud! I'm gonna kick those $^%$# Shinra right out of my rocket!
Cloud, what are you doin'!? There gonna launch the rocket!!
Hey! What the hell're you guys doin'!?
Huh? What are you talkin' 'bout?
Shut up!! Just shut the hell up!
Broken? How's the repair goin'?
Oh great! What a buncha wizards you guys are! She's gonna take a 100 years!I'll take over, so don't worry about the Auto-Pilot!Hey, go ahead! Go tell everyone!
Yeah, I understand. I understand that Materia is precious, and I also understand what you're thinking.But listen.I don't give a rat's ass whether it's science or magical power.No, I guess if I had to choose, I'd rather put my money on the power of science.Humans who used to only roam around on the ground are able to fly now!And finally, we're about to go into outer space.Science is a "Power" created and developed by humans. And science just might be what saves this planet.I was able to earn my living thanks to science. So to me, there's nothing greater!Now quit your worrying 'bout what Shinra's gonna do!I don't want to regret not having done something later.
Shut the hell up!! I don't wanna hear it!!Alright, time to get to work! Anyone who ain't involved, get the hell outta here!
What the hell......? What the hell happened!?
Palmer! What the hell did'ya do!?
Goddamn Shera! Why'd she pick today to get fast!
What the!? No countdown!? It just don't seem the same without it!
I finally made it... outer space...Let's see, how's the course set...?Yup, it's headed for a collision with Meteor.
That damn Palmer went outta his way to lock the Auto-Pilot device. We might not be able to change the course.
Huh? What the hell're you sayin'? You're still young, and you give up that easily?I'm not gonna crash into Meteor.Just watch.I keep an Escape Pod on the rocket just for emergencies like this.I deciphered the lock code on the Escape Pod. We'll bail right before we crash into Meteor.
......If you want the Materia, do whatever you want!The Materia should be there after you climb that ladder.
I dunno...I know what I said a minute ago.But maybe all that I really wanted was just to go into outer space.So, why don't you all do whatever you think is right?
Hey, Cloud.If you're goin' to get the Materia, it's this way.
It's structured so that the lock can be opened if we enter the passcode from this control panel.Hey Cloud, you know how to use it, right?Everytime it says, 'Enter Passcode,' push one of those O X △ ◻ buttons.If you punch in the right code, it'll unlock and you can get the Huge Materia!
I dunno. Just try and punch in the code randomly.
Whoa, pretty good! You got the passcode in a single try!You must've known the passcode. If not, it's impossible.
Seems like you missed the code!If we don't enter the correct passcode before the Protection System activates, we won't be able to get the Materia back!I heard there's a passcode only the top people in Shinra know.We probably have to enter that. Try and enter some codes while I try and remember that passcode!I think the first digit wasn't a ◻.I think the second digit wasn't an X...The second digit wasn't a △. I'm sure of it!The third digit was an X ......I think.I'm pretty sure that the last digit was a △. No, maybe it was an X...?I have a feeling you push the O only once...Did you use the △? I'm pretty sure you didn't...I think there was a key that you have to push twice...Hmmmmmm, I can't remember. Give me some more time!
Alright, Cloud!! It's unlocked!Yup, my great advice saved the day.
Ahhh &$#$#! The Protection System just activated!...Cloud, too bad, but we gotta let it go.
Grrrgh!Damn! My leg's stuck in the debris......
Don't worry 'bout me. Hurry up and go! If you don't hurry, the rocket's gonna crash into Meteor!
You ^%#@&%......! No time to worry 'bout other people!
You're stupid. You're really $#&^%$* stupid.Tank Number 8 blew up...... So Tank Number 8... really was malfunctioning......Shera... You were right.But, ......this is the end for me.
Huh!? Shera!?
You stupid &$#&%*%&%#!!......Sorry.
Hey, Shera! Does this Pod really fly?
.........Then I'm relieved.
(plastered to the window)So this is...... outer space...Man... it's the real thing... I'm really here in outer space...So long, Shinra No. 26...
Hey! The girl's right.You start worryin' and there's no stoppin' it! Things just start fallin' apart and get worse and worse.
Yeah, I been thinkin' about this and that.All the time we been up here lookin' at the planet.I been thinkin' even when we were floatin' in the ocean in that escape pod.
Maybe you're right.But I came up with something different.I always thought this planet was so huge.But lookin' at it from space, I realized it's so small.We're just floatin' in the dark. ......kind of makes you feel powerless.On top of that it's got Sephiroth festerin' inside it like a sickness.That's why I say this planet's still a kid.A little kid sick and trembling in the middle of this huge universe.Someone's gotta protect it.Ya follow me? That someone is us.
...............I'm still thinkin' about that.
Maybe it's just me, but has this ship been remodeled without me knowin' it?All these switches and levers. They're kinda gettin' to me.
Hmm? Let me see that.
Don't get mad, you'll just get more wrinkles. Hey, something's comin' out.
Hey, Cloud. Let me hop on sometime.
Hey, Cloud. Let me hop on sometime.
My head feels like it's gettin' crushed!
Ahh, no good. Cloud you call the others in here too!
What, did that girl go off to that place?
What's it?
Yeah, hoo boy, the planet calling... right.
Aeris...?I wanted to give her a ride in the Highwind......
Phew...... Cloud. What're gonna do?
You &^$#%^! It's WE! WE!
The big gift the flower girl left for us... it'd be sad if we didn't finish it!
What's wrong!?
From where?
Hey Cloud......You think we can win against that monster? We got a chance of winnin', right?
That reminds me, there was a test rocket that landed in the Slums of Midgar long ago.I remember I was relieved when I heard it never blew up.
Hey, HEY! What're ya tryin' to do? Break the Highwind? Let's fight on the ground!
What's wrong? It's like you're blowing us off!
To my ship!
Maybe this is the time?
Huh? He's my student, ain't he!? Of course he can go anywhere!
We came a long way to get here. You better not double-cross us now!
You damn fool! Don't you understand anything I'm saying?I don't give a damn about Shinra. If you're a man... no, if you're a human being, you'll save the planet! Don't you even care?
Why? Can't you just shut off the valve?
Hey!I'm leaving the ship in your hands!
We're busy runnin' back and forth!Even my bikini goddess would be pantin' about now!
Hey, hey, whaddya think we have Highwind for?Where are we now!?
If land's no go... We'll go by air!
Yeah! Let's get it over with!
Which way...!?Goddamn, piece of $#@^% cannon!!
Hey-hey! You serious...?
%$#&$*&^%^
Maybe ain't none of us'll come back.Meteor's gonna kill us all anyway. Let's just forget any useless struggling!
Hey, Nanaki.If you butt in now, you never know what they'll say later......
We can't let it go like this.
Has anyone here changed their mind?
Yeah, yeah......There are 2 levers here that've been buggin' me for a while now...Let me try them out.All right, so what should I do?You decide, Cloud.
Man, I'm going to stick it to him!
Errrrggh! Some incredible force! Losing... control......!
Get the hell outta here, flunkies! Didn't I tell you all to go home!?
Oh ma--......stop trying to act so cool.All right, you jokers! Hold me down with everything you got!!Geronimo!!
You ever see the play 'LOVELESS'?
Yeah, I figured someone like you wouldn't be much on plays.
Yeah? Really? Well, that's fine.They've been doin' that play every summer since I was a kid.An' I remember seein' it just once...That was when I was in Midgar interviewing to be a pilot.I had some free time and thought I'd catch the play.Now, I'm no big fan of the theater or anything.But this thing put me to sleep, just like I thought it would.Finally during the last scene, the guy next to me woke me up tellin' me my snorin' was too loud.So about all I really remember of that play is the end...The sister of the lead asks her lover,Do you really have to leave?And the guy says,I promised. The people I love, are waiting.......I don't understand. Not at all. But...... please take care of yourself.Of course... I'll come back to you. Even if you don't promise to wait. I'll return knowing that you'll be here.I remember thinking when I heard those lines,*&%! What the hell's he talkin' about? But, you know... now I'm not so sure...I think I understand......
When this job's done, I'm landing the ship... yeah, that's what I'll do.
Which you gonna choose, Cloud?
All right! I'm headin'...
I'll destroy that Sephiroth before anyone gets to him!
Which way you gonna go Cloud?
All right! I'm heading...
Sephiroth's probably crapping his pants right about now...
I can't let you guys go by yourselves, you'll make me worry.
Hey, Cloud, I found this on the way.
Yeah, Yuffie, didn't you pick up something on the way?
Let's just get this over with!
Damn! Again!Stop sayin' it like a wimp!Can't you say 'Move out!' or somethin'?
