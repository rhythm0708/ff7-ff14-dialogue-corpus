Mmm? I'm not going to the parade.The road to becoming SOLDIER First Class is very difficult.Don't mind me.As a man with promise and future, I don't have any time to fool around like the rest of you.
Ugh... My eyes are tired... No, this is the time for me to really buckle down!Until I become SOLDIER First Class.
I lost most of my rivals in the attack on Weapon.Oh, of course, I was here, studying.And the coveted green officer's uniform is almost in my reach.After that, I'll get on the newspapers as a plain clothed First Class officer in SOLDIER...A triumphant return to my homeland!! Tons of fan letters... My future's peachy!
