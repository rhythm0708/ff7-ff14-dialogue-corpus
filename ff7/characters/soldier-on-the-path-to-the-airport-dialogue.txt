Right now the Shinra's using it to gather the Huge Materia from the Corel Reactor and from the Fort Condor Reactor.The Gelnika's flying all over the place! The only one that's not busy, is probably me!
The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea Reactor!When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport.Get out of here before you get in the way!What... me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get in their way either!
Finished loading the Huge Materia!All we have to do now is to ready the cargo ship, 'Gelnika', for departure and we're done!
I'm glad we got Gelnika to the Rocket Town safely.But they sure think big. Looks like they're going to use the Huge Materia's to break up Meteor...
I finally got orders to join the Great Sephiroth Plan. I even get to go on the Gelnika too...But, I'm just gonna ignore them. I wanna live to see the end of the world.If I'm lucky... There'll be a good place for me in the New World.
