Hey bubby, how old are you?
You're less than half my age. I'm so jealous.So how 'bout it...?Do you wanna join my "Young bubby's" group?
Well, if that's how you feel... too bad.We have a trip planned at a cabin out in the country.
Why don't you stick around and play a bit?Daddy's so lonely...
Bubby!! This is important to me.Here's a memento of our time together!
Hope we meet again!
I really like this town.You could walk around nearly naked, and no one'd look twice at you.
I'm just sitting here havin' a quiet drink.
