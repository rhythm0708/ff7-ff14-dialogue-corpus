I hear that the natural resources near the reactors are being sucked dry.We're better off with them bringing in the Mako energy.
The meteor's going to fall, isn't it? Unless Shinra does something about it, then we're all history!
(checking the Mako pressure)What're you doing checking the pressure of the Mako energy at a time like this? It's probably already too late......It's times like this when you shouldn't go into a tail spin. You've got to continue to live orderly just like before.At least that's what I think...
