So, what do you need, Cloud?
Yeah, he's upstairs.
It's all reserved for you Shinra people, so I don't mind. But, wouldn't you feel more comfortable staying at home?
Now about the town...A lot of monsters have been appearing in the last 12 months.Other than that, there's not much change. Nothing much exciting happens in a little town like this.It was all right when they were building the reactor....while they were still building it.But once it was completed, it's been bad.Within a few years, all the trees on the mountain withered away.I don't know if the reactor was good or bad...I mean it's easy to say that it was a bad idea now. But now, what can you do about it...?Anyhow we've got to get rid of the monsters...Then, we'll all be able to relax a little bit.
So, what do you need, Cloud?

Hey, you want to rest?
It's already been paid for. Go on, get some rest.
