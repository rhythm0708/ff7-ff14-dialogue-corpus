The world's at peace... all's well.I got my health, and enough to eat... all's well.
The world's changed a lot in the past few days......That huge monster Meteor was covering up the sky and acting like he owned it or something...A lot of my friends have died......I'm goin' on a journey to pray for their souls.A map that was sunk along with the ship. ...... "Guidebook"A rose that blooms once every 1000 years in the desert. ...... "Desert Rose"A harp that soothes those who hear it. ...... "Earth Harp"I wonder if there's anyone who'll bring it to me?
OH! It's "Guidebook"! Wanna trade it for this Underwater Materia?How about it?
Ok then, it's a done deal!
OH! It's "Desert Rose"! Wanna trade it for that Chocobo over there?How about it?
Ok then, it's a done deal!
OH! It's the Earth Harp! Wanna trade it for some Master Materia?I'm not bein' stingy either! I'll give you all three of 'em!How about it?
Ok then, it's a done deal!It's a 3-piece Master Materia set... and it's all yours!
"[item]" and "[item]"... Will you guys look for them for me?Now if I can just get "[item]", I can start my journey...
I guess it's time to go on a journey for the souls of my departed friends......
