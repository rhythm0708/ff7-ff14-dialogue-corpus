Here now. The way you're running around here, you'd think Meteor fell or something.
A friend...?Oh yeah......! That young fellow!?Don't worry. Your friend is next door. But I'm afraid his condition is...
Mako poisoning...... Quite an advanced case......It appears this young man's been exposed to a high level of Mako energy for a protracted period of time.He probably has no idea who or where he is now......Poor fellow, his voice doesn't even work. He is literally miles away from us.Some place far away where no one's ever been... All alone......
Ahem! Let us excuse ourselves.Listen, would you all mind...... waiting outside?
I'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning. I've never seen a case this bad...An immense amount of Mako-drenched knowledge was put into his brain all at once......No normal human could have survived it...... It's a miracle he did!
But remember, the light of hope can be found anywhere.Listen, if you give up hope... What will happen to him?
Is something wrong?
I'm sorry...... But your friend's condition remains unchanged......You'll have to be patient and wait this out. These things take time. Just like fine wine, time is of the essence.
This isn't good!! It's big!
Hmm...... It might be safer to take refuge in a wide open space.
No! The structure can't take it!! Hurry!
Hmphf? You...!? How did you recover from your Mako poisoning?This is absolutely amazing...... I am so glad for you! Looks like your friends' wishes came true.You can see for yourself what things look like, but at least no one was seriously hurt. We're just very unhappy now.
