Tifa...... did you forget...... about those days?
No...... it's all right. You were having a hard time back then.You were so busy with your own things, it's only natural you don't remember me back then.
It's important to me...... I hate to say it but... It's a very important memory......Do you want to see it?
Come on, hurry.
Do you know where this window goes to, Tifa?Fine...... I'll go.
It was my first time there.
I only used to look up at it from outside.
Tifa always used to be with this three-some.
I used to think... they were all stupid.
You were all childish, laughing at every little stupid thing.
...I know. I'm the one that was stupid.I really wanted to play with everyone, but I was never allowed into the group.Then later... I began to think I was different...That I was different from those immature kids.That then... maybe...
I was so prejudiced. And... weak.
Thanks, Tifa.Tell him what you told me, later. He'll probably be so happy.
This was the day...
Then... this is goodbye, Tifa. Until we meet again......
