My old man was a miner, but he couldn't go to work after monsters started appearing in the Mythril Mine.Now all he does is sit around getting drunk in the bar...
My dad still just sits at the bar drinking, even though he knows that Meteor's coming!It's sad. Even though he's an adult, he just doesn't want to see the world as it really is. I dunno what to do.
