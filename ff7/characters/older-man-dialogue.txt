Hey hey! Priscilla, are you alright?
Sorry, Cloud. Priscilla needs to rest for a while.
What? Cloud is missing?
What? The Northern... what? Sorry, but I don't think I follow.But... I think I remember hearing Priscilla saying 'Life... something' before.
I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe underwater.The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe.You should be able to get to the reactor through it.
I just saw some Shinra soldiers all huddled together discussing something.They said a plane carrying Huge Materia would be taking off from the airport above.
Listen Cloud, I'm over the hill, but Priscilla is still a child.Isn't there a way to protect at least her from Meteor?
