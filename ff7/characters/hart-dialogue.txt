How do you do?This is the Midgar Mayor's Office. Mayor Domino is in his office.I am the Deputy Mayor. If you should have any questions feel free to ask me...
Did you speak with the Mayor?What? A password? Oh, I get it...He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really blame him, Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra.Maybe I can help you.What do you want to know?
Sure, sure. All right.As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people.So here's a hint......for 500 gil.
Oh, my... well, Thank you very much.Now listen. On this floor are four research libraries for four different sections of Shinra, Inc. ...Parts of the password are hidden in each of the libraries.Pay careful attention to the files in each room.The name of each library is written on the plaque outside the door.What can I do for you?
Sure, sure. All right.As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people. So here's a hint......for 1000 gil.
Oh, my... well, Thank you very much.Now, in each library will be one file mixed in from another library.Look carefully at the numbers on each file.What can I do for you?
Sure, sure. All right.As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people.So here's a hint......for 2000 gil.
Oh, my... well, Thank you very much.There is a number at the beginning of each file name.Of course there's a number even on the files that don't belong in that library.Match the number with the letters in the title of the file.If the file starts with a 4, then check the fourth letter and... well, you get the idea.
Hey now! You're a bit short.I'm sure even item stores in the slums don't give credit nowadays.
...I see. Then, I guess that's that.Good luck finding it on your own.If you still can't find it. I'll just be right over here. Ready to tell you anytime...
If you run into President Shinra please don't tell him about this.I can't be a partner to anymore trouble for Shinra.
