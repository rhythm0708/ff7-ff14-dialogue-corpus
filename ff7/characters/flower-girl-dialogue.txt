Excuse me.What happened?
Really? I don't know what's going on, but all right.
Oh, these? Do you like them? They're only a gil...?
Oh, thank you!Here you are!
Ahh... not again.
What! Tell me!Uh, excuse me, would you like to buy some flowers? They're only one gil.
Oh, thank you!Here you are!
Ahh... not again.
Oh! It moved!Whew... Am I glad.
Hello, hello?
Hello, hello!
You okay?This is a church in the Sector 5 slums.It suddenly fell on top of me. It really gave me a scare.
The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall. You're lucky.
That's all right. The flowers here are quite resilient because this is a sacred place.They say you can't grow grass and flowers in Midgar.But for some reason, the flowers have no trouble blooming here.I love it here.
......So, we meet again.......Don't you remember me?
Oh! I'm so happy!Thanks for buying my flowers.
Excuse me, but that's really rude!I don't remember a thing.But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me.
......I guess you don't remember. You were walking in a daze.But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me.
Say, do you have any materia?
But mine is special. It's good for absolutely nothing.
No, I do...... it just doesn't do anything.I feel safe just having it. It was my mother's......Say, I feel like talking. Do you feel up to it?After all, here we are meeting again, right?
Wait here. I've got to check my flowers. It'll just be a minute.
......oh, I see.Ahhh. I wonder whose fault that is. It takes a lot to grow them, you know. Poor flowers.
Just a little longer.Oh!Now that you mention it......We don't know each other's names, do we?My name is......I'm Aeris, the flower girl. Nice to meet you.
