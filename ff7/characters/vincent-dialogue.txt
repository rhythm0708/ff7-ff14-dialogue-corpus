She has a mysterious weapon... I've seen her somewhere before...
...... Difficult to understand her motivation.Hmm? ......pretty fast.
The Gil doesn't seem to be her real objective...

What do you mean by that?
There's no harm in listening to them.
Come to think of it, there was a reactor. But I've never seen anything shaped like it......
......That's too much.
......and come out in one piece?
It's difficult to get back what you've lost......
That's the right decision.
Now don't regret what's already past.
That's the right decision.
It's probably best to get some rest now.
How did they know that we were here...
Means there's a Shinra spy...?
...To wake me from the nightmare
Hmph... a nightmare...? My long sleep has given me time to atone.
I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out.This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare.
Hmm? What do you know?
I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare......What? More?
Sephiroth!?
You start first.
So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago? And about the Jenova Project?...He was missing, but has just recently reappeared.He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land.
Sorry... I cannot speak.
Hearing your stories, has added upon me yet another sin.More nightmares shall come to me now, more than I previously had.
I was with... the Shinra Manufacturing Department in Administrative Research, otherwise known as--the Turks....
Formerly of the Turks.I have no affiliation with Shinra now....And you?
You were also with Shinra...? Then do you know Lucrecia?
......Lucrecia.
The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth.
That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory.He was born from a beautiful lady.That lady was Lucrecia.She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. Beautiful... Lucrecia.
There was no way to cancel the experiment.I couldn't stop her.That was my sin.I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst.
Let me sleep...
Wait!If I go with you will I meet Hojo?
Lucrecia...All right. I've decided to go with you.
Being a former Turks, I may be of help to you...
...Want me to keep watch?
. My occupation is...... forget it.
............
...It's amazing that you can live with it.
It's not going to stop...
...Do whatever you like.
What happened all of a sudden? Did something happen?
Further down? I don't see any signs of danger...Also, there's something unnatural in the way Yuffie's acting...
So what does this mean... You will explain this later...
What do you mean, 'This one'?You had something else in mind?
I thought something was wrong, So that's it.Look, my materia's been stolen...
Inexcusable...Seems as though all that she was after was our materia.We can't just let her get away. She ran off...... to the North...We must go after her and retrieve our materia back.
She couldn't have left town... I think she is must still be here... Or do you want to go on?
There was nothing else to do.
!?
Wait, don't go by yourself!
I don't care what you're doing, so much as the idiotic way you're doing it...
......!
It would appear thanks are in order...
Hmm... You may come if you want to...
Hmph...I'll show them what real fighting is.
Good idea.
Hey Cid, let's go back to our rooms.
The Temple of the Ancients... This might be pretty interesting...
It's a number 9 tattoo.
No exits... We can't turn back.
An illusion that the Ancients showed...
......
A battle...
What are you doing?
Something huge is falling from the sky?
I guess that means it's safe here.
I'll be looking around here.
......!
Cloud!
Wait, Cloud.This is the road to the Northern Mountains. Don't you want to find Aeris?
I wonder if the owners used this?
Maybe we should take a short nap?
...What's wrong?
...If that's true, then we're in for it.
...How did you find that out?
If that's true, we should hurry. Something terrible could happen at any moment.
Stop it!
...You're right.
...I guess so.
Which way did Sephiroth head?
...you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
We should check it on the map. Press the [] button.
I wonder what's on the other side of the cliff...
It's amassed a vast amount of energy to heal itself.
Don't be caught off guard...... Sephiroth may be near.
Stay on alert. You never know when Sephiroth might appear.
You mean... we weren't in pursuit of Sephiroth...?
How about if you hold on to the Black Materia?
You never know when Sephiroth may show up... so don't let your guard down.
...Why...... is it an illusion?
...It's not Cloud. Who is this man?
Now, how can we get out of here...?
...All this... while I was sleeping...
...You all right?Hmm... it was an illusion.
......So glad you're all right Tifa.
Too much hope is the opposite of despair.An overpowering love may consume you in the end......
You've found him.
.........
Do what you wish.
Don't worry. We'll return and check on him later.
Take care of him.
Very well then, we should be getting back to the Highwind.
Cid...... I wish I had your go-get-them attitude.It appears my feelings vanished into thin air ever since I was in that long slumber......
!!
...go after them?
I'm impressed. You can drive this too...?
Wha... what...!?
...Isn't it too early to give up?
Hit the brakes, Chief.
Isn't it... the other way?
......!!
A spectacular sight...
Are we going to the Underwater Reactor?
Cloud...
......Don't expect anything else from me except fighting beside you.I don't have any comforting words.Of course, I don't believe you're the type of guy who needs kindness from other's......
What do you mean by that?
That's the right decision.
We must protect this area.
This is......
Getting to the reactor before them...
Seems like we survived.
We might have understimated the situation.
This is a rather harsh reality.
We've got to get there first and stop them.
Cloud, it's you......
You look really tired, maybe you're ready to give up being leader?
Hmm...... Looks like escape is their best skill.
And the Lifestream also appears to be normal.
Escape from a world of illusions... Hmph... I wonder which is better...?
We were a little late...
I refuse...
There is one way...
Better hurry. Reno's getting away.
I'm not very mechanical, but it seems like we're starting to move.Hang in there.
Shinra's technology is really something.
We've no choice but to respond.
First the ocean, now the air... What a busy day.
We're at the bottom of the sea.
It seems as though we made it. You'll probably head for the airport, right?
It should be alright.
Let's go after it.
Where is their destination...?
...how does it feel, Cloud? Living for yourself and not someone else?
We're in space now. A long rest...
Then the remaining question is what to do with the Huge Materia.
...no. I can't lift it.
The machines in Cosmo Canyon were presents of Dr. Gast.Wrapped up in the planet's strange notions surrounded by Shinra-made machines...Science and the planet lived side by side in that old man's heart.
My head is about to be crushed.
That voice? It can't be...
(running towards her)Lucrecia!!
I'm against it!! Why experiments on humans!?
Urrrrrrrrgh!!
Lucrecia... You're alive...
......What?
Lucrecia... Sephiroth is dead...
Lucrecia......
I don't know, Cloud. I think we should have everyone here.
City of the Ancients...The Ancients... after a long time that is probably what others will come to call us...Hmmm... hwa ha ha ha... It's only a matter of time for us.
......feelings alone aren't enough. ...it's irritating, isn't it Cloud?
I? ...you mean WE.
The hope an important person left for us... We must make it stronger...
......we still can't seem to get near Sephiroth...
Doesn't look like it's after us. Something else...
We should go back to the ship now.
Defeat Sephiroth... Defeat the son of that beloved woman...Am I on the verge of committing another sin......?Or am I atoning as best I can for only watching...?
Hojo... what a queer fellow.Such utter lack of scientific talent... compared with the genius of Dr. Gast......Lucrecia chose him trying to protect him...Now I understand... I understand... but...
So it was Hojo who stirred up all this commotion, after all these years...?
......!
(on a lower platform, watching)Damn! Hojo...!
......!
You......!
......I was...... wrong. The one that should have slept was......You, Hojo!
Hojo...rest in peace...
Why such a puzzled look?You don't want me to come?
Cool?Hmm...... I guess that's just how I am, sorry.
Cloud...... take the ship to the Northern Cave.The time for flying is now past.Our battlefield is now beneath the earth...The gate to tomorrow is not the light of heaven, but the darkness of the depths of the earth......
Then, I will be going......
It's all over now. With this...
What now, Cloud...?
If so, I will be going...
Let's go...
You sure are hasty.
Hold on to this.
Yuffie, just let Cloud have it.
Hmm... Being with you all is not so bad.
Hmm, this might be fun to pass time.
What's this...!?
Damn...!I was frozen in time...... But now I feel as though my time is finally about to begin...!Sephiroth, now it's your time to sleep between the ages!!
