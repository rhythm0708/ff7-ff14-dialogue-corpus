When you've been a train man as long as I have, you see a lot of people and a lot of lives.People meeting, parting, joy, sadness... After a while, it doesn't even get to you anymore.I wonder how long it's been... There's an invisible rail between me and the passengers.I could never live their lives. I'm just a train man plain and simple. It's easier that way.That's not to say that the crossing gate of my heart doesn't hurt now and again.Back during the war, I remember there was a lot of painful scenes then.But, that's a story for another day...First train leaves Midgar at 05:04am.
Morning. Dawn comes and things never change.You be careful not to get hurt. Come on back again, hear?ALL ABOARD! The train is about to depart.
I heard a rumor that the plate was going to fall, crushing this station, I've worked at so many years.But I just can't bear to leave here.
Hey everyone! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and get on!Ride the Ropeway?
The Ropeway takes you to the 'Gold Saucer'. It's free, so don't worry about it.
What's the matter?
......poor kid.
The Gold Saucer is currently closed. The Ropeway's up and runnin', but there's no point in goin' there.
The Gold Saucer reopened. Why don't you go play hard and clear your heads as well as your pockets?
