Don't bug me. This is Rufus's first official visit since becoming President.It seems like he's here on business this time.I'm so jealous of him, I could spit. We're both about the same age, but, he's President.
Rufus complimented me on my job!Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work.
Ever since Rufus complimented him, he ran around for a while, And we haven't heard a peep from him since...
Everyone's in a rush to get one last vacation in before the Meteor strikes, That's why it's so busy here.
