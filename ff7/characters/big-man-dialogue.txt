Unn......!! Who the hell are you!? No unauthorized access.Since today's special, I'm gonna let you in on a juicy bit of news. But you gotta keep it to yourself.Do you know what's been going on......?
I guess you must be sick of hearing it... But it's been so long since there was any real news here.You're worried where it's all heading, right?
Everything's in a buzz 'bout that terrorist group AVALANCHE blowin' up the Sector 1 Mako Reactor.On the surface they say they're an anti-Shinra group, but in reality...They say they're just out to kill as many people as they can.Gyaaaa, Haaa haaa!!That's a good one, ain't it!? While they're bustin' things up on top, the only ones makin' out good are us weapon stores!Now, if we can just get rid of this back stock, we'll be doin' ok.
This is the Beginner's Hall.You say you're a beginner? But your eyes say you're not.
YOU know who's responsible for North Corel winding up like this!
Want to enter the Chocobo Race?
You thinkin' of livin' here forever? Then live a long life!
Then go get permission with the boss of this place.
You don't even know that? Oh man.
Look down... nuthin' but junk. Look up... Meteor.Am I gonna be stuck between these two for the rest of my life?
Some Shinra soldiers went up to Mt. Corel. They said they're collecting Huge Materia to blow up Meteor!Ya think they can really do it...? I'll bet the reactor destroys everything even before Meteor hits!
Aren't you the ones that stopped the Shinra Train?The Shinra was just about to destroy our lives again...
That's it!Hey, kid! How about givin' somethin' to these guys fightin' the Shinra?
I figure if I stay alive long enough, something good's bound to happen.
We've lost everything... Now we have to start again from '1'... no, from '0'.
