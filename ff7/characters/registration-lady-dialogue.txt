Hey, have you heard? Something awful happened!Two staff members and some Shinra soldiers were shot.The soldiers died instantly, but the staff survived.
Register for battle? The registration fee is 10 GP.
This is a one-on-one battle. Which one of you will participate?
Those two over there eloped, saying stuff like 'OUr last moments together---' I can't bear it.I don't have anyone like that in my life so, if something happens, it happens....that's why I'm working now. Oh, sorry for going off like that...
Um, I'm sorry, that's only for registered participants. You won't be able to go in through there until you come and register.
You know, I've been thinking about it for a while now, but you must be pretty strong?Probably strong enough to take on the top 1 or 2 fighters?Maybe you'll be good enough for the big match......How 'bout it? There's a private battle only for the strongest. Wanna try?
