Hear the rules for this attraction?
This attraction, Shooting Coaster isWhile your ride's going ZOOM, you're going BANG BANG, and things are going PHEW PHEW and you destroy them with a big BOOM. Pretty simple, isn't it?Oh, to shoot, hit the O Button. And, the Bar that's shown on the left side of the screen is the Power Meter.When it's full, it'll go BROOOOOM and when it's empty, it'll only go BRM and become weak. So be careful.Also, if you're in the Top 3 you'll get on the Wall of Fame.
