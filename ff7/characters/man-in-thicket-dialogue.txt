No, don't!! It's a steep downgrade, past here.It's dangerous, please don't go!
Damn, I was just being nice...What the? Who are those people over there? Looks like trouble!
No, no. I just did what came natural.All right, I'm not too busy now. Do you want me to teach you how to ride a snowboard?
Do you want me to explain again?
You're so boring!
What the...? They sure were weak for Shinras.
Sorry I just took off a while ago... It looked like there was going to be trouble.Anyhow, you'll need a snowboard to get down that hill. Want me to teach you how to ride one?
Do you want me to explain again?
All right, big-head... But don't blame me if you get hurt.
Be careful!
There's a barrier at the North end of the crater! You shouldn't go any further.
A bright light hsattered the barrier at the crater! What in the world's goin' on!?
