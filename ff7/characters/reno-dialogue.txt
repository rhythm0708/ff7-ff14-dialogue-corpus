Don't worry about me.
I haven't decided yet.
They were...... Mako eyes.Yeah, all right. Back to work, back to work.
There they are, over there!
The Ancient is getting away! Attack! Attack! Attack!
Think we killed 'em? They shouldn't have put up a fight, I say!
You're too late. Once I push this button...
I can't have you do that. No one gets in the way of  and the Turks...
Try and break it if you can.
It's time.
The President's safety is secure because we're here.
Hey, Rude. Who do you like?
What are you getting so embarrassed about? Come on? Who do you like?
Hmmmm...That's a tough one.But, poor Elena. She...... you......
I never knew that! But Tseng likes that Ancient...
Hmm... Then it's time...Rude... Don't go easy on them even though they're girls.
It's been a while.
Payback time for what you did in Sector 7.
That's sad.
I don't like being taken for a fool.
This is just part of the job. Don't take it personally.
We may be retreating, but...we're still victorious!
...Elena, you talk too much.
What are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?
Now our vacation is ruined.
Drink, Rude! How long have we been a team...?There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm glad I did it.I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you.
...what a drag.
Right now we're off duty and can't run off to save your butts.
If you knew that, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' me sober.
Elena. Don't misunderstand.A pro isn't someone who sacrifices himself for his job. That's just a fool.
Relax. She's not a child. Let her have her way now...
......It's just that we're off duty!I don't feel like drinking with you. And don't talk to me.
Hmm... that Corneo is good at escaping...
Let's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can do.
......Sounded pretty good.
Don't misunderstand.We have no intention of joining you. But for now, we'll agree not to bother each other. That's all.
Hmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the place that stands out the most.
You're finally here. We're gonna split into two.You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena.Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, Yuffie.For now...
Don't fool around. You know the enemy's not gonna wait for us, right?
No, that would be us.
You knew this was gonna happen ever since you leaked that secret.We're going to take care of you... personally.
Good timing, Rude.
All right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up.Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with those guys to get you...?1. Because we were ready to die2. Because we were sure of victory3. Because we were clueless
All wrong.
The correct answer was...
Elena, don't act so weak.You're a Turks!
Yes... this is .Yes... Yes... I'll get on it right away.
Yeah, they want us to find Cloud...
No, today we're off duty.
What are you doing? Help load.
Unfortunately, I don't have time to deal with you.My priority is the Huge Materia!
We just seem to keep running into each other lately!There were weapons and Materia developed solely to destroy Sephiroth.
I can't give you what's here. We'll take out Sephiroth.I guess this is our last meeting.
These guys are pretty tough.
...Elena, don't act so weak.
I'm not really up for it, but...
I know we have a weird relationship, but...We have to end this... like Turks!
(on defeat)Let's call it a day.
Wait, Elena.
Shinra's finished. It's come down to this.
Elena, you were a great Turk!
Farewell. If we both survive...If we can save our lives...
