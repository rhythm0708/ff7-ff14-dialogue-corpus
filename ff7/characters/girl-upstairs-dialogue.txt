Mako energy's made things a lot more convenient......But seems like a lot of plants and animals have been disappearing at a rapid pace.I think the old life was better.Don't you think so?
Yeah, sure I'm right! You think so, don't you?
That sounds just like what my mom says.
I thought things were better when I was able to play with animals......
I can't believe Meteor's really falling this way...... What's going to happen to us?
