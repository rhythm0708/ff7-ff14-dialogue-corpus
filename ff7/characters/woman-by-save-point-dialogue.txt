This is the fabled [Save Point]!!At a [Save Point] you can use a [tent] and/or select "SAVE".There's more, too. Look for something called secret.Even if you are wiped out, if you save you can restart from that same point.That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out.This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar...Once you get the world map, you can save anywhere you like. Remember that.
