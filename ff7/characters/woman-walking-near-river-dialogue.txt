Life is just like the flowing of a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it.Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see.Yuffie? I saw her a while ago. She must be in one of the houses around here.
Materia is like Life. They both come from the large ocean of life, and both must return to it.
Life is like the dew on the leaves of the trees. Whether that planet falls or not is no more than a fleeting glimmer.
