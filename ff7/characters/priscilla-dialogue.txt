He-y! Mr. Dolphin!My name is......Pri-scil-la!Now you say it.
I don't believe you! Get out of here!
Be careful Mr. Dolphin!
Uh... ugh...
Umm... thanks for helping...I'm sorry, I mistook you for one of those Shinra, Inc. ...
I'll give you something SPECIAL!It's an amulet. Take good care of it, ok?
I heard they're rehearsing the reception for the new Shinra president.
Grandpa and grandma told me this beach was beautiful when they were small.But after the Shinra built that city above, the sun stopped shining here, and the water got polluted...I was raised on that story and hate Shinra so much, I could die!
No! No! There's a high voltage current running underneath the tower. Don't wander near it, it's dangerous!But... you might be able to if Mr. Dolphin helps you. Follow me!
Wait a minute.
Pretty cool, huh? When I blow this whistle, Mr. Dolphin jumps for me.Here!! This is for you, Cloud!
Just go into the water, blow this whistle, and Mr. Dolphin'll jump you to the top of the pole!
See that rod sticking out at the top? If you jump just right, you can climb to the top of the town.
You wanna jump with Mr. Dolphin?
Come back whenever you want to see Mr. Dolphin!
No... that tickles...No... Stop......Mr. Dolphin......
Who are you---?Lifestream?Yeah, I know! It's Mr. Dolphin's playground.There's a Three-taloned island south of the continent. I heard the Lifestream runs below that island.But why are you asking about the Lifestream?
Huh, Cloud!?Hurry up and help him!! He's very important to me.
Who are you---?
I'm so happy!! Someday I'm going to be Cloud's wife.I've decided I'm gonna be Cloud's wife.
Who are you---?Cloud!!Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the Lifestream?
You've gotta be more careful! Because you're going to marry me one day.
