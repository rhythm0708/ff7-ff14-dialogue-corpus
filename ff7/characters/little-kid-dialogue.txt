Alright, alright, alright! I know!On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!A girl with materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing Da-chao for some time now.You know I've noticed that there's  pounding noise from time to time in this store.
Alright, alright, alright! I saw an old man in flashy clothes running towards Da-chao!He was babblin' somethin' and looked like he could float! It almost bowled me over!
Alright, alright, alright! I know!On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!Why Da-chao? Alright, alright, alright! I don't know!
When that big star bashes into us, both Wutai and Da-chao are going to be dust! Can't we do something?
