Sir!It's all right, Rude! I know you don't like speeches, so don't force it!
I'm the newest member of the Turks, . Thanks to what you did to Reno, we're short of people....Although, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks, ...In any case, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed.And to try and stop you every step of the way.Wait a minute, it's the other way around... You're the ones that are getting in our way.
Mr. Tseng!?
Sorry... Tseng.
Oh! Right!Very well, Rude and I will go after Sephiroth, who's heading for Junon Harbor!
Oh! I'm, I'm sorry...
The minute you think the job's boring, you guys start messing around.
It's so stupid!They always talk about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is different.Ah! Oh no!
Then, we're counting on you. I'll report to Tseng!
Yy, you!? How did you get here...?
Ww, what?
We're taking our vacation and resting up from our work.
B, but...
...sorry...
Hmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight!The next time we meet I won't be so nice.
Reno, do you think that was really such a good idea!?I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk would act!?
Rude...?
Well, I don't buy that! Goodbye!!
H......hey! Let go of me! You're gonna regret this!!
He... hey, I'm one of the 'Turks'! Don't think you can get away with this!?
Eyaaaah...!
Oh, thank you very much...!I never expected you'd to come help......
Y... Yes, sir!
Was that the company?
Tseng, what's this? Can we find the Promised Land with this?
Be careful, Tseng.
Th... Thank you very much.If I may be excused...
There they are, hurry!!
Cloud... huff... wheeze.I won't let you go any further!
It's a SE-CR-ET.It really doesn't matter! But you really got guts doin' my boss in like that!
No! Don't think you can fool me, liar!
Don't try to act innocent. I'll never forget it!!
Looks like talking alone won't cut it. You're going to have to feel some pain!
No, I can handle him! There's no way he can avoid my punch.
Why? Why didn't you try to avoid it...There's no way they can climb the Great Glacier anyway.Put them in some house in the village.
Oh no! They're here!
What are we going to do!? I think it's okay for you to ignore your orders now.
...Yes, sir. You're right.
Our orders were to seek you out and......Kill.Our company may be in turmoil, but an order's an order.That's the will and spirit of the Turks! Believe it!
What are you doing! Let's go!
Try this on for size!Yeow! That hurts!Take THAT!!
You showing pity!? Don't take the Turks for fools!
Reno! You're not violating the order... are you!?
Rude...
......
Remember the spirit of the Turks...!
