Tifa, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago.Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only person that we couldn't get a hold of was Cloud.But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway.Well, enough about him.Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so behind on everything... so out of it.Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean.Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some money....but, to do that, I guess I have to find a job first. That's right. I still haven't found a job yet.I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with Shinra, Inc.I wonder if it's too late to go back. Sometimes I think I should've taken over my parents' store.
I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is Nibelheim.Hey, Tifa... Is that stupid old water tower still working?Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked?And most of all, how are you, Tifa? It feels like I haven't seen you for years.We were all talking about you last night.Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I couldn't very well stab them in the back.I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being jilted.Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter!So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again.P.S. Write me back, okay?
I must get rid of all those that stand in the way of my research. Even that one from the Turks.I scientifically altered him, and put him to sleep in the basement. If you want to find him, then search the area.But... this is merely a game I thought of. It is not necessary for you to participate if you don't want to.
