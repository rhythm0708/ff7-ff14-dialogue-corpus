That five-storied pagoda over there is called the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods...The Five Gods are Power, Speed, Magic, War and Omni, who has the best characteristics of everything.Since ancient times, we in Wutai, have worshipped Da-chao and the Water God.Legend has it that the village has been protected by Da-chao, the Water God, and the Five Mighty Gods.But in the last battle, we didn't fare so well... I guess our beliefs were based on nothing more than legends.
Have you ever heard the story of the scales of the Water God?They're not just regular scales. They have special hidden powers. And are impervious to the strongest flames.But of course I don't think they'd stand up to the fire that huge eerie-lookin' Planet's gonna make when it crashes into us...
