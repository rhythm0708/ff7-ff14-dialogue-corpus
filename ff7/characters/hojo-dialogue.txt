As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference is 18%.
Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter.That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create one that could withstand our research for a long time.
That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong... and yet has her weaknesses.
Yes. We're starting right away. Raise it to the upper level.
My precious specimen...
Aeris? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?
Outsiders......
There's so many frivolous things in this world.
Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should.The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could operate it? Hmm?
That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before you make any rash moves.Now, bring in the Specimen!
Lending a helping hand to an endangered species... Both of them are on the brink of extinction...If I don't help, all these animals will disappear.
Stop!!
Wh... what are you do-- Oh! My precious specimens...
This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen!
I'm busy right now.
Heh heh heh...... All right. You sure are loud.Long time no see, Cloud.
Sometimes you just gotta do something like this.
It should be obvious, I'm getting a tan.
Hmm! I believe we're both after the same goal.
Did you see him?
I see...... Ha! Ha!
Nothing. I just remembered a certain hypothesis......Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you?Or that you had to visit some place?......
I see...... This could be interesting.Were you in SOLDIER? .......Heh heh heh! Would you like to be my guinea pig?
Oh, now what? Are you going to draw your sword?
Ha! Ha! Ha!......
Your mother? Oh, you mean Ifalna.How is she?
......I see.
......mumble... mumble... head west......
..................
Heh, heh, heh...... I've been searching for you, Ifalna... or should I say, Cetra!Long time no see, Professor Gast!
Believe me, I had to turn over a stone or two to find you.Two years I waited... That's how much I wanted this new sample...... Ha, ha, ha.
Hmm, Aeris? What a nice name...... Ha, ha, ha.
I'll need all of you for my experiment.You understand don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the future of the Planet!
Please don't put up a fight. I don't want any harm to come to my precious sample.Mmm? What a funny looking camera. Guard! Destroy it!
Be careful with her!! Ha, ha, ha......
Oh, and uh... don't forget the child!Hmm, a video? The Ancients... Weapon!?Heh, heh, heh... a mountain of treasure! Thank you Professor... Ha, ha, ha
Heh heh heh......That land is no one's.It's where the Reunion will take place...... They will all gather here......I wonder if we'll see...... Sephiroth?
There is no such thing as the Promised Land. it's a legend... an old wives tale...... it's utterly ridiculous.
Weapon...Then it really does exist... I didn't believe in it.
...Weapon. Monsters created by the Planet.It appears when the Planet is in danger, reducing everything to nothingness.That's what was stated in Professor Gast's report.
Here, right here.
Ha, ha, ha... this is perfect!!!It means that my experiment was a complete success.What number were you? Huh? Where is your tattoo?
What the--? You mean only a failure made it here?
Shut up, miserable failure...
...He's a Sephiroth-clone I created after the real Sephiroth died five years ago.Jenova cells and Mako, with my knowledge and skills, have been combined with science and nature to bring him to life....I'm not wild about the failure part, but the Jenova Reunion Theory has now been proven.You see, even if Jenova's body is dismembered, it will eventually become one again. That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion.I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have passed, and now the Clones have begun to return.I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where Jenova is stored.But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself began to move away from the Shinra Building.But being a genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it was all Sephiroth's doing.Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the Lifestream; he wants to manipulate the Clones himself.
I wondered where the clones were going, but I was never able to figure it out.
The one thing that I did know was that Sephiroth was at their final destination.
Did you see it!! It's Sephiroth! So he IS here!This is perfect! Both Jenova's Reunion and Sephiroth's will!They won't be diffused into the Lifestream,but gathered here! Mwa, haa, ha,......
She and I are both scientists!!
Ha, ha, ha...... Just you wait, Sephiroth.I'll give you all the Mako you want.
Ha, ha, ha...... One or two Midgars? ...it's a small price to pay.
Show me...... Sephiroth.It should be near...Ha, ha, ha...... Go beyond the powers of science...Before your presence, science is powerless...I hate it, but I'll concede to it.Just... let me see it.Ha, ha, ha......
Oh... the failure.
Every time I see you, I...It pains me that I had so little scientific sense...I evaluated you as a failed project.But, you are the only one that succeeded as a Sephiroth-clone.Heh, heh, heh...... I'm even beginning to hate myself.
(pausing)...nonsense?Oh, this?
Quit asking me why, you moron.Hmm... actually, you might be cut out to be a scientist.
Ha, ha, ha... Although he doesn't know.Ha, ha, ha... HA, HA, HA...!!What will Sephiroth think when he finds out I'm his father?Always looking down on me like that.HA, HA, HA...!!
Ha, ha, ha...I offered the woman with my child to Professor Gast's Jenova Project.When Sephiroth was still in the womb, we took the cells of Jenova...HA, HA, HA!!
Heee, hee, hee, hee! No you're wrong!It's my desire as a scientist! Heee, hee, hee, hee!
I... was defeated by my desire to become a scientist.I lost the last time as well.I've injected Jenova's cells into my own body!Heee, hee, hee!Here are......Heee, hee, hee!...my results!!
Gwah, haw, haw!!Haw... now let's seehow the Mako juice is reacting?
