Ahoy! Hey ain't you a beaut. This here's Mideel. It's a quiet little Hot Springs town.Just the perfect place for old folks like us to live out our lives.I hear that things ain't so peaceful on the outside. But here it's still nice and quiet.
Ahoy! This here's Mideel. A quiet Hot Springs town... At least it used to be...Lately the sea's been in a tizzy. Lifestream has been mixin' things up at the bottom of the ocean.I think the planet's pretty angry too. We've pretty much done whatever we've wanted to the planet up till now.
Ahoy! This here's Mideel. As you can see, this used to be a quiet hot springs town.Everything's gone now but in a way, I'm kinda glad everything's cleaned out. Feels better this way, ho, ho.
