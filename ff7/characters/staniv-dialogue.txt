So even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had to fight, Chekhov.
First, Chekhov will keep you company...
So this IS the average person's limit...
This should be interesting...! It's been a long time since I've had a chance to use my powers to their fullest...
If it were not for Miss Yuffie, I wouldn't be facing him...
HAAAAH!
The rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your opponent... Although it's a five-storied pagoda, the fourth floor is the highest...In other words, no one has ever defeated me--Master of Weaponry!You still want to try...?
I like you! Now watch...Weapon Change!
You don't seem like the kind of person who can make it to the fourth floor without a problem...
How unfortunate! It was over before I could even put all of my strength into it...
Wh, what...!?
You have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to face HIM......!
......
But, Lord Godo. The Leviathan Materia should only be given to the person who conquers and takes over this Pagoda. That is our custom...
Lord Godo...
Miss Yuffie. Your feelings for Wutai are the same as Lord Godo's. Always remember that...
