Hmm? You from Shinra?
Geez... Big-headed young kid.
I'm the town's... ...... ......!?Aren't you Cloud?Don't you know me?
Right. I'm Tifa's father....I want you to stay away from my daughter.We don't need the Shinra's help to protect our town!
If I knew this was going to happen, I would've made mountain climbing off limits...
Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens...
I hate myself for asking you this, but...Don't take your eyes off of Tifa! Hurry up and go back to her side!
Until we know that there's no danger, we're not moving.
Cloud! Why'd you bring Tifa to a place like this!What the hell's the matter with you!?What if she dies!?
