Never seen your face 'round here before. Goin' up?
Heh heh! You sure got guts!
You don't seem to understand how things work down here.This is the Gold Saucer's garbage dump. And that makes alluv ya scrubs.The only way to get back up there is to win the Chocobo Race.But, it's not as easy as you rookies think.Of course, if you got the boss's permission it'd be a different story but, YOU'll never get that!Ha ha ha ha.
You want somethin'?
Like I told you before, you gotta get the Boss' permission, then win the Chocobo......
Yeah, bull--!!
R, right.Did you kill Dyne?You must've. Or you'd never be holding that thing....So Dyne's dead... Maybe now, the place'll calm down a little.Dyne didn't care who anyone was......
R... ri...... right! I mean, no, I DON'T know anything. S, s... sorry.
Huh? Oh man, you guys are mistaken.I already told you, there's only one way to get outta here.That's to win the Chocobo Race and that's held up there, in the Gold Saucer.And, only one racer can go up at a time.
Noooo! Really, even if you threaten me!!A rule's a rule. I can't change it.If I do, the whole system down here'll get messed up!! An' I can't do that!Okay, ok, I'll let one go up there. After that, he's gotta deal with Dio.
Have you decided?All you need now is a manager....and register and get a Chocobo...
Ester?
Well, I have nothing against it, but...This is Ester. She may look kinda funny...But there's no better manager in the races...
All right then, Cloud.I'll send you up the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the details.
