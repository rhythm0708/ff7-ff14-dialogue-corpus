Did you hear?
Oh, well excuse ME!
There's a news update. They say that there was a terrorist explosion up above, and that this time it was a Mako Reactor!!You know what this means?
Oh, well excuse ME!
Ya see, I keep on top of these things, an' if ya ask me......If you knock out Midgar's power, then all of its computers and signals are going to be knocked out too.Financially there must've been about a billion gil worth of damage.An' that ain't all!! A lotta innocent people got killed too!If the explosion had been in the middle of the night, that woulda been one thing. At least the people coulda gone in their sleep.This Mako explosion has really sent Midgar into a fit.
Did you hear?
About that little girl named Tifa and that bar called '7th Heaven'.I'm not only informed, I'm kinda nosey too. Anyhow, I got the scoop.You wanna hear?
That Barret and three of his henchmen are like this sometimes.Suddenly, they threw out a customer and start talking trash to him. It's strange, if you ask me. And that place always smells like gun powder.It's dangerous, I tell you. They must be doing terrible things in there.
Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one!
Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one!
Yesterday, everyone in town was peeking at the two of you from outside the bar.Tifa's childhood friend. That's a good one!
Listen! If there isn't anyone to listen, what's the use of getting gossip on everyone!?Yeah, and you Mr. I-don't-care!I'll get a little more information that would poque even your interest. You wait and see!
