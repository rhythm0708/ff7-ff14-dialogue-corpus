Shall we play our hand around here?Not yet. Remember, no compromises.You're right. After all, this trip was expensive.But only your average Joes are trying to pick us up.Well, that's because we're just too beautiful and hard to approach.I guess so. Well, I envy the plain Janes.Why don't we compromise? We'll make do with what we have.Not yet. Remember, no compromises.
Why's that!?Not yet!!Eaghhh!It's your fault!What's wrong with you!?You wanna go!?Whew!!!
