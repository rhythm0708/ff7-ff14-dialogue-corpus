(after one Huge Materia mission)Oh, hello. She always stays right by his side. She must really love him.Remember, even at a time like this you can never give up hope. You've got to be strong like her.
(after both missions)She's finally beginning to look a little tired... I hope she's all right.No change in his condition, and still she stays there doing her best. It must be tough on her.If she keeps this up she'll probably get sick......
Well anyhow...... Hey, you all look terrible. Why don't you rest up for a while?
Eyaaah! I hate earthquakes!!
You probably don't remember, but you know that girl that watched over you for so long when you were sick?You'd better take care of her. If you don't, you'll be sorry. Believe you me!Well anyhow...... Hey, you all look terrible. Why don't you rest up for a while?
