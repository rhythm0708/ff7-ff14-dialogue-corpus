SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy?What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?
Biggs and I got the code for this door.
Code deciphered.
Push that button over there!
Push the [OK] button in front of a ladder to grab on to it. After that, use the [Directional button] to move up and down.
My leg got stuck.Thanks!

Alright, be careful.
OK! Now everyone get back.
Cloud......
Cloud......
Be careful, I'll shut this.
Hey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me?It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it together. I'll explain it to you.I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors... you know, flashy stuff.Okay, it's about to start.This is a complete model of the city of Midgar.It's about a 1/10000 scale.The top plate is about 50 meters above ground.A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and there are other support structures built in each section...psst... whisper... whisper (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was in the northern section.)Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor.The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity.Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them.Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's the kind of place this is.Phew..., this is next! Look.This is the route this train is on.The route spirals around the main support structure.We should be coming around the center area, right now.At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up.It can check the identities and backgrounds on each and every passenger on the train by linking it up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters.whisper... whisper... (Anyone could tell that we look suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)
Speak of the devil...That light means that we're in the ID Security Check area....whisper... whisper... (When the lights go off, you never know what kind of creeps'll come out.)...anyhow, we're almost back now. That's a relief.
I know! Next time, I'll give you one I made myself.
Oh yeah, you might regret it. I'm the type who takes things personal.
Okay, then I'll put a little extra effort in and make it with a BANG.
We're almost there. After talking with you, I really want to do it!I think you've lit my fuse!
Careless...... You're getting all excited.Wonder what for......?
Oops...Hey, look at the news... What a blast.Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was just make it like the computer told me.Oh no! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere.Hey, that was my bomb's debut. Makes me kinda proud.
Money...Oh my. It must have been for a lot of it.Sure! Well, what the hell? It's a verbal agreement. Now let me figure this out.Oh stop it, Cloud! Did you hear me?
We're in trouble.I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!
Just run!Changing to Plan 2!
Not yet. They're starting another check. If we're caught, we're done for!But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should get past it!
It's me, . How do I look, Cloud?Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?
Yay!! I'm so happy ...I think?
You're right, sorry.
I'm sorry.The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault.I made your ID card special...... So that's why it happened...I put my heart into making it. But I failed.Next time, I'll give you something more decent.I'll be back at the hideout in my research room workin' on it.
...Cloud... I'm glad...... I could talk with you... one last time.
That's... all right...Because... of our actions... many...... people died...... this probably...... is our punishment...
...Is... that so......?Ha...... cool...... as usual... ex-...SOLDIER. ...always... I liked that... in you...
