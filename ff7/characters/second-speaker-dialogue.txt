...whisper... whisper... (We have a luncheon with President Shinra...)
Psst...... (I can't tell him......)
Psst...... (I'm so disgusted with the President.)
Psst... (What're you complaining about. You're just holding the lights. I've gotta wear this heavy armor!)
Psst...... (Ha, ha...... No way, that's the first I've heard of it.)
Geez!! Mr. President!! I mean, Your Majesty......
Ohhh...... I'm sorry. Please remove the ancient curse!
Psst... (How many times IS this?)
