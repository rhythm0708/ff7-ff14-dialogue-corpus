They probably told you at the entrance, but most of the attractions at Gold Saucer only take 'GP'.They don't sell GP. You can only get 'em from the Wonder Square games or at the Chocobo Races.
Am I boring you?
If you go further North, I heard there's a Huge Crater.Something huge must've fallen from the sky a long time ago!
