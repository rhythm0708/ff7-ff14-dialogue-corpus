Welcome. Please take your time.
Umm, it might take a little time. Will that be all right?
Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You see, he makes all the dresses.
He's probably plastered at the bar.
Yes, I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble.!You'd help me bring him back?
Really!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what to do anymore...
So how did it go?
Looks like everything went well. He's been making the dress ever since he came back.
So? Were you able to get the wig?
Looks like you got it. So try it on for size.
Yeah, you're right. Should we try it?Thanks for showing us something new. My father's got his motivation back now, So the dress is on the house.
How's this?
Father, what are you talking about? This one's much better.
(to Cloud)...Hmm. It's REALLY somethin'.
