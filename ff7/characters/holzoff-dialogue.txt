Now, this is a surprise!!How many years has it been since I last saw anyone here...?Oh, excuse me! My name is . I've lived here for 20 years now.You mind listening to the stories of a lonely climber?Why don't we go to the next room and sit down.
You awake?You collapsed at the Great Glacier. It's a miracle you're all right.
My name is . I've been living here 20 years now.If you are planning to head North, you'd better listen to my story.Why don't we go to the next room and sit down.
You ever hear about those who challenged the cliff?
The first time my friend Yamski and I tried to climb the cliff was 30 years ago.
There's an old legend that says something fell from the sky here a long time ago.That's what's supposed to have pushed the land up and formed this cliff.30 Years ago, Yamski and I took this cliff on to see what was on the other side.
But, we weren't prepared for it. We did expect the temperature to be low but...On that cliff, there's always a biting cold wind. The cold air lowers your body temperature.Yamski, was below me. He cut his own rope......and I didn't even notice...Ever since then, I've settled here... continuing to challenge the cliff, and provide warning and shelter to my fellow climbers.If you're going to climb the cliff, there's 2 precautions you'll need to take.First, check your route... It's hard to find because of all the snow.Second, once you get to a ledge, make sure you warm yourselves up.Understand?
You must've used a lot of energy getting up here... Better get some rest before you head out.
To climb this cliff you must check your route.And you have to keep your body temperature normal. Don't forget these things.Like to rest a little?
(if Cloud answers no)Don't over do it.
It's dangerous past the cliff because of the Barrier!It's better not to go anywhere near it!!Like to rest a little?
(if Cloud declines)Don't over do it.
Look we can't go to the cliff! So just give it up!!
