Actually, I'm a beautiful maid. I just work here in the accessory store part-time.Everything here can compare with the best goods anywhere. So, how about one?Thank you. Stop by again.
Oh great. Now I've got to find another job......I guess I might as well make my side job as an accessory seller into my regular job.Well, since you're already here, why don't you buy something to take back with you?Thank you. Stop by again.
