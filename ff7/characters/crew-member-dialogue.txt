Oh...... oh...... Cloud......
Cloud, I was deeply moved by your story!I'm really a weak person and so I could really understand how you feel, Cloud!No one knows when fighting will begin. But let's get ready!
My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!Oh, yeah, yeah. Are you using Chocobos?I mean, just loading them up and transporting them.
It's a strange signal!
(turning towards Cait Sith)It's coming from this... person(?)
I wonder what everyone's going to do when this fight's over?I wonder what's gonna happen to the Highwind...?
Take care!
Welcome! Everyone's waiting for you.
