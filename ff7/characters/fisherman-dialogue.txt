Ever since... Shinra built that city up above during the war, ...ugh, ugh.There's been no fish in the water! It got so polluted... phew...
There's a dolphin in the bay. If you get close enough and blow the whistle, it might come to you.If you want to get on the ship, why not have the dolphin take you?
Once Meteor hits, not just the fish, but the whole ocean will be destroyed...
It seems like there's something going on again up there.Is that huge plane going to take off again with that deafening roar?
