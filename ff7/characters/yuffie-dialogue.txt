Haa----ah! Gotcha! And you deserve it, too!
Man...... I can't believe I lost...
You spikey-headed jerk! One more time, let's go one more time!
I won't lose this time! Take your time and get ready. Holler when you're ready!
No way I'm going to fight with punks like you more than once!I'll keep enough for the doctor bill! Next time, you won't be as lucky!
Thinkin' of running away? Stay and fight! FIGHT, I said!C'mon...... What's the matter?You're pretty scared of me, huh!?
Hmm, just as I thought. What do you expect with my skills?Good luck to you guys too. If you feel up to it, we can go another round. Later!I'm really gonna leave! REALLY!
Oh yeah? Then do whatever you want!
What is it, you still have somethin' for me?......Hmmm. So is that it?I know you want my help because I'm so good!You want me to go with you?
What, you still want somethin'?...Hmm. So is that it?You want my help 'cause I'm so good!You want me to go with you! Is that what you're saying?
Heh heh... thought so. You put me in a spot. Hmm, what should I do?But if you want me that bad, I can't refuse...
Me? The name's......
What are you talking about!? You're the one who should go first!Okay forget it! I'm not going with you!Remember, if you piss me off... it'll cost you!!
Huh? Hey...HEY!Wait! I haven't even told you my name......I'm ! Good to meetcha!
Oh yeah? Then do whatever you want!
Wh... what!?Uuuuugh! Now I'm really mad!Make fun of me, will ya! Just watch!!
The Shinra? Here too?
Is this about the jewels?
Look close, old man.
I'm certain there must be state-of-the-art materia inside the reactor. Am I right?
Special materia, huh? Well, well, things are getting interesting.
If things go right, we might even be able to pray to that special materia.
Okay, it's settled. We're gonna get the materia, right?
We may have lost the materia.
Okay, it's settled. We're gonna get the materia, right?
Come on... break time, break time!
Hey watch your mouth! We hate the Shinra!
Whoa, Gawd!
Do it, Cloud!
Wanna rest?
What's this loud music? It's giving me a headache!
Aren't you going to follow her?
Urrrgh... This is why... I hate ships.Hey, Cloud. You have any 'Tranquilizers'?
Thanks... Gross... this is bitter.
...unless it's an emergency get away from me.
Where are the others?I dunno. Aren't they hiding somewhere around here?How should I know...? Ugh...... urk......
(backing away)N, not me...I don't even like Sephiroth anyway. And besid...... ugh...... urk......
I told you... I don't want... to, ugh...... urk......
Ov...... over there!!
Eeeew! What IS it! GROSS!
Gag... I'm feeling sick as it is without you having to show me THIS...
He was mumbling something about time!
So what's the story?Hey Cloud. Give us a quick run down.
Phew... We're finally here... Now we gotta hide......
Yeah, mine, too!!
Don't bother looking for me!
Ah, Cloud! Let me make a buck why don't you?I'm sellin' Materia. Why don't you buy some!?
Knock it off, Cloud! Look I don't know, but he knows a lot of stuff, right?
Oh gawd, what a drag!!
I'm pooped!
Yeow! What a rock!!
Come to mommy!!
You kiddin'?
I'm not sympathizing with Barret! He never should have trusted Shinra, Inc. ...
I'm waiting inside.
With me!?
Cloud!Let's go together, Cloud!
What is it?
Wow!Geez!!Cloud!Oh my gawd!Geez!
What is it! Tell us!
Huh?
He's weird! Cloud, don't let him come!
Cloud! Are we just going to leave the others?
Wh... why?
Don't, don't just leave me!
Wow, that's somethin!!
Hey, you okay?
Hey? Isn't that guy, Barret?
Hey, Cloud! Just leave him alone.I mean, he told us to, didn't he? Then that's that, right?
You sure are all acting pretty heroic, considerin' we're not makin' any money on this...
Well, Cloud go get 'em!
I don't like this! It's like the whole world knows where we're going.
Maybe it's someone in this group?
Hmmm... Any Materia? Any Materia around?
Rest, rest, rest! I wanna rest! There! It's decided!
Oh man! This place looks like a real drag. And their Materia sucks, too.
God. I HATE studying!
Woa! Wooooah! Pretty good, surprisin' me!
Wh, what the? A shooting star?
Whew!!
What a boring place, just like I thought. I wanna go somewhere! Let's go find some Materia!
Does he want to show him THAT? You know, maybe there's some Materia that's been passed on for generations in this Canyon!?
What the...!?
I heard from someone that this town was gone!
What happened?
Man, you really WERE having a bad dream! Even I feel bad!
Oh, that's okay. It was probably depressing anyway.
OK. Boring story no. 1.
Huh? Oh great just what I needed...
Cloud, let's steal it! I love stealing from the Shinra!
I'm !
Man, this sucks...!
What's his prob!? I'm gonna go clean that guy's clock!!
No!! It's gonna take off!
Whatever!
.........Hm. How 'bout goin' west?No, no reason. NO reason at all!
Wait, wait, wait, wai----t!!
I know this area pretty well.It gets pretty tough past here. Better get ready...
No! It's REALLY tough...
I didn't know! I have nothing to do with this one!
No, umm, uh......
Hey!!
This is MY house! Nobody gets in!
What's with you, you coward!
You scared of the Shinra?Then why don't you fall into line and obey them, just like all of the other towns!
You get beaten once, and then that's it?What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?
That's my style! And it's my own business, not yours! Don't you try and dictate what I should do!
Hmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!!
......
O... ok, I know... I was wrong......You win. I'll give you back your materia...
I know, the materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. ...Follow me.
...I've been hearing that ever since I was little.Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more important...You saw what it looks like now, right? ...JUST a resort town...After we lost the war, we got peace, but with that, we lost something else. Now look at Wutai...That's why... if I had lots of materia I could...
I know. I know that...That... sniff... switch... the lever on the left...... materia's... sniff, hic... in there.
Ha ha ha------! Never trust anyone that easily!! / Ha ha------! You should've listened!!The Materia's mine! Tough!You want your materia? Then go find it yourself!Yeah that's right. And when you're looking for the materia, remember you gotta steel it.Heh heh... steel... steel! Get it?C ya!!
Let go! I SAID let GO!Hey! Who do you think I...... OW! What're you doin'...? Jerk!
LET... ME...... GO!!!!
Oh GAWD! If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've taken rope escape lessons more seriously!!
GROSS-NESS!Don't mess with me old man! You don't even have any Materia!
Oh man! Cloud......!
Makes me so MAD...!
Hey---who cares about that!? Get----me-----down----!
Phew, perfect. Now the materia is back in its rightful place.
Huh? Oh, it'll be all right...Don't be so picky!Anyways, that sure was close......No, normally I would kick their butts, Boom, Bang!!
I'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy.
Oh, by the way, some of those guys from the Turks are good, huh?At least, after all that, we got the materia back.Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey...
.........Come on, wait---!
- Yeah, that's it- No way!
Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Of course!
Who's next?
What? I gotta fight a punk?
Wh, what did you say!?
Now watch...!
- Stop yappin'!- I'll forgive you
Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Of course!
That ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength of youth!
- I got insurance- Let's get this over with, old bag
Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Of course!
- Just come on!!- I'll pass!
Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Of course!
D, ...Dad!?
Why, why are you......
H... hey!
Dammit......
I'll show you this time, you old Fart-meister!
...heave...... heave...
O... old coot... n...... ot... bad...
Hah... Ha, ha......
Ha ha haaaaaa......!
CUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM... I'm so sick of hearing that!It's so stupid!
Then what 'bout the rest of you? You have all that power...Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?
You too, dad...! Just because you lost the war!And turning Wutai into a place like this!
You turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to tourists...How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!!
Wh, what did you say...!?
......
Dad...
......Of course!
Dad...!
Heh, heh... you bet!
I'll show you my moves!
What!? That's it? I'm goin' to bed!
Cloud you up?
Would you...... keep me company for a bit.
Just come on.
Cloud, let's go.
I don't know what it's all about but sounds kind of cool. Wanna try it, Cloud?
Please help me...Legendary hero!...Was that good?
Cloud... I mean, Alfred...
What...?...That's it?
Come on, Cloud!! I'm tryin' to be serious here and you...Ok, now I'm pissed!
Just shut up!!
Please help me...Legendary hero!...Was that good?
What...?...That's it?
Come on, Cloud!! I'm tryin' to be serious here and you...Ok, now I'm pissed!
Just shut up!!
Come on, Cloud!! I'm tryin' to be serious here and you...Ok, now I'm pissed!
Just shut up!!
Please help me...Legendary hero!...Was that good?
Cloud... I mean, Alfred...
What...?...That's it?
What...?...That's it?
Please help me...Legendary hero!...Was that good?
What...?...That's it?
Come on, Cloud!! I'm tryin' to be serious here and you...Ok, now I'm pissed!
Just shut up!!
Come on, Cloud!! I'm tryin' to be serious here and you...Ok, now I'm pissed!
Just shut up!!
I didn't get it. Cloud, let's go on the Gondola next.
There will be two of us.
(sitting backwards to lean out the window)Wow!Geez!!Cloud!
(scratching her head)I just felt like doing that.
That's all.
H, hey!! Say something, why don't you!!
......gawd, I could just die.
Say something, PLEASE!
I'll think I'll sleep really well tonight.Thanks... for coming with me.
You wanna go back, Cloud?
Hey, isn't that Cait Sith? What's he doing?
Is it all right to relax like that? Aren't we going after Cait Sith?
Can we be wasting time like this? Aren't we going after Cait Sith?
Should we be wasting time like this? Aren't we going after Cait Sith?
Should we be doing that? We've got to go after Cait Sith?
You got time to fool around like that? Aren't you goin' after Cait Sith?
Should we be this laid back? Aren't we going after Cait Sith?
Part of the Shinra! Who the *&$# are you!?
Sounds fishy---
Uh, yup.
I'm startin' to get nervous.
He has a tattoo too! Ummm, I think it's number 9.
Geeeez! We got our work cut out for us.This is starting to get me really dizzy...
Oh grossness!
I have nothing to do with it. But, I guess I'll lend a hand.
Oh man! I should've stayed at home.
Cloud! What are you doing?
I don't know what it is but...It looks like it's going to make a mess...
Let's just leave it and get the hell out of here!
Heh heh... this looks majorly boring, so I'll stay here.
What!? Cloud!
Aeris! Cloud, what're you doing!?
Ahhh--- I can't go another step!!We're looking for Aeris, right! Then why are you heading for the mountains!? What a dork!
How COOL! I can't believe we found such a soft bed in a dive like this.
Come on--, let's rest for a while--- I don't want to walk anymore...
Hey---, Cloud. What's your problem?
No way---! Sephiroth wasn't invited!
Wh...why? How can you tell that kind of stuff?
That means it's pretty bad... doesn't it?
Sto----p!
Why now?
Leave it to me!
Ummm... Which way did that Sephiroth guy go?
Wait! Get a hold of yourself!
God! I can't stand it!
At times like these, we need the map! Let's open it with the [] button.
Brrrr, I can't take this cold!!
Even I know what's going on. The energy's bein' gathered here to heal the gash.
Are you saying you don't like me?
I was just getting into it!
What!? You mean that wasn't Sephiroth? All that time I was following this... thing?
I don't want anything to do with that Black Materia!
Shouldn't we hurry? The real Sephiroth is still close, right?
But why Nibelheim? This is freaky, REALLY freaky!
Huh---! Cloud's not here.
I don't want to be in an illusion. Let's get back to the real world!
Wow...... I didn't know it was THIS bad...
He... hey, you! You alright!?Oh, a dream! But it felt so real...
I know you're in a hurry! But, please if I could have a word......
Don't make so much noise...... It's me, ME! !
I'll explain later! Now we gotta get to the airport!
(lying on deck)Ha! Ha! ......urk!Well...... I'm glad you're safe.I'm going to stay up here a little longer.......Urk! ......I can't ride ships either in the air or water.
BINGO!!
Oh, HEY!
You lyin' or what!?
Hey doc, is he okay? Is he gonna heal?
No lie. After fallin' head first into the Lifestream.
Yeah, that's right. Besides, WE'RE here for him. He's gotta get better!
You okay, Tifa?
You gotta do it then. You gotta live true to yourself.
No big, no big. I'll pop in again later.
Look after Cloud. Take care, Tifa.
Hey, shouldn't we be gettin' back to the Highwind?
Cid......????I know you're all dyin' to talk to a babe like me!But just leave me alone. This ship makes me...... urk...!!
Wa... wait!
What are ya gonna do!? Huge Materia!?
Pretty good for an old guy. I'm impressed you can move this thing!
What!? You serious!?
No use baggin' on yourself! It's not like you, OLD guy!
Forget about the Huge Materia, WE'RE the ones in deep trouble!
What are you doin' accelerating!?
Get serious, you old man!
I'd be sad if this place was my hometown...
We've got to hurry and stop 'em!!
You must mean Cloud...
The Shinra? Here too?
Look close, old man.
Okay, it's settled. We're gonna get the materia, right?
If we lose here, all the materia we gathered will be for nothing.
Gotta have that materia!
We gotta get there and stop 'em...
Cloud, right...?
Oh good, they're still alive.
Well, I'm just glad we're all alive.
I told you I'm not kidding!
We got to get there first and stop them......
It is you Cloud......
I swear, next time, that guy's dead meat!
Well at least the Lifestream's back to normal.
But what about Tifa and Cloud......!?
Huh?How would you even know? You don't know how tough it is... getting sick on boats and rides......So, please...... just leave me alone.
Oh......Isn't there any way to prevent this?
......so you're a little better off than me.But I don't feel...... well.Where's the next stop? Can't you get there any quicker?Cloud, put me in your party, so I can get off this ship.
Hey! A Crane Game!
I'm SURE! You want me to do manual labor?
!? The Huge Materia!
Wait a sec! What about the Huge Materia---?
I... I can't... I'm history.
HEY---! It's movin'!Oh man, this sucks!! Cloud, do something!
I'll hold my breath, so HURRY!
Oh my gawd...! They mean us.
Climbing...arrrgh...my ears...! LET ME OUT---I HATE THIS---
I wanna get outta here, now!
Phew... The air up here is great!Hey! Let's go to the airport!
...Yeah!!The submarine dock underneath Junon! I can steal sub easy enough, but forget about me piloting it!
Let's get there before they do and catch 'em!
Hey, where? Where? Where are they headed?
Hmph!......I wonder why anyone would ever make an airship like this......Ugh...... ugh......
Hey old man! Do something!
Hmm? What are we gonna do with the Huge Materia?If you don't want it, maybe... you could... give it to ME!
I can't budge it by myself!!
What? Are we there?I know it's all for Wutai, But I can't take much more of this.
My head's about to pop.
You expect me to know that? Let the others do it!
Me either! I don't get any of this!
Cloud...... urp...... ugh.You know, I was thinking...... phew...... Why does materia always have something to do with battles or magic?I bet the Ancients must've always been fighting.It must've been... ugh... terrible...
Are you waiting for Cloud?He's flying right now, so you can't get him.Were you going to force me into the submarine right now?Quit it! If you want to go, then just leave me behind.............ooooooh. What're you talking about? I......
Not I, dorkus! WE!
The hope she left us... We've gotta take a chance with it!
Huh? It's looking somewhere else. Doesn't it want to fight us?
OK, can we GO now!?
What's the pilot like?Tell him  says if he pilots the plane smoothly, give him my autograph...
Headed for... Midgar?Uh, a, anywhere's fine... I don't care. Just hurry up and land this thing.
This place smells gross. Let's get this over with!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon---!
Are you serious...?
How sad... for him...
How could you say that!?I came all the way here after being seasick as a dog!I didn't go through all that just to have you guys have the best parts all to yourselves!
Gee, Cloud...... that's so nice of you to say that. ......You sick?Well, whatever. I'm gonna be in my reserved seat in the hall...... waiting...... upp! ......Urk!
Cloud...... sign this.
It's a contract that says when the war is over, all the materia will belong to me.It's all in there. Read it carefully and then sign it, all right?
Oh yeah......?I'm the same way, so I can't say too much......Damn! My plan failed. Let's pick on Nanaki later to let off steam.
I'm going......
Oh man... 'Materia Hunter ' sounds like the last chapter of 'Materia Forever.'
Cloud, which way you goin'?
I'm goin'...
If I knew THIS was gonna happen, I'd have bailed out sooner!
I finally got here, so I'm not leaving...
......... Wh... What?
Oh, all right.Here, Cloud.
But I'm the one who found it, so you better give it back to me when you're done with it!
It feels like we made it as far as we can.
Heh heh, I'm fine with that. (It's probably more fun than fighting Sephiroth down there.)
What! What!
I, I don't know if I can... go on...
I don't like it!!Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have come...I don't need... materia...... any...Nope, I still want it!! This an' that an' everything... MINE! And I'm never gonna give any up!!
