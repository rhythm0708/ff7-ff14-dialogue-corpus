I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal!Our coal's been protected for generations. Our fathers, and theirs before them, risked their lives for it.We have no right to throw it all away so easily!
I know how you feel! I feel the same way too, damn it!But even so, I won't give away our coal mines!
Hey, Barret! It's not over yet!Everyone's waiting! Let's go back to the village!
C'mon, Barret! We gotta hurry!
Barret!! You stay here!!
Watch out!!
Yeah... I ain't lettin' go...You're comin' back... Everyone's waitin' for ya...Eleanor... and Marlene... They all waitin' on us...
Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years...A voice I'll never forget...
What's that? ......I hear her voice.
I hear her voice, Eleanor's voice. Begging me... not to hate your rotten guts.That's why I didn't hunt you down...
...Why!? The hell do you care for!?Are the people killed going to understand 'why'? Are the people of Corel going to understand just hearing Shinra's excuses?I don't CARE what the reason is!All they give us are artillery and stupid excuses... What's left is a world of despair and emptiness...
You still want to hear 'why'? ...All right, I'll tell you.'Cause I want to destroy everything.
......?
...
So...... she's still alive...All right, Barret. I guess that means you and I gotta fight.
Eleanor's alone all by herself. I've got to take Marlene to her.
Marlene wants to see her Mom, don't she?
Oh yeah? Well my life's been over ever since then.
Urgh!
I told you... I... I want to destroy everything...Everything... This crazy world... Even me...
...Think about it... Barret... How old was Marlene back then...?Even if I did go to her now... she wouldn't even know me...And what's more... Barret...These hands are a little too stained to carry Marlene anymore...
Barret...
...wow... Marlene's... already...... 4......
