GOOGAH... what do you want?Don't have... GAH... anything much but, you should be able to... GOO... rest yourselves here. GOGAH... make yourselves at home.......Yuffie? ......nope, never heard of her. ...GOOGO......you again? I told you once, and I'm telling you again, I don't know her.
Yuffie......!
Shut up! What would you know about this?
No kid like you's going to talk to me like that!You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Style...? Dictate...?Throwin' around all those fancy words... You're a miserable daughter!
......take your things and get out of here now.To protect Wutai, we cannot afford to stand up to Shinra.
...Hm. You can do it......
I'm glad you made it this far, Yuffie!
I'll answer you by having you try your skills against me!Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you don't... then I'll have to kill you!
What are you doing! OMNI-Change! ......!!
Ohhh! And what was that!? Come back when you get more training!
Hmm? A slight improvement.Come at me with all you have! OMNI-Change! ......!!
...huff...... puff......
You've...... also...... improved...
...Heh, heh......
Waha haaaaa......!
It's time I gave this to you, Yuffie...This is Leviathan Materia. Take it.
Yuffie...!
...
Yuffie!!Forgive me... It's all my fault...
Losing the war... turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault...
Silence!!Yuffie......I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war.But, after I lost the war, I began to think...Is strength, only for defeating the enemy?...or just something to show-off to others...?Might begets might.That's the same way as the Shinra...
I knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai.But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai...And now, I realize both are necessary...Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless...!
You there, please take Yuffie with you!I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!
Go, Yuffie!For the sake of strengthening Wutai!
I'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return!Go! And come back alive!
Yuffie, wait a minute.The Materia they all have...After their battle is over, you think they'll still want it?
Go! Survive till the end! And return!With the Materia!
Go! Survive to the end! And return to us!Mat-...Take care of the Materia!!
