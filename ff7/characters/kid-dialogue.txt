Damn, man!! Just forget about it!
Oh man, oh man......Go ahead 'n' help yourself to the room.

This is a slum, so don't think you can stay for free.What are you going to do?Doesn't just seeing the bed make you sleepy?
Sweet dreams, pops.
Tough guy, huh!? You'd better sleep when you can.You'd better save when you can.That's the trick to being tough. Remember that, old dude.
Ahh! Now I ain't got no one to pick on!
(standing by the door to 7th Heaven)When it comes down to it... I'm gutless. I'm still just a no good kid.
Toot toot! Next stop... Midgar Midgar.Any passengers getting off on Midgar should please ring.You know, Midgar's supposed to be sparkly 'n' springy 'n' sleeky.Oh yeah. Someday, I'm goin' there.

My dream is to grow up and become a big time dealer on wall market.
Wanna see somethin' awesome? Follow me!
Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing.
There was something glowing in that well over there.If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the Gold Saucer!
(walking in)Bugenhagen!Several odd looking people have come.
Don't worry, mom! All of us just need to go through that door!Mr. Bugenhagen sealed it so we wouldn't have to worry about it!But what's a seal...?
I got it out of the well. Isn't it an amazing rock!!
When I grow up, I'm gonna travel the world collecting glowing stones!
I got a glowing rock from the well.I'll sell it to you for 50000 gil!
Yay! My house is finished!!
I wish someone would buy this rock off of me...
SOLDIER? What about them!?Damn! If they really were from SOLDIER, they would be doing something about all this!!
What's wrong with Bugenhagen? Is he sick?
