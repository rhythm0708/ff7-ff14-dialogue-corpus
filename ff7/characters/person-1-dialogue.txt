All this trash. Can't we do anything with it?
Oh, you mean the owner who even has a tank in his shop.
Is this pile of trash getting bigger?
Right, right, you're right. The owner of the Weapons Shop scavenged all the stuff that came falling down.
Oh, you mean he went out to the Plate cross section next to the Don's Mansion, right?
Yeah! It gives me the chills.
