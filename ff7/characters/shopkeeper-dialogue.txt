What is it?
You opened up all those things without asking and, hey wait!
A rookie? Then you gotta buy something. Yup, that's the rule here.
Oh... is that so... then leave me alone and let me... yawn... sleep...
I hired more girls after hearing that the world's coming to an end, but I wonder if I made a mistake.I keep getting more and more in debt. I've got to get out from under it somehow. Maybe I'll have Weapon help me.
I used to be in SOLDIER. Recently, I've felt like dressing up like this...I don't know why, it's out of season, but...
Hey yo! Welcome!You aren't tired of my babbling?Great! Then come on in and start buying!
You're still gonna sit here and buy stuff at a time like this?You're an odd one...
Welcome! We always welcome cash! Now, about where you want to go...I'm afraid other customers have already booked it up. There's nothing left.......just kidding! Just a little joke. Now what can I do for you?Thank you! Come again!
Welcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage! What can I get you today?Thank you very much! Please come again.
Is something wrong......?
Oh... why, thank you very much.
Huh? Key? You mean the one to that door?
Hah, hah, hah! That's a good one!
Of course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.
That's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this.
If possible, we're hoping to pass through a dream door like that one into another worldI got the feeling that you all might be able to make my dreams come true in my place. Weird, isn't it?
