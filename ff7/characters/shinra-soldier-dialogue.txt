Urrrrgh... no way...... I can't go on.Things aren't working out.Between our differences and my pay, it just isn't cutting it.
Uuuuuuuh! I want flowers too! But, I get so nervous in front of cute girls...It just seems natural to get cautious...
Uurrgh! So, this is it for today, huh?
Hey, that's not them! These are the other guys from before!!
So our reports were right! He IS here on vacation!We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up!
Wh, what was that...?
We know you're off duty, but...
But you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too!
All right, that's it! We'll get him without any help from the Turks, just you see!
And don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about this!!
Now listen up! They must be in the area! Find them no matter what!
Yes, sir!!
There he is! It's Corneo! Don't let him get away!Attaaaack!
What do you want to do with him?
