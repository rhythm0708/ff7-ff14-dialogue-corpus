...wheez...Phew...
...wheez... puff... You know, Grandma...
...whew... I know our son rented this for us and all, but...It's too nice for us. Big round bed, gorgeous tub, I just can't get comfortable.
...wheez...
...wheez...Phew...Hey Grandma. What's the name of the company that our son is working for...?
...heave... Lately, it's getting worse...
Yeah, if it's the biggest company, it must be something.
Oh... thanks to our son we're able to live in a room like this.
Well, you wanna go to sleep...?
Good night.
...snore... snore...
Thanks to Shinra, Inc. developing Mako energy for us, everything's more convenient now.Maybe a little too convenient.
Did you say you came from Midgar?I used to live there, too. But I hear they got lots of troubles lately.
Whew!!Hey!You're actually talking to me.
I just passed a guy in a black cloak back there.I just tried to tell him that it's dangerous up ahead, and he ignored me!
It's dangerous up ahead. Be careful on your way.If any strangers should greet you warmly while traveling, make sure to greet them back.Whew! I guess that's the fun of being on the road.
The next train's coming in soon.
............No matter how much I pray, it won't bring our grandson back...
I get so impressed every time I look at it.Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby.But, out of appreciation, let me give you this.
I wish you'd take care of it and use it...
Oh, how boring...
My job's to make everyone laugh all over the world...Hmm, let's see... do I know any good jokes...?
Well, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see... what was your name?
Oh, how exciting. You a friend of my grandson's?
You've already fought x times... ......zzzzz....... zzzzzzzz......Come on. You already escaped x times. ......zzz...... zzzzzzzzz......Large materia needs high level materia............ zzzzzz...... zzzzzzzz......
What're you groping around for!..................zzzzz......... zzz.......
Who're you?Hmph. I guess it was fate that I woke up and met you. Here!
Because those Shinra creeps locked us up in our houses, we couldn't even watch the rocket lift off.I never thought that my only hobby would be destroyed by that arrogant young Rufus...!
...smack... mff... Oh... welcome, glad you came.
(on speaking to him again)You'll have a hard time selecting from all the good things we have!
Ah, youth... You really believe that big meteor filling up the sky's going to fall here?If that's the case then all we can do is put our hope in Shinra, Inc.
The next train's coming in soon.
You lost? When that happens the only ones you can count on are your friends.The first thing you gotta do is find your best friend.
Shinra's trying to gather the Huge Materia from Corel and Fort Condor. There are four left, and they're transporting them here.I can't stand the thought of them using my rocket for something like this.Anyways.How 'bout it? Want to look at the rocket with me?
It seems like there's a lot happenin' in the outside world, but as long as I got this rocket... I'm satisfied.
Oh, how boring...
Oh, you know lately things have been like that. You can even see the moon in the afternoon. Everyone's celebrating.
Ancient Weapon? End of the world? I don't know nothing about that! I'm gonna live to be a hundred!There's tons of stuff I still gotta do! This's just the beginning.And what have Shinra and SOLDIER done about it? Tell me! They're a waste!!
It was really sad...... but weird. He was holding this really long sword.I dunno. The whole thing feels unlucky to me. But the amazing thing was those weird blue eyes......
Yeah, poor kid...... He must've drifted from somewhere pretty far away...
This reactor's useless, but I hear there's still big materia at the Corel, Fort Condor, and the Junon reactors.Shinra's working to get the materia from all those places...... But for what...?
What the? Don't get hit by the train!
Um... where was the next train station?
So how is the boy? Poor kid. He sure got the worst of whatever it was......Sure hope he gets better soon. Right now is when he really needs to hold on and not give up.
There's a bunch of Shinra people here messin' with the rocket...Is my rocket... all right?
Hey Cid! I just thought of the best joke! Listen to this one.
Uh, now, let's see, how did it go......He's crude an' a jerk...I mean, He's Rude of the Turks!
President Rufus, lathers Tantrics...Uh, I mean... President Rufus, gathers mechanics...Raunchy meat, a pocket full, at the cafeteria. Uh, I mean... Launch a beat up rocket full of Materia.
Oh, 'crap-again' (oh, captain).
How rude...
(lying on the floor)Ugh... Nice kick.
My, my precious rocket... It's gone.Hmph, I know. No matter how much I look, the rocket's still gone.But I just can't stop it. Just call it an old man's folly if you will.Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby.But, out of appreciation, let me give you this.
I wish you'd take care of it and use it...Maybe it's time for me to get a new hobby...Mmm. You know that Shinra sports car at Cid's house? It might be fun to try and restore that thing...
I got to learn more... Devotion, devotion.
Everyone at Shinra's in an uproar because they heard Weapon's coming.I heard a big hydroplane carrying secret weapons, got attacked by Weapon and was sunk at sea......
Shinra's tried a lot of things, but it's only HUMAN. It's fate that Meteor will kill the people.
Ah, youth... You really believe that big meteor filling up the sky's going to fall here?If Shinra, Inc was our last hope, and they've been beaten by terrorists...... Are we all going to die?
If something ever happened to President Rufus, That'd be the end of Shinra, Inc...... and the rest of the world, too.
