Oh Jesus!! What the hell's wrong tonight!!I thought that long blackout was strange.They say a Mako Reactor was destroyed above.I was jes sittin' here drinkin', watchin' the news by myself.'n' all of a sudden I get kicked outta the &*%$ store. What's up with that!?I wasn't even done with my drink. I didn't even pay my bill...
There's a TV in there, but my cheap aunt won't let me in the house. Look for yourself.
Now that you mention it, there used to be an outside TV monitor here in the slums.But that Barret, busted it up.Shot it up with that weird machine gun hand of his. Blam, blam, blam.I think it was when President Shinra was on.He was on again this morning, too, you know.Tifa better watch out for her TV.
I hope he doesn't get hurt.That worries me the most.
Ah... Johnny's gone. You look a little disappointed.I don't like to say it myself but, I'm just a lonely guy when I'm not drinking.
