Freeze!You aren't from Wutai, are you?
Only those from Wutai are allowed in the tower!I'll have to ask for you to leave!
Hey! I hate people who lie about their identities! Leave this tower at once!
Freeze!Miss Yuffie! You cannot go on to the second floor until you defeat me!
Oh, Miss Yuffie! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?
Then I, Sacred , will be your opponent on the first floor!
Then, begin!Power Change!
It's just my opinion, but you need more training!  is disappointed!
Here I am, Miss Yuffie!
Winning Miss Yuffie's heart must mean you have tremendous skill.
Splendid! Your level and skills have improved...

Silence, Miss Yuffie!
What are you saying, Lord Godo!
Miss Yuffie. We pray for your success!
