Here is where I was... I mean, ...this is my hometown.My tribe were protectors of those who appreciate this beautiful canyon and the Planet.My brave mother fought and died here, but my cowardly father left her...... I am the last of my race.
Yes. My father was a wastrel.And so the mission I inherited from my ancestors, is to protect this place. My journey ends here.
Coming, Grandpa!
Cloud, this is my grandfather, Bugen.He is incredible. He knows everything.
Please stop, grandfather. I'm 48.
......grandfather. I want to be an adult.I want to grow up to be able to protect you and the village.
They have come here on a journey to save the planet.Why don't you show them your apparatus?
He brought friends too. I'll go get them.
(in his room)Don't worry about me. I've seen it many times.It's my first time back in a while. Let me rest for a bit...
......
...Long ago....When I was still very small. We were all around this flame...No, never mind...
It's about my parents.When I talk about my mother, I am full of pride and joy...And that's fine. ...But when I remember my father, my heart is full of anger...
Of course. He...... left mother for dead.When the Gi tribe attacked, he ran off by himself, leaving mother and the people of the Canyon!
...?
Hey? Aren't you going with us, Grandpa?
A certain battle...?
......
Grandpa...... That warrior...
Grandpa, is he...!?
......Oh yeah?
This is...
...That... That's...... Seto...?
Even now...
That...... that is Seto? ...!? Did mother know?
.........
Grandpa!?
Grandpa...
Grandpa... don't talk like that. I don't want to think of life... without you......
Grandpa! You must live!I'll see to it.I'll see to what's happening to the planet. And I'll come back to tell you.
I am  of Cosmo Canyon! The son of the warrior, Seto!I'll come back a warrior true to that noble name! So please, Grandpa...
Seto....... Fa... Father...
Wait for me! I'm coming too!
I think I grew up a little. That's what happened!
I wonder what's going on...
This is Nibelheim? I heard it burnt down.
Cloud... Did you lie to us?
...You don't look good.
What... you're serious?
So you slept as punishment? Isn't that strange? That thinking...
What?
Will it fly? Is it all right to just take it?
, otherwise known as Red XIII.
Who does he think he is......?
I think it's a bit too harsh.
It's going to take off.
I don't really care.
What happened all of a sudden!? Don't scare me like that!
Hmm...... Smells fishy.You're not going to trick us again...?
It's Shinra!!
So you were, Yuffie...!!
What do you mean 'this one' 'THIS one'!So you were concocting some evil scheme!!
What's going on?I thought something was funny, my materia, disappeared!!
O... OH NO! All of our materia... gone!?
Hey... where's Yuffie...?
ZOUNDS!!Grrrrrrrrrgh...... Grrrgh! Grrrrrrgh!!Her objective was stealing our materia from the beginning....sniff... North! She ran off to the North!I'm not going to let her get away with this! Hurry, hurry! We have to get our materia back!
I know she hasn't left town! You still want to leave?
Were we a little too harsh on her?
Wh, what are you doing!?
Help us first!
Hurry and let the two go!
Grrrrrgh...!
I'll just say you... helped.
As long as she doesn't get in our way...!
I guess it'll be fun to show off what I've got.
...you know, of course... My tattoo is number 13.
...Hojo put it on me. Everything else is just war scars, but the number was done by Hojo.
Cloud...I'm number 13. Am I going to go mad too?
But...
But, I...
I'm so excited, my tail's starting to tingle. Let's go, Cloud!
He's number 9. There's a tattoo.
...sniff... sniff... This place smells good.It smells the same as Cosmo Canyon.
I... I saw it.
Don't forget about us!
I'm tingling with excitement.
Cloud! What's wrong!
Something's going to fall down?
That'll be safer. If no one can else take it......Then Sephiroth can't either, right?
I'll be sittin' out here.
Cloud!!
Aeris, are you all right!?
Wait!That road leads to the Northern Mountains. We have to go the other way to find Aeris.
Look, there's a bed here.
Hey, let's rest a bit. I'm tired...
What's wrong? Are you sick?
What! Sephiroth's here too!?
How did you find out?
Wh, ...what should we do? We must hurry to her!
What are you doing!
...Hmm?
...All right, Cloud.
Sephiroth... Which way did he go?
You all right?
Got snow in my ear...
I wonder what's at the top of that cliff? Well we shall see...
The energy of the planet is concentrated here.It is slowly healing its old wound.
I'm going to call everyone.
I feel something... danger?
What's happening, Cloud? That wasn't Sephiroth!
You want me to take the Black Materia? ......all right, I understand.
Cloud, be careful!
I'll protect the Black Materia no matter what!
But, why!? A dream? An illusion?
Cloud's not here... I wonder who...... this is...?
Is this illusion going to continue forever? How do we get out of it?
This is terrible... Did Sephiroth do this?
You all right!!We were in an illusion...
I wonder how Cloud and the others are...It's hard to believe... such a small piece of materia is able to destroy the Planet...
What the!?Is everyone all right?What's going on?Where am I!? Don't leave me alone!
Tifa!!Something is strange... Why was it dark all of a sudden and where is everybody?
R, right!I'm not sure I understand... but I'll go if you want me to.
I'm here! I'm here to help you, Cloud!
It's safe. I'm holding on to it.
Are you all right, Cloud?
Then... here you go. I was a little apprehensive holding this thing.
Cloud, NO! Stop! Please!
Cid......
Do you think we aren't strong enough without Cloud?Do you think we can't save the Planet alone?
And Tifa...... the reason why we all thought it was Cloud was because......
Cheer up, Tifa......
......MaybeCloud is still stuck deep in the North Crater, where the ground cracked and swallowed him up......Buried in the depths of the underground......
The Lifestream sometimes gushes out to the surface from cracks in the ocean floor.I heard that such a place exists.Maybe, just maybe Cloud's......
There appears to be a small island near the Lifestream......They said the Lifestream sometimes suddenly gushes out at the south island.I remember hearing about this from Seto when I was a child, but I don't remember much else......I'm sorry...... Tifa.
Over here!
Halt!
How horrible......
Tell me doctor, is Cloud all right? I mean will he heal?
No wonder. He fell into the Lifestream and was washed up here......
Hmm, I know he'll recover! Cloud was a strong member of SOLDIER.
Are you all right, Tifa?
Yes, that's best!
That's all right. We'll be by again.
Do your best, Tifa. Take care of Cloud.
We should be getting back to the Highwind.
And the Huge Materia......You mean the Huge Materia, don't you? I've heard about it.When, our small materia nears the larger one, something should happen.I'm certain of it.That's why we're using the power of materia in our fight......
Cid.Let's visit Cloud and Tifa from time to time.
Ohh!
Did the Shinra beat us!?
It sure helped having Cid here. I had no idea he could drive a train...
Wa...What!?
What are we going to do now?
We got it going, but what about the brakes?
We're gaining speed!
WHOOOOOO----A!!
I could never forgive Shinra!
We HAVE to stop them!!
You must be talking about Cloud...
We'll do our best for Cloud and you.......And Aeris, too.
Shinra again.
Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand, too.
We can't afford to be beaten!
We must get there before them and stop them!
You mean, Cloud...?
Where are we?
......not enough strength.
Things don't seem too favorable.
We must get there first and stop them.
Yes, it's you Cloud......
Say Cid.I wonder how Tifa and Cloud...... are doing.
I wonder how Cloud's doing.I wonder if Tifa needs a break......I could look after him instead.
Just a little more and I would have beaten him.
It looks like the Lifestream has settled as well.
But what about Tifa and Cloud!?
Don't say anything, Cloud. All you've been doing is apologizing.
What? I don't understand!
I'm glad you're back with us!
If we take a short cut, we might just make it......!
Help?
But it's already in the water!
Aren't we going after the Huge Materia?
My legs can't budge it.
It moved!Cloud!! Try it!
Cloud!! Try it!
We're Submarine No. 2
Take o-ff!
I can't swim...
Ugh. It's salty! Let's go to the airport!
I would like to ride it! Let's get one from the submarine dock beneath Junon!
Where's their destination?
Shinra only cares if things are good right now.But, I plan to live for 500 years and won't stand for that type of thinking.
What should we do? Are we all going to die?
But, what are we going to do with the Huge Materia? Are we just going to give it up?
I can't do anything with my strength alone......!
Makes you worry, doesn't it?
Huh!?Did you...... hear something?
Let's go see Grandfather! To Cosmo Canyon!I'm sure he'll be able to tell us something that will be helpful!
Hurry, hurry! We must go meet Grandfather!
My head feels like it's getting crushed.
nghh... no good. We alone cannot do it. We need to have the others here.
......as was I.
Is it impossible for us to carry on... what Aeris tried to accomplish?
I see... She returned there once again, correct?
You're going too?
It must be the planet. The planet is calling you!
Aeris used to pat me on the nose sometimes.I used to hate being treated like a child like that, but I also liked the attention.I wanted to apologize to her for what I did when we first met.
Sorry... I'm really sorry. But now, I have......
If I were more of an adult... Perhaps, I would have a better idea of what to do?Phew... I wish I could grow up.I wonder if I'll be an adult after all this is over?
WE'LL take care of it.
What Aeris left for us... We can't let it go to waste.
Midgar...I hated the fact I was caught by Hojo and taken back to the lab where they did all kinds of experiments on me...But because of that I was able to meet you all...People you meet... others you don't...... strange isn't it?
Something's wrong...
Let's watch from the Airship!
Midgar!
It went right through Weapon......
Will we save the world if we beat Sephiroth?I'm frightened, but I'll do my best. Let's hurry to the Northern Cave!
I wonder why Hojo performed so many of these experiments?Why couldn't he content himself with quiet research?
I have an old score to settle with Hojo, so let's hurry and go!
I smell it! The cannon's not this way!
!?
The father...
Seven more days. That's what Grandfather said.
.........yes.
But, you know, Cid.
No, Yuffie's missing.
......Although she's not here, she left us a window of opportunity...
Grandfather!!
Grandfather!!
I can't leave you like this, grandfather...!It's the duty of my... Seto's son, to guard this canyon and her people...
.........
Grandfather......
......Grandpa told me that he's going away again!
It seems like he really liked that Airship.He told me he couldn't stay still and just zipped out of here!He even gave me a gift, look!
Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to give gifts AFTER you come back?Ha ha...... Grandpa sure is strange! Haa... ha ha...... ha......
Yeah... maybe...Thanks, Cloud......
.........Don't worry. Grandpa will come back floating, saying 'Ho Ho Hoooo' again...
I am , son of Seto... I am afraid of nothing...It's all right, all right. I'm , the son of brave Seto... I'm not afraid of Sephiroth...
All right, then I'll go...
All life on this planet, indeed the very life of this planet is in our hands...
Which way are we headed, Cloud?
All right, then I'm going...
We're not the only ones fighting.The planet's fighting too!
Don't leave us, Cloud.
Cloud, I found this...
By the way Yuffie, didn't you find something on the way?
We finally made it here.
Look at the number...
They're coming! They're already on the floor next to us!
Wha... what!?
My front legs...... my hind legs...... my tail's about to tear off!!
...No way we're gonna lose!!I'm going to see it through to the end. For our future... And that of the planet...I understand now, Grandpa. This is my mission!I won't let the Lifestream... or the Life of the Planet wither away!!
Holy should be moving soon,and that means this place will...
It's too late for Holy.Meteor is approaching the Planet.Holy is having the opposite effect.Forget Midgar,we've gotta worry about the Planet.
