Lord Godo is in this house.He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep......What, Yuffie... It's best to ask Lord Godo about that.But today he's not in the best of... Well, I should say... But really he's not so......
In the Weapons shop...
Weapons ShopkeeperSorry, listen I... No, nothing... never mind.
ManSorry, but we're entirely sold out now.What's this here? Ah, no... that's uh......a sample! Yeah, that's it... a sample. Sorry, but why don't you all come back later?
The local pub, Turtle's Paradise... Outside is a flyer.

BarkeeperHey, hey, welcome! You on a trip? Well, just relax and make yourself at home.Nowadays, thanks to tourism, Wutai's able to get by.
ManHey. Did you hear? There used to be a Water God here in Wutai.They say the Water God was a huge snake!Now we live in a world filled with Mako. Not many people would believe in something like that now.But some in the world, and here in Wutai, still believe.Believe in the scales of the Water God and in materia that has its power in it.
Cloud walks up to the Turks - Reno, Rude, and Elena - who are drinking at a table.
ElenaYy, you!? How did you get here...?
She jumps up.
Never mind that. I guess it's fate that brought us together.Get ready to die!!
Cloud and the others ready their weapons. Reno and Rude don't move.
Reno...Elena, you talk too much.
ElenaWw, what?
RenoWhat are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?
ElenaWe're taking our vacation and resting up from our work.
RenoNow our vacation is ruined.
ElenaB, but...
Rude...even the booze tastes bad now.
Elena...sorry...
She sits back down, and Cloud relaxes.
ElenaHmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight!The next time we meet I won't be so nice.
RenoDrink, Rude! How long have we been a team...?There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm glad I did it.I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you.
RudeTo the Turks... To Reno... cheers!
Outside the Item Shop, a little kid is running around.
Little KidAlright, alright, alright! I know!On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!A girl with materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing Da-chao for some time now.You know I've noticed that there's  pounding noise from time to time in this store.
Lord Godo is in this house.He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep......Anyhow, for some reason Yuffie's had a fondness for materia ever since I can remember.She's always hung around places she thought might have it.
In the Item Shop...
Item ShopkeeperWe got a lot of different stuff here. Take what you want.
WomanI'm sorry. The sign outside says "Materia", but there's almost no materia left anywhere in Wutai.Listen, this is just a backwoods town. We don't have much to do with Shinra, and besides...If we had a lot of materia, Wutai would be a much more exciting town, but we don't...
Cloud opens the nearby treasure chest.
Received "MP Absorb" Materia!
Yuffie jumps down from above.
Stole "MP Absorb" Materia!
WomanHuh? What? You DID?
Cloud continues up the path towards Godo's house.
Man outside Godo's HouseThat five-storied pagoda over there is called the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods...The Five Gods are Power, Speed, Magic, War and Omni, who has the best characteristics of everything.Since ancient times, we in Wutai, have worshipped Da-chao and the Water God.Legend has it that the village has been protected by Da-chao, the Water God, and the Five Mighty Gods.But in the last battle, we didn't fare so well... I guess our beliefs were based on nothing more than legends.
Inside the pagoda...
Gorky...
If Cloud tries to run upstairs...
GorkyFreeze!You aren't from Wutai, are you?
Cloud- No- Yes

No
GorkyOnly those from Wutai are allowed in the tower!I'll have to ask for you to leave!


Yes
GorkyHey! I hate people who lie about their identities! Leave this tower at once!

Inside Godo's house, they find Godo lying on a futon.
GodoGOOGAH... what do you want?Don't have... GAH... anything much but, you should be able to... GOO... rest yourselves here. GOGAH... make yourselves at home.......Yuffie? ......nope, never heard of her. ...GOOGO......you again? I told you once, and I'm telling you again, I don't know her.
He sits up.
Listen, I said I didn't know her! There isn't anyone named Yuffie here in Wutai!
He gets to his feet and turns to face Cloud.
...never seen you around here before...Lately I've been seeing a lot of Shinra soldiers around here... You wouldn't have anything to do with that would you?I don't care about who you are.But if you're in trouble with the Shinra, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.I don't want the Shinra hanging around here looking over my shoulder.
YuffieWhat's with you, you coward!
She jumps down from the ceiling to stand in his doorway.
GodoYuffie......!
YuffieYou scared of the Shinra?Then why don't you fall into line and obey them, just like all of the other towns!
She runs into the room.
Those guys are the ones who are really fighting the Shinra!
GodoShut up! What would you know about this?
YuffieYou get beaten once, and then that's it?What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?
GodoNo kid like you's going to talk to me like that!You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
YuffieThat's my style! And it's my own business, not yours! Don't you try and dictate what I should do!
GodoStyle...? Dictate...?Throwin' around all those fancy words... You're a miserable daughter!
YuffieHmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!!
She runs out and into the shrine down the hall. Godo starts to chase after her, but gives up and returns to his room.
Godo......take your things and get out of here now.To protect Wutai, we cannot afford to stand up to Shinra.
She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.Like father like daughter...Yuffie's like that, you know. Sometimes she'll just bust into people's houses.Then she hides in the shadows... Just like a little kid.
Woman Walking near RiverLife is just like the flowing of a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it.Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see.Yuffie? I saw her a while ago. She must be in one of the houses around here.
At the old man's house...
BoyOh no! More weirdosNo, these aren't like the one from a while ago, but these ones look weird too!
Old ManWell, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see... what was your name?
BoyNo, Gramps! This isn't anyone you know! This is just some stranger who barged into our house!What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl came in here a minute ago and I...
Cloud pushes aside a screen to reveal Yuffie hiding behind it.
Yuffie......
She dashes out of the house.
Old ManOh, how exciting. You a friend of my grandson's?
BoyNo, Gramps! These guy's are creepy! They're runnin' all over the place!
She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.Like father like daughter...That reminds me, Lately I've been seeing a kid around here that reminds me of Yuffie.Always sneakin' around corners And into somethin' she shouldn't be.
If Cloud tries to leave Wutai...

BarretWait, that damn Yuffie's still gotta be somewhere in this cheap town! Or you all jes' gonna go on?
AerisI don't think she came out from here... Is that ok?
TifaKnowing Yuffie, she's still hidden somewhere in town. You sure?
NanakiI know she hasn't left town! You still want to leave?
VincentShe couldn't have left town... I think she is must still be here... Or do you want to go on?
CidYou lettin' that damn kid off the hook? I know she's gotta be in this town somewhere!

Outside the Turtle's Paradise, there is a barrel that's wiggling. Cloud and the others position themselves near the escape routes and then open it. Yuffie jumps out and tries to get away, but finds herself surrounded.

CloudYou can't get away, Yuffie.
TifaGive it up, Yuffie!
CidYou lost, Yuffie.

YuffieO... ok, I know... I was wrong......You win. I'll give you back your materia...
She leads them to her house, just as two Shinra soldiers run into Turtle's Paradise.

Shinra SoldierSo our reports were right! He IS here on vacation!We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up!
Reno...what a drag.
Shinra SoldierWh, what was that...?
RenoRight now we're off duty and can't run off to save your butts.
Shinra SoldierWe know you're off duty, but...
RenoIf you knew that, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' me sober.
Shinra SoldierBut you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too!
There is a pause. Reno says nothing.
Shinra SoldierAll right, that's it! We'll get him without any help from the Turks, just you see!
The two soldiers run out. One comes back momentarily.
Shinra SoldierAnd don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about this!!
He leaves again.
ElenaReno, do you think that was really such a good idea!?I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk would act!?
RenoElena. Don't misunderstand.A pro isn't someone who sacrifices himself for his job. That's just a fool.
ElenaRude...?
Rude.........
ElenaWell, I don't buy that! Goodbye!!
She runs out.
Rude.........
RenoRelax. She's not a child. Let her have her way now...

At Yuffie's house...
YuffieI know, the materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. ...Follow me.
She leads them down to the basement, a training room.
Flyer on Wall[Turtle's Paradise] No. 6Drink at the "Turtle's Paradise" And talk about Wutai!You'll know "Turtle's Paradise" by the big pot outside!!
Yuffie...I've been hearing that ever since I was little.Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more important...You saw what it looks like now, right? ...JUST a resort town...After we lost the war, we got peace, but with that, we lost something else. Now look at Wutai...That's why... if I had lots of materia I could...
She starts crying.

CloudListen, Yuffie. I don't care about the history of Wutai or your feelings.You've got our materia and I want it back... now.If you give it back now, we'll drop the whole thing.
TifaI'm sorry, Yuffie. I know how you feel, but we need materia too....We just can't let you have it. Please understand.
Cid......Dammit, Yuffie. We ain't got time to be listening to your life story.If you want materia, get it yourself. That's how you should do it.

YuffieI know. I know that...That... sniff... switch... the lever on the left...... materia's... sniff, hic... in there.
BarretAin't nuthin' we can do about it...
AerisI feel bad, but......
TifaNow, the Materia...
NanakiWere we a little too harsh on her?
Cait SithWell, let's get our materia back.
VincentThere was nothing else to do.
CidHmmph... I dunno......
Cloud- Flip the Left Lever- Flip the Right Lever
Regardless of which lever he pulls, a cage comes down atop the party members.

BarretWh...what the hell is this!?
AerisEyaaaaah
TifaEyaaaaah
NanakiWh, what are you doing!?
Cait SithWh, what is this!?
Vincent!?
CidWhoa!?

YuffieHa ha ha------! Never trust anyone that easily!! / Ha ha------! You should've listened!!The Materia's mine! Tough!You want your materia? Then go find it yourself!Yeah that's right. And when you're looking for the materia, remember you gotta steel it.Heh heh... steel... steel! Get it?C ya!!
She runs off. If Cloud tries to run after her without helping the others...

BarretY, yo, wait up!!
AerisWait, don't leave us!
TifaW...wait don't leave us here!
NanakiHelp us first!
Cait SithHey help us...please!
VincentWait, don't go by yourself!
CidHey! Help me first!

Cloud frees the others from the cage and they go looking for her.At the Turtle's Paradise...
BarkeeperSeems like the town got really boisterous since you arrived. Did anything happen?
If you have now obtained all 6 Turtles Paradise flyers...
BarkeeperCongrats! You have just found all six flyers for the "Turtles Paradise"!How wonderful! Now here is your prize, just as we promised!!
Received "Power Source"!eceived "Guard Source"!Received "Magic Source"!Received "Mind Source"!Received "Speed Source"!Received "Luck Source"!Received "Megalixir"!
BarkeeperPlease come again to "Turtles Paradise"! We're looking forward to seeing you!
Reno......It's just that we're off duty!I don't feel like drinking with you. And don't talk to me.
Rude.........
Cloud goes to the bell near Godo's house to find the gate open. When he rings the bell, a hidden door opens. Going inside, he finds Yuffie being abducted by a man in black.
YuffieLet go! I SAID let GO!Hey! Who do you think I...... OW! What're you doin'...? Jerk!

CloudYou......!
TifaOh! You're......!
CidWw, who are you!?

Corneo......ho..... ...............ho.........Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!

CloudCorneo!?
TifaDon Corneo!?
CidThe hell are you doing!

CorneoHohi!I've finally got a new chicky!Two for one, in fact! Hohi, hohi!
Cloud, Tifa, or CidTwo!?
ElenaH......hey! Let go of me! You're gonna regret this!!
CorneoHohi, hohi! Hohihi!
Corneo and his lackeys run off. If Cloud leaves and enters Godo's house from the front, he finds two Shinra soldiers blocking the way into the shrine.
Shinra SoldierNow listen up! They must be in the area! Find them no matter what!
Shinra SoldierYes, sir!!
On following Corneo up from the hidden room into the shrine, three Shinra soldiers cut Corneo off.
Shinra SoldierThere he is! It's Corneo! Don't let him get away!Attaaaack!
Corneo runs to the side, and the soldiers attack Cloud and the others instead. Back outside Godo's house, they find Reno and Rude.
RenoHmm... that Corneo is good at escaping...
Rude......Elena.
RenoLet's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can do.
Rude nods and runs off.
Reno......Sounded pretty good.
He turns to Cloud.
If Elena is in his hands, that's going to make things a little difficult.And uh...

Cloud......Ok. Corneo took Yuffie from us.And without Yuffie, there's no way we'll get our materia back.
Tifa......all right. Corneo stole Yuffie from us, as well.And without her, there's no way we'll get our materia back.
Cid......that's just beautiful! And now that *#$^@'s walked off with Yuffie, too!And without that brat, we can't get our hands on our materia!

RenoDon't misunderstand.We have no intention of joining you. But for now, we'll agree not to bother each other. That's all.

CloudThat's fine. We have absolutely no intention of cooperating with the Turks either.Now, uh, just what direction did Corneo run off to?
TifaThe same goes for us. We don't want to be friendly with the Turks.Now which direction did Corneo run off in?
CidOf course! There ain't no way we'd wanna join up with the Turks anyway!Anyhow, which direction did that %^$*& run off in?

RenoHmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the place that stands out the most.
Reno runs off.
Two girls just went off towards Da-chao. I wonder if that place is starting to become popular with the kids?One had herself all tangled up in a rope. And the other one kind of looked like Yuffie.
Little KidAlright, alright, alright! I saw an old man in flashy clothes running towards Da-chao!He was babblin' somethin' and looked like he could float! It almost bowled me over!
Cloud arrives at Da-chao.
RenoYou're finally here. We're gonna split into two.You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena.Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, Yuffie.For now...
Following Reno up the mountain...
RenoDon't fool around. You know the enemy's not gonna wait for us, right?
Following Rude, they find him outside the fire caves...
Rude......
If Cloud tries to proceed through the fire caves...

CloudWhoa!!Can't go through here... That flame would make crispy critters of us in an instant.
TifaEyaaaah!There is no way past this!
CidDamn, that's hot!I like hot baths, but this is TOO hot!

In the end they find Corneo holding Yuffie and Elena tied to the face of a statue, observing them from the palm of the statue's hand.
YuffieLET... ME...... GO!!!!
CorneoHmm! Delicious... scrumptious! I think I've just found a new HOBBY!Which shall it be? Hmm... Hmm...Should I go... with HER?
ElenaHe... hey, I'm one of the 'Turks'! Don't think you can get away with this!?
CorneoOr... maybe... HER?
YuffieOh GAWD! If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've taken rope escape lessons more seriously!!
CorneoHmm!!! I've made my choice! My companion for the night will be.........the cheerful one!
YuffieGROSS-NESS!Don't mess with me old man! You don't even have any Materia!
CorneoOooooh! And she's saucy, too! Wheee! Wheee!

CloudAll right, that's it!!
TifaHold it right there!
CidHey, hey, hey! That's as far as you go!

CorneoHee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?
Cloud and the others run in.
YuffieOh man! Cloud......!
Or, if Tifa:
Oh man! Tifa......!
Or, if Cid:
Oh man! That old fart, Cid......!
CorneoWheeel... long time no see.
CloudDon't tell me you forgot...

BarretYou damn Midgar hyena...!
AerisYou just don't get it, do you...!?
TifaThat fall into the trap really hurt!
NanakiHurry and let the two go!
Cait SithListen you stupid, slimy, sleazy old scab bag! If you want to get women, there's such a thing as the RIGHT way!
VincentI don't care what you're doing, so much as the idiotic way you're doing it...
CidMaybe God'd forgive an ugly ^#@# like you, but I won't!

CorneoBe quiet! None of you know how much I've suffered since then...It's a long story, but......

CloudI don't really care! Let Yuffie and Elena go!
TifaWe don't want to hear it! Just let the two go!
CidI don't really give a damn! You're gonna let the two girls go, or else I'm gonna break your arm!

CorneoHmm... You guys are... serious. ......Good, good....this ain't no time for me to be fooling around either...Why did you kill my little Aps?I'm gonna make you PLAY with my new pet, so you won't get in the way of my search for a bride!RAPPS---come here!!
Cloud and the others fight and defeat Rapps.
CorneoWait...Just wait a second!

CloudSHUT UP!
TifaYou better say your prayers!
CidDon't be such a poor loser, old man!

CorneoJust listen to me - it won't take long.Why do you think a bad guy like me would swallow his pride and plead for his life?
Cloud, Tifa, or Cid- 1 Because he's ready to die- 2 Because he's sure to win- 3 Because he's clueless

1 Because he's ready to die
CorneoHmm...! WRONG...!


2 Because he's sure to win
CorneoHmm...! RIGHT!


3 Because he's clueless
CorneoHmm...! Close, but no cigar...!

Corneo pushes a button and Elena and Yuffie flip upside down.
ElenaEyaaaah...!
YuffieMakes me so MAD...!
CorneoIf I push this button, they'll fall upside down, and we'll have a SQUASHED TOMATOES!
CloudDamn...!

BarretDamn dirty-playin' $#%@&T$*^%$!
AerisAll right...
TifaCoward!
NanakiGrrrrrgh...!
Cait SithYou sure are vulgar!
Vincent......!
CidSo this is how a loser lives...!

CorneoNow, give me your women too!Ha, ha, ha, ha! I guess I'm the one laughing last!
RenoNo, that would be us.
CorneoHee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?
Enter Reno.
Corneo...The Turks!
RenoYou knew this was gonna happen ever since you leaked that secret.We're going to take care of you... personally.
CorneoDAMMIT! Then they're all goin' with me!
Rude runs in from behind and throws something at Corneo, who falls to the edge of the hand.
CorneoUgh...!
RenoGood timing, Rude.
Rude...Let's get to work.
Reno walks over to Corneo and steps on his fingers.
RenoAll right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up.Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with those guys to get you...?1. Because we were ready to die2. Because we were sure of victory3. Because we were clueless
CorneoTwo... Number two?
RenoAll wrong.
He grinds his foot into Corneo's hand.
CorneoNo...! Wait, sto......!
He loses his grip and falls.
Aaaaaaaaaa......p
RenoThe correct answer was...
Rude...because it's our job.
ElenaOh, thank you very much...!I never expected you'd to come help......
RenoElena, don't act so weak.You're a Turks!
ElenaY... Yes, sir!

BarretNever thought you'd come an' help us...
AerisThanks for your help.
TifaTh... Thanks.
NanakiI'll just say you... helped.
Cait SithYou guys have some good in you.
VincentIt would appear thanks are in order...
CidI guess, thanks for today.

Rude......
Reno's cell phone rings, and he answers it.
RenoYes... this is Reno.Yes... Yes... I'll get on it right away.
ElenaWas that the company?
RenoYeah, they want us to find Cloud...
Cloud and the others ready their weapons.
RudeAre we on...?
RenoNo, today we're off duty.
YuffieHey---who cares about that!? Get----me-----down----!
Back at Yuffie's house. She darts around putting the materia back in its slots.
YuffiePhew, perfect. Now the materia is back in its rightful place.

CloudHey... the placement of it is all messed up.
TifaHey, what is this...? The placement of it's all messed up!
CidWhat the hell's goin' on!? The placement of the materia's all messed up!

YuffieHuh? Oh, it'll be all right...Don't be so picky!Anyways, that sure was close......No, normally I would kick their butts, Boom, Bang!!
She shakes her fist and turns away.
That Corneo guy's a real pain.
Behind her back, Cloud and the others exchange looks.
YuffieI'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy.
Cloud and the others walk out.
YuffieOh, by the way, some of those guys from the Turks are good, huh?At least, after all that, we got the materia back.Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey...
She turns around to notice they've gone.
......Hey!! W...... Wait!Oh, all right. Here, I'll give this to you guys.
She runs into her room to grab something and comes back out.
Here, look, look!
Received "MP Absorb" Materia!
Yuffie.........Come on, wait---!
She runs out after them.
No matter what anyone says, I'm going with you!...next time......

After everything has died down, they can go back to Wutai so Yuffie can climb the pagoda.
Woman Walking near RiverMateria is like Life. They both come from the large ocean of life, and both must return to it.
In the Weapons Shop...
ManListen, I'm sorry about last time. Yuffie told me not to sell anything to you.
Weapons ShopkeeperHey yo! Welcome!Strike while the iron's hot, I say! We got some of the best blades right out of the furnace!
Little KidAlright, alright, alright! I know!On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!Why Da-chao? Alright, alright, alright! I don't know!
Cloud and the others enter the pagoda.
If Yuffie is in the party and they try to proceed to the second floor without fighting...
GorkyFreeze!Miss Yuffie! You cannot go on to the second floor until you defeat me!
GorkyOh, Miss Yuffie! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?
Yuffie- Yeah, that's it- No way!
GorkyThen I, Sacred Gorky, will be your opponent on the first floor!
A boy runs down from upstairs.
ShakeYo! They call me Shake! I'll be watchin' your fight with Gorky!
GorkyThen, begin!Power Change!
Yuffie fights Gorky.

If she loses...
GorkyIt's just my opinion, but you need more training! Gorky is disappointed!
ShakeNo good! You have to do Gorky! Are you mocking this Pagoda?
YuffieShut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


If she wins...
GorkyHere I am, Miss Yuffie!
YuffieOf course!
ShakeHmm, I thought you were just a wild girl, but you handled that pretty well!Well, we'll see how you do on next one...

Shake goes upstairs. If Cloud returns to talk to Gorky without Yuffie in the party...
GorkyWinning Miss Yuffie's heart must mean you have tremendous skill.
On the second floor, without Yuffie...
ShakeYou aren't good enough to be here! This is the Wutai Temple of Martial Arts!
Once Yuffie proceeds to the second floor, she can try to go to the next floor prematurely...
ShakeHey, you there! Don't ignore me!
YuffieWho's next?
ShakeAre you blind? I'm right here!
YuffieWhat? I gotta fight a punk?
ShakeHeh! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl!
YuffieWh, what did you say!?
ShakeSee what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so immature!Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me!
YuffieNow watch...!
Shake'bout the only thing you do really good is breathe! Sure you're brave enough to fight!
Yuffie- Stop yappin'!- I'll forgive you

Stop yappin'!
ChekhovHm, so someone finally got past Gorky.


I'll forgive you
ShakeSo when it comes down to it, you're just all talk. Brat!

Once Yuffie decides to fight, a woman comes down from upstairs.
ChekhovSo, I guess it's time for Chekhov to stand in...
ShakeHere I go, brat! Speed Change!
Yuffie fights Shake.

If she loses...
ShakeHYAAAAAAH! BRATBRATBRATBRAT!!
ChekhovYou can't go to the next floor unless you beat Shake.
YuffieShut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


If she wins...
ShakeURRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit!
YuffieOf course!
ChekhovHo, ho, ho... It's been a while since I felt pain...

Chekhov goes upstairs. If Cloud returns to talk to Shake without Yuffie in the party...
ShakeCompared to me, all of you are nothin' but a buncha babies.
On the third floor, without Yuffie...
ChekhovThat being the case, we have nothing further to discuss.
Once Yuffie proceeds to the third floor, she can try to go to the next floor prematurely...
ChekhovHow dare they mock us like that, thinking they could sneak past us.
A man comes down from the fourth floor.
StanivSo even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had to fight, Chekhov.
ChekhovUnfortunately, this is as far as it goes. Staniv, you watch over there.
YuffieThat ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength of youth!
ChekhovKeep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to get burned.
Yuffie- I got insurance- Let's get this over with, old bag

I got insurance
ChekhovHo, ho, ho. We'll see if you still talk like that after you taste some of my Sacred Magic...Magic Change!


Let's get this over with, old bag
ChekhovHo, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of diapers!?
StanivFirst, Chekhov will keep you company...

Yuffie fights Chekhov.

If she loses...
ChekhovHo, ho, ho! What does a immature young child know...?
StanivSo this IS the average person's limit...
YuffieShut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


If she wins...
ChekhovI can't believe you beat me...
YuffieOf course!
StanivThis should be interesting...! It's been a long time since I've had a chance to use my powers to their fullest...

Staniv goes upstairs. If Cloud returns to talk to Chekhov without Yuffie in the party...
ChekhovManaging that girl must be exceedingly rough on you.
On the fourth floor, without Yuffie...
StanivIf it were not for Miss Yuffie, I wouldn't be facing him...
Once Yuffie proceeds to the fourth floor, she can try to go to the next floor prematurely...
StanivHAAAAH!
The door closes.
StanivThe rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your opponent... Although it's a five-storied pagoda, the fourth floor is the highest...In other words, no one has ever defeated me--Master of Weaponry!You still want to try...?
Yuffie- Just come on!!- I'll pass!

Just come on!!
StanivI like you! Now watch...Weapon Change!


I'll pass!
StanivYou don't seem like the kind of person who can make it to the fourth floor without a problem...

Yuffie fights Staniv.

If she loses...
StanivHow unfortunate! It was over before I could even put all of my strength into it...
YuffieShut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!


If she wins...
StanivWh, what...!?
YuffieOf course!

The others start coming up from the lower floors.
GorkySplendid! Your level and skills have improved...
ShakeOh, ho! You might not be as much of a child as we thought you were!
ChekhovOf course. If WE lost to her...
StanivYou have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to face HIM......!
He goes upstairs, and the others follow. If Cloud proceeds to the fifth floor without Yuffie...
Godo...Hm. You can do it......
Once Yuffie proceeds to the fifth floor, she finds the four of them standing on either side of the room with Godo at the head.
Gorky......
ShakeSh......!
Chekhov...
Staniv......
YuffieD, ...Dad!?
GodoI'm glad you made it this far, Yuffie!
YuffieWhy, why are you......
GodoI'll answer you by having you try your skills against me!Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you don't... then I'll have to kill you!
YuffieH... hey!
GodoWhat are you doing! OMNI-Change! ......!!
Yuffie fights Godo.If she loses...
YuffieDammit......
GodoOhhh! And what was that!? Come back when you get more training!
When Yuffie tries again...
YuffieI'll show you this time, you old Fart-meister!
GodoHmm? A slight improvement.Come at me with all you have! OMNI-Change! ......!!
After winning the battle, both lie sprawled on the floor panting.
Yuffie...heave...... heave...
Godo...huff...... puff......
YuffieO... old coot... n...... ot... bad...
GodoYou've...... also...... improved...
YuffieHah... Ha, ha......
Godo...Heh, heh......
YuffieHa ha haaaaaa......!
GodoWaha haaaaa......!
They eventually get up off the floor and compose themselves.
GodoIt's time I gave this to you, Yuffie...This is Leviathan Materia. Take it.
Received "Leviathan" Materia!
StanivBut, Lord Godo. The Leviathan Materia should only be given to the person who conquers and takes over this Pagoda. That is our custom...
YuffieCUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM... I'm so sick of hearing that!It's so stupid!
GorkySilence, Miss Yuffie!
YuffieThen what 'bout the rest of you? You have all that power...Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?
GodoYuffie...!
YuffieYou too, dad...! Just because you lost the war!And turning Wutai into a place like this!
Chekhov...What do you want to say?
YuffieYou turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to tourists...How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!!
Godo...
ShakeShe IS a kid.
YuffieWh, what did you say...!?
GodoYuffie!!Forgive me... It's all my fault...
GorkyWhat are you saying, Lord Godo!
GodoLosing the war... turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault...
ChekhovLord Godo!
GodoSilence!!Yuffie......I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war.But, after I lost the war, I began to think...Is strength, only for defeating the enemy?...or just something to show-off to others...?Might begets might.That's the same way as the Shinra...
Yuffie......
GodoI knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai.But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai...And now, I realize both are necessary...Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless...!
StanivLord Godo...
GodoYou there, please take Yuffie with you!I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!

BarretJes' don't do nothin' funny to our Materia...!
AerisAll right. We'll take your daughter with us.
Tifa...after that, how can we refuse?
NanakiAs long as she doesn't get in our way...!
Cait SithIf you put it that way, we can't refuse...
VincentHmm... You may come if you want to...
CidWell, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the rest to ol' Cid!

CloudAll right, I don't mind.
GodoGo, Yuffie!For the sake of strengthening Wutai!
YuffieDad...
GodoI'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return!Go! And come back alive!
Yuffie......Of course!
Everyone else files out, and Yuffie starts to follow them.
GodoYuffie, wait a minute.The Materia they all have...After their battle is over, you think they'll still want it?
YuffieDad...!
GodoGo! Survive till the end! And return!With the Materia!
YuffieHeh, heh... you bet!
She runs off.
Afterwards...
GodoGo! Survive to the end! And return to us!Mat-...Take care of the Materia!!
Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:
Your Mat-...I mean, please look after Yuffie...!
StanivMiss Yuffie. Your feelings for Wutai are the same as Lord Godo's. Always remember that...
Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:
Please take care of Miss Yuffie.
ChekhovFight so that you never bring shame on Wutai.
Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:
She's always like this. It'll be rougher on you.
ShakeYou say there's some unusual materia where the underground pipe is!?But, first you gotta get if from a monster and unless you use your head. You won't be able to do it.
Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:
Did that kid mature at all?
GorkyMiss Yuffie. We pray for your success!
Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:
Oh, you there! How is Miss Yuffie doing?
Cloud and the others leave Wutai and return to their quest.

< Rocket Town | Wutai | The World >
Lord Godo is in this house.He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep......Anyhow, for some reason Yuffie's had a fondness for materia ever since I can remember.She's always hung around places she thought might have it.
She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.Like father like daughter...Yuffie's like that, you know. Sometimes she'll just bust into people's houses.Then she hides in the shadows... Just like a little kid.
She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.Like father like daughter...That reminds me, Lately I've been seeing a kid around here that reminds me of Yuffie.Always sneakin' around corners And into somethin' she shouldn't be.
Two girls just went off towards Da-chao. I wonder if that place is starting to become popular with the kids?One had herself all tangled up in a rope. And the other one kind of looked like Yuffie.
The end is right in front of us...But what can you do about it? Just go on living your life day in and day out...
