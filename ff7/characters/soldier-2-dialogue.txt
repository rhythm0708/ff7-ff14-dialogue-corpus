You know, I got some tickets to "Loveless", do you want to go?
You mean, you really are concerned for me?
Right. You mean the AVALANCHERS?Don't you worry. SOLDIER has been added to the police force.Boy, it's been a while since SOLDIER's been mobilized, hasn't it?I ever tell you that I flunked the SOLDIER entrance exam?
............sigh.
Oh, you, of course.
L, look... This is my job, so I have to be here until the absolute last minute.
It's so boring, being on watch.
Practice... oh, you mean practice my pose.Does someone in SOLDIER always have to be careful about what other people think?...How did it go?
I really don't want to be in SOLDIER.
...Late again.
Ok wise-guy, I'll ask about Materia just so you can let off some stress.
Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol.When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan...
Man...... It's so boring keeping watch at the Underwater Reactor.
Mommy... My mommy...
They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor.
