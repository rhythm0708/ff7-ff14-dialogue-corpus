No! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!
...I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But that's what I was ordered to do.
No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!
Waaaaaaaaaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra!Heidegger, the head of Public Safety Maintenance!
...You're serious, aren't you... ...ohboy, ohbooy, ohboy....I'm not fooling around here either, you know.Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout.And they're really going to crush them... literally,By breaking the support holding up the plate above them.
You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PINGand everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums...I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6.
Just a second!
No wait, it'll only take a second.How do you think scum like me feels when they babble on about the truth?
Buuzzzzz! Wrong!
Woo-hoo! Right!
Close, but no cigar!
