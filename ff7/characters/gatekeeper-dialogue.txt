Hey, Nanaki! You're safe!Come on, and say hello to Bugenhagen!
Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Are you familiar with this land?
You lied. That is something that is not treated lightly here in Cosmo Canyon.
Let me explain.People from all over the world gather here to seek the Study of Planet Life.
Ummgah! It's full capacity at present, so I'm afraid I can't let you enter.
...Oh, is that so? You helped our Nanaki? Please, come in.
Nanaki is Nanaki. That's his name.
Since you're here, why don't you listen to Bugenhagen's story?
Did you get to see Bugenhagen's contraption? If you haven't yet, you must!
Leaving already? But it appears your friends still want to learn more about the planet...
Hm? If you're looking for Bugenhagen, he went to the Sealed Door.Remember, there's a steel door on the way to Bugenhagen's room.What's that door there for anyhow? It's been closed forever...
Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Make yourselves at home.
Oh, it's you. This is terrible. The color of that unlucky star...The children are all so scared that they won't even go outside.I'd rather not see it either...

Bugenhagen is what keeps our hearts strong...
