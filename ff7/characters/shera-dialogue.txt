Um... may I help you?
...If you would like to use it, please ask the Captain. The Captain should be in the Rocket.I'm . And what are your names?
Hmm... So you're not with the Shinra.I thought the approval for the reopening of the Space Program came.
President Rufus is scheduled to come here. The Captain's been so restless all morning.
Excuse me... Cloud?Did the Captain say anything?
Oh...?
I... I'm sorry.
No, no. He's always like this.
No... It's because of my stupid mistake.I was the one who destroyed his dream...
I'm... I'm sorry.
But...
I'm sorry......
It's , Captain. Don't mind me, go ahead with the launch.
I was still concerned. The results of the oxygen tank test weren't satisfactory.
I don't mind.If I can just fix this, the launch will be a success. I'm almost done.
Captain!
Tank Number 7 check is complete. Once I complete Tank Number 8, it's all clear.
He pushed the Emergency Engine Shut Down switch, aborting the mission, to save my life.After that, the Space Program was cut back and the launch was canceled.It's my fault his dream was destroyed...That's why... it's all right. I don't care what the Captain says, I'll live my life for him.
I... I'm sorry.
Is President Rufus here to announce that he's going to restart the Space Program?
(from behind Cloud)Uh, excuse me...This way...
You wanted to use the Tiny Bronco, right?
I believe Palmer's going to take it. Why don't you talk to him?
I'll take care of everything at home. But please take care of the Captain.
...What's going to happen?
Don't say that, Cid.
I tagged along. I'm coming to help you.
The Escape Pod is this way. Please hurry.
Hurry. I'm going to detach the Escape Pod.
It'll be OK. I've been checking it till now.
......Thanks.
Now all we have to take care of is Meteor, right? You should be able...Excuse me... ...Please take care of the Captain.
