Who goes there!? Oh, Forename, it's you. Hm? Another delivery?
I'm not certain I should be the one to─ By Nophica, that's an anole egg! The troops will be glad indeed to see one of these at table! And you say Hearer Pauline sent you on this errand?
I hear the anoles are more numerous than ever, yet you appear to have managed the task with your skin intact. Your skill and bravery continue to amaze me, Forename.
Forename! Thank the gods you've come!
We have a potential crisis on our hands, and I would appreciate your assistance. Will you hear me out?
Listen well, for we haven't much time.
To the southeast of here lies a dungeon known as Spirithold. It was all but destroyed during the Calamity.
Desiring to offer the ruins back to the forest, a Hearer ventured inside to carry out the Rite of Returning.
Alas, it would seem something has gone awry. Word arrived just moments ago that the Hearer and his guards have been attacked by a towering shadow. Aye, you heard me true─a shadow.
On any other day, I would dispatch my best Quivermen to provide support, but I sent them to repel an Ixali incursion in the West Shroud nary a bell ago.
The timing of these events cannot be mere coincidence. I fear the Ixal somehow caught wind of our plans, and are attempting to disrupt the rite in an effort to weaken the bond between man and elemental.
They must not be allowed to succeed. And so I bid you go to Spirithold and do whatever is necessary to resolve the situation. Please, say you will help us.
I knew you would not let me down. You will have all the support I can muster.
Now, we are racing against time, so you had best make haste.
