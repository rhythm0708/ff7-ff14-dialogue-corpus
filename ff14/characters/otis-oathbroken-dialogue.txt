For the honor of the royal knights! Forward!
Snap out of it, Otis! Don't you recognize us!?
First formation! Show them a knight's valor!
We need to spread out!
For honor!
The machines obey him!
Second formation! Seize the glory of victory!
Everyone, gather close!
We will not fall!
Something about him is familiar... But...it couldn't be...
Third formation! Onward, for Alexandria!
It is himâ”€the captain of the knights!
Don't like the looks of this... Everyone, keep your guard up!
Feel the sting of my blade!
Damn it... How do we bring him to his senses!?
If he still remembers me, then perhaps...
...protect...Her Majesty...
Right, he's deactivated.
It should be safe to approach.
Otis! No!
I remember you, Otis. So please, remember yourself.
You're a proud knight of Alexandria. A man who lives to serve the kingdom and its subjects!
Otis!
Pray stand back, Your Majesty.
I am Ser Otis Velona, lord captain of the royal knights of Alexandria!
Upon mine honor, you shall harm neither my fair queen nor our citizens!
