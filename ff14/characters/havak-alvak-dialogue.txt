I am Havak Alvak, a self-styled student of sundry subjects. Though I am best known, perhaps, for putting pen to parchment for a popular paper, the Mythril Eye.
In these times of trials and tribulations, a subject of singular strangeness has ensnared my senses─magical monstrosities, more commonly known as “golems.”
But I speak now of no common creation of magecraft. No, these shambling servants of stone have no equivalent in all of Eorzea.
Should these curious constructions contain ores of extraordinary origin...well, I can only imagine the influence it might exert over Ul'dah's economy.
Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern has come to a congruent conclusion, and its superiors seek a savvy adventurer to separate the facts from the fantastic.
A representative of Amajina & Sons awaits outside Arrzaneth Ossuary. If exploring this enigma seems an entertaining endeavor, then I would wander over before this window of opportunity is wasted!
The city is verily vibrating with vivacity. Ever was Ul'dah a scene for stimulating the senses.
