Captain! Ungh... Trouble...at the shipyard... <pant>
Easy now, soldier. Who did this to you?
<pant> Pirates... Out of nowhere... <cough> Stuck me good...
Gods below, we are not prepared for this!
The pirates, soldier, how many do they number?
Not sure... More than I could quickly count... Seemed to be carrying...explosives...
Explosives!? Then there is no time to lose!
Forename, you heard the situation. Make your way to the shipyard and engage these intruders!
I will see to this man's wounds, then follow after.
Make haste, now!
