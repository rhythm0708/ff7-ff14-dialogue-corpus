You are exchanging tongueflaps with her right now. Rediroq is the elector you seek.
Oh, that's helpful! We can cut straight to performing the feat!
As much as Rediroq would like to do just that, we have a much more pressing worry.
The storm which hit our village shattered the cliffs and dropped rocks on our braincases! Many helphands for the potsworn were injured. This is no time for feats or mettletests!
I'm sorry to hear that. After learning what the storm did to the stairs, I feared you'd been caught in its path. Uh, not to change the subject, but...what are the “potsworn”?
Goldsmiths contracted to work for the Moblins. The word comes from the pot-like workshops where they practice their craft.
The Moblins provide these potsworn with tools, materials, living quarters─everything the artisans could possibly need. This allows them to concentrate on producing what is widely known as the finest gold- and metalwork in Tural.
