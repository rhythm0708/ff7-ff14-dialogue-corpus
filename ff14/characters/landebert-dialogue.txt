Whispers on the street say your organization is funded by corrupt coin─by Syndicate money. If you think you're recruiting for a just cause, then you're a bigger fool than I took you for.
Oh, what a happy coincidence! Do you remember me, perchance? I am Ourcen, of the Church of Saint Adama Landama. Thank you again for your timely rescue.
And I must also thank you for preventing that fraudulent priest from preying on Drybone's less fortunate. A most upsetting business. Are you here with your companion─Thancred, wasn't it?
...Ah, 'tis new companions you seek, then. Your proposed organization sounds a powerful force for good, but my place is at the church with the children. Nevertheless, I wish you well in this undertaking.
