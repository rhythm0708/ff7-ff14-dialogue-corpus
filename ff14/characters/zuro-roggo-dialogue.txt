Croaaak! Who dares approach the tower!?Ones with ears to listen!? How wonderful!
They must provide excellent board here.
It's...it's not easy being... <croak>
I pray I never hear that song again...
Right, into the aether we go.
Is this it, then? The aetherial sea?
This is the shore, you might say.
More homunculi!
We'll deal with them like the rest.
All these spriggans here...
I imagine they were drawn to the crystals.
That was tougher than I expected...
Come, the lowest level awaits.
Even the candles burn upside down...
How very Sharlayan to obsess over useless details.
Defenses for the innermost sector, eh?
Can't lower our guard even for a moment!
