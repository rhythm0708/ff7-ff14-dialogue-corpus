Gods, what I wouldn't give to unsee that horrible sight!
Going after that enormous beast, are you?
Aye, I saw it...including the very instant that poor bastard transformed! Damn the gods for putting me there!
It started over there, by the window. A few men, merchants, probably. Talking and drinking.
Conversation must've taken a turn for the worse. Next thing I know, their leader─I suppose he was─buries his head in his hands, and black mist was swirling about him!
Then his whole body...bursts apart, and there stands a hideous, slavering beast... Massive and foul...all gaping maws and bulging eyes!
His friends start shrieking, then the black mist comes again, until the change takes them too... The stuff of nightmares, I tell you...
Nightmarish, indeed... Incidentally, do you perchance know who those merchants were?
No, I'm a decorator by trade. Not much cause to mingle with their sort.
Saw Mihleel the barmaid chatting with them, though. She might know something.
By the time it was done, every last man at their table had turned into some hideous thing. The rest of us were lucky to escape with our lives...
