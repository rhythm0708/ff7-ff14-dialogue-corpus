I, Ser Grinnaux de Dzemael, brother of the Heavens' Ward, did bear witness to these two foreigners consorting with heretics!
Let the accused step forward!
Alphinaud Leveilleur, Tataru Taru─you have heard the charges leveled against you.
Will you take up arms to refute Ser Grinnaux's claim and thereby prove your innocence in the eyes of gods and men?
I, Alphinaud Leveilleur, am innocent of this charge, and claim my right to trial by combat!
I, Tataru Taru, am innocent of this charge...
But I am no warrior, and cannot fight, so I claim the right to name a champion!
To the old and the infirm, the young and the weak, this right we allow. Very well. Who will stand for this woman?
Just as I was beginning to doubt the efficacy of the Ishgardian justice system! Come, my friend─let us put an end to this mummer's farce!
O Halone, render unto us Your judgment! Raise up the righteous, and cast down the wicked!
I shall do what I can to support you, Forename! Now, let us teach these noble sers the folly of bearing false witness!
