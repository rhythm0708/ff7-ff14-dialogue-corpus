Come to join? Sorry, but you're too late.
Some Brass Blades looking for extra coin volunteered, and the team's already en route to the ruins.
But look, I know it's not easy to find work these days. If you're interested, there's something else you can do for me.
There are these children outsideâ”€little ones from Stonesthrow. I look after them when I've time to spare, and so they've taken to following me around, even when I tell them not to.
But what with overseeing the search for the vein, I barely have a chance to visit the privy at the moment, much less entertain younglings. Can you give them these ginger cookies and convince them to go home for me?
