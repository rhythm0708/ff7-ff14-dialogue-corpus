Water is love, water is life! Drink up, ye parched souls!
Is that a Fuath? What is it doing?
Making their minions stronger, by the looks of it.
A Fuath! And it's...watering the plants?
Such breathtaking scenery...
Oh, my! Did you see the flowers?
Stay focused, Minfilia.
There'll be no wilted flowers on my watch!
