I'm afraid I've finished with my tasks for the time being. But since you're so eager to learn about our way of life, why don't I tell you a bit about our migration customs?
If you're here, you likely already know that the rroneek are our hhetso─our guides─that we travel with through the turning of the seasons. We trust them to lead us to fertile lands with all we need to survive.
But you may not know that sometimes, the herd splits into two, bound for different paths. On those occasions, we Hhetsarro must also part with half of our number.
You may think it a strange and stressful custom, but over the years, it has seen us visit new lands and broaden our horizons as a people. This, too, is the wisdom of the hhetso.
One more tidbit for you. When the herd splits, and we part with our kin, we exchange a wish to meet again wheresoever we are guided: “Tseppya ashees ahhetsarro nhheyoan!”
