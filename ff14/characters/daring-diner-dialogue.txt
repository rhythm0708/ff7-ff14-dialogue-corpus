What? What's happening?
Compliments of Mistress Zero, the satrap's honored guest, we are serving a special curry for anyone who wishes to partake. But be warned: it is not for the faint of heart!
Oh! By all means, I'd welcome the challenge!
Sisters have mercy...the smell alone is...
It burns! It burns!
To better maintain the facade, the alchemists ensured that my vessel was capable of consuming food...
However, I fear Zero's curry would test the limits of their design.
Apologies for the delay. Please relax and enjoy your meal.
“Relax”? I don't have time for that. I've been waiting for this...
Come, let's replenish our aether.
I trust you have eaten your fill.
I shall have Mehryde prepare a meal for us to take to Estinien. I suspect he too is overdue a “replenishment.”
By this hour, he will have retired to his chambers at Meghaduta. Come, let us pay him a visit.

Well, that proved to be an exciting event! I daresay word of Zero's singular curry will draw more diners to our establishment.
My poor nose... It still tingles...
By the Sisters, I thought that curry would be the end of me. I...I must eat it again.
What a remarkable curry! I must try a bowl myself─when I can muster the courage, that is!
Quite an adventurous crowd we had today. A few drinks will do that to you. For better or worse...
