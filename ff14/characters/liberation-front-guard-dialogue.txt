You are Forename Surname, are you not? We were told of your coming.
Heroes of Eorzea, we of the Doman Liberation Front are honored to receive you. If you would be so good as to follow me...
This is the House of the Fierce? But there are so few of them...
Many kindred spirits remain in hiding following the rebellion. Many others gave their lives for their nation. We are the stubborn remainder.
Even accounting for our comrades in the field, we are at a fraction of our former strength, 'tis true. Yet we few are patriots─brothers-in-arms, prepared to fight with every fiber of our being to set our people free.
Ever are we hopeful that others will join our cause. But never did I dream that you would journey so far.
Yugiri! Gods, it's good to see you! You look great, by the way!Have you been here long?
I returned but recently, having concluded my mission.Oh, it is good to see you again, my friends.
Did I hear aright? Your mission is concluded?Then you have found the young master?
Ere we speak of that, I would know by what fortuitous circumstance our friends came to be here.
The Empire's crimes are all too familiar. Lyse─my heart goes out to your people.
We wanted to stay and fight, believe me, but we knew it wouldn't work.We needed more time to rebuild─and more allies to stand with us againstthe Empire.
So we decided to come here and help you free Doma. To show you─to show everyone─that you're not alone, and that the Garleans can be beaten, if we work together. I'd like to think we proved that in the Ruby Sea...
That you did, Lyse, and far more besides. Needless to say, your assistance would be most welcome.
Hear, hear! Now then, Yugiri─you must tell me of your search for our master!
Lest you wonder, he speaks of Lord Hien, son of Lord Kaien, who perished during the rebellion.
When it became clear that all hope of victory had gone, Lord Hien bade us deliver as many of our people as we could to safety beyond our borders. But as his father's heir, he was determined to fight on, and so he did─until he suffered a grievous wound in battle and vanished without a trace...
Until now. For I have found Lord Hien─seen and spoken with him.On the Azim Steppe.
O boundless and merciful kami, the young master lives!Tell me, was he well? Did his wound yet ail him? Where is he now?Have you brought him back to us!?
You may take comfort in the knowledge that he is hale and whole. However, when I invited him to return with me to Doma, he had this to say...
“If Doma yet thirsts for the blood of patriots and tyrants, I shall offer unto her my blade. But if she has had her fill of bitter draughts, I shall offer unto her conquerors my head.”
Thrice did I declare to him that no true son or daughter of Doma would ever accept such a sacrifice. But for all my passion, he would not be swayed.
“Learn the truth of her heart and return to me,” he said. And so I left him.
The words of one made to wear the mantle of leadership too soon...
Yet there is wisdom in them all the same. If the people no longer yearn to be free, 'twould be folly to rekindle the fires of war.
To suffer our master to surrender his life and forsake all hope of freedom is by far the greater folly. I will not go to face my fallen comrades having done naught to stop it.
Nor I, shadow walker, nor I. But we need not rouse our comrades to battlethis day. Let us instead welcome our honored guests and allow them amoment of respite.
As you can see, they went to great lengths to disable the aetheryte. Apparently, in the twilight days of the rebellion, they feared that Zenos would be willing to risk sending unattuned conscripts.
That said, it is hardly irreversible. They have the necessary materials. It would be a challenge to repair it alone, but mayhap with my brother's help...
You should hear this, Forename. He was just telling me about Zenos and the rebellion.
