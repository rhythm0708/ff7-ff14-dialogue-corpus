I need to stock up food and medicine. As much as I can. And what else is there? I can't afford to forget anything...
Sorry, misssir, but I'm busy. Too much to do and too little time.
There's no telling when those stone men will return. I have to get out of here, find somewhere safe.
Vow Wuk Lamat wants to speak to us?
Perhaps she has a plan, then. I suppose there's no harm in hearing what she has to say.
