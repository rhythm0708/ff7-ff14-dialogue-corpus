There she is!
Come here, girl!
That was close! They didn't hurt you, did they?
...Only my pride, Yda.
There will be others nearby. We must see that they are given a similarly warm welcome.
Commander Leveilleur!
There's been a development, sir! Together with the Temple Knights, we have secured the entrances to some half-dozen tunnels, after spotting the enemy breaking the surface. But that is not all, sir─we think that one of them may be important. Certainly, the heretics near flung themselves upon our swords to defend it.
A-ha! Just as I suspected! Amongst this warren of tunnels lies the entrance to Iceheart's lair! Summon the others─we're going in!
A moment, Alphinaud! The tunnel in question is barely wide enough for two men abreast. We cannot say with any certainty where it leads, much less what is waiting for us there.
Furthermore, we have no way of knowing how many heretics are still lurking here on the surface! What if they were to converge on this point after we entered the tunnel? For all we know, we could be funneling our forces into a trap!
...I take your point. If the tunnel is indeed as narrow as you say, greater numbers would be more a hindrance than a help. Should we encounter difficulty, our own allies would become an obstacle to escape.
Ahem! A change of plans. While we rendezvous with Ser Aymeric and keep the heretics at bay here, you will go wherever that tunnel leads.
If you find Iceheart at the end of it─do not let her escape.
You venture into the unknown, so see that you are prepared for anything. I suggest you call upon your allies─though not too many or Papalymo will sulk.
