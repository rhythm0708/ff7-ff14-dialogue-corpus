Ah, the guests of House Fortemps...accompanied by the Azure Dragoon, no less!
I cannot imagine what brought you out this far, but you are welcome to enter the tunnels if that is your will.
Assuming the Akh Afah beacon still functions─and we must pray to the Twelve it does─we shall arrive at our destination in mere moments.
Though I do not expect to be greeted by the primal Shiva, we should nevertheless be prepared for a frosty reception. ...The heretics are not like to rejoice at the appearance of uninvited guests─particularly ones with our history.
An impressive structure. I wonder how many ages it has endured...
Mayhap you should ask its occupants. They seem a friendly bunch.
Dogs of Ishgard! Is it not enough that you banish our beloved saint? Will you not be satisfied until the ice is slick with the last drops of our blood!?
Stay your weapons! We come under the flag of parley! We wish only to speak with your mistress, that we might broker a peace!
Do you think us fools, boy!? It will take more than honeyed words to earn our trust. You walk with the dragonslayer, and we know all too well what he is capable of!
My reputation precedes me...
<sigh> ...They give us little choice.
Come, brothers! May dragon wings bear us to victory!
