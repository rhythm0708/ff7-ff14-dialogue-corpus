In all things, it's nice to be able to make changes to better suit your taste. But by the same token, the more choices one has, the more difficult it is to decide what to do.
We began posting guides on the message board as a way to answer questions from adventurers; before we knew it, we had surpassed two hundred items. We couldn't have kept at it for so long without your invaluable feedback.
It makes us truly happy when we hear that we could help to solve your problems, even in some small way. Encouraged by your praise and driven by your requests, we'll keep working hard to serve you.
Should you have any comments or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach out. We always appreciate hearing from you!Informatively yours,A Humble Guide
