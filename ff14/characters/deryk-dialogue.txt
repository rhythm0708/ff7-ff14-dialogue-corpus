I knew it was you. I could tell it from your bearing.
Forgive me. It gladdens me that our paths should cross again, of course...and yet I find myself somewhat...lost for words...
Are you...well? What brings you here?
...Is that so? I should have known it. It is very much like you to help others fulfill their dreams. To bring life and light to the world.
I always liked festivals, as did all my brethren. Though the celebrations have taken divers forms over the years, all brought smiles to the faces of our children─and in turn, us.
Though it was our custom─nay, our duty─to watch over you from the phantom realm, one among us was so drawn to the music and the merrymaking that he adopted a mortal form, that he might join you in your revelry.
In every festival is imbued the hopes and dreams of mortal man. You implore the gods to listen to your pleas, and they hear you. They still do.
Till next our paths should cross.
