This one returns, and returns with good tidings! Wise ones have finished searching, and have wisely identified the precise location where the touched ones summoned Lord Ramuh!
Your timing is impeccable, my fluttery friend! Might you be so kind as to escort this good woman to her fellow Scions?
It would be this one's pleasure, walking one. Please, please come with this one!
Wise ones have ventured deep, deep within the Sylphlands. These ones must proceed carefully, and keep an eye out for touched ones.
This one is most sorry, but this one can go no further. Draw too close to Lord Ramuh, and this one may turn mean and nasty like touched ones!
And so this one must say farewell for now. Walking one will find wise ones not far from here, to the south. Go in safety, walking one.
...So it's actually you. I am relieved. For a moment, I thought we were dealing with another one of those confounded sylph tricksters.
I swear, with them wreaking havoc with their skin-changing magicks, it's a wonder I was able to finish taking my measurements.
Yes, it was quite the ordeal. You should have seen the look on Y'shtola's face when the one impersonating you suddenly showed up...
...That's quite enough, Papalymo.
...Ahem. My apologies. It's not like me to ramble so.
At any rate, as I was saying, I have finished measuring aetheric activity in the area, and am pleased to say I have reached an indisputable conclusionâ”€to wit, that Ramuh was called forth in the vicinity of the sylphs' aetheryte!
Come, Forename. The Lord of Levin awaits!
