General Aldynn, I presume, and the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.
Who are you!? Identify yourself!
Pray do not be alarmed. My mistress is a friend, and I come bearing a message of goodwill.
For your own safety, she bade me direct your steps to the Waking Sands. Know that Master Urianger awaits you there, along with others sympathetic to your cause.
This is no ruse, I assure you. General Aldynnâ”€if you will come with me, I have prepared a carriage, that you may travel in comfort, safe from prying eyes.
I have spoken with Urianger via linkpearl. He confirms the man's story.
Raubahn is in safe hands. Let us make our own way to Vesper Bay.
My dearest friends! Praise be unto the Twelve for delivering you from the clutches of treachery.
Father!
Pipin, my son... And Master Papashan besides...
Forgive me, Father... I should have been at Her Grace's side...
