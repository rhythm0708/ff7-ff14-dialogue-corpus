What are you starin' at!? You wanna keep them eyes in yer face?
Ugh! Nophica's teats, that's cold! What do you mean, “no fightin'”? This Duskwight scum was─
Yeah, yeah, I know the rules. That bastard gets to keep his skin...for now.
Nicely done, Forename. I'll not have my patrons picking fights with each other over a bit of petty prejudice.
In case you didn't see, the bloke who caught the brunt of that outburst is a Duskwight Elezen. They're a people who shun cities to live in the wilds, making them no better than brigands in the eyes of many.
To be fair, the Duskwights can be an unruly lot, but they ain't so bad once you get to know them. And it don't seem right to bar a whole race of people from the Druthers for the misdeeds of a few.
There should be at least one place where anyone willing to pay the coin and drink in peace is welcome, don't you think?
I appreciate all the good you've done for our patrons. If you aren't disinclined, I have a favor of my own to ask you.
There's a Qiqirn friend of mine, you see─name of Teteroon. A good lad. It was right after the Calamity that I came across him fallen in the Shroud. He nearly died in all the havoc. So, I took him in and nursed him back to health best I could.
He worked here at my Druthers for a spell after that. Got to talking about striking out on his own, he did, and not long after cast his lot with a merchant bound for La Noscea.
Well, it just so happens I got to cleaning up around here and came across something of his─this scarlet earring. I know he was fond of the thing, but he must have just forgotten it when he left. So, I'd like to see that it gets to him.
Can't say for sure where he ended up, but might be a friend of mine can. A Roegadyn fellow named Baensyng. You can find him on Hawkers' Alley in Limsa Lominsa. He knows everything of the comings and goings of merchants there.
