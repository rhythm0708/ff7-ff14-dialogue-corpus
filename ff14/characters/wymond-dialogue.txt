'Tis plain to anyone with eyes that you don't know your way around here.
If I let you go wanderin' off down the nearest dark alley, you're certain to get mugged or worse, an' I don't want that on my conscience.
So before you do anythin' else, you'll want to head over to the Quicksand, an' speak with Momodi. She's the master of the Adventurers' Guild, an' can set you on the right path.
Just take those steps over yonder an' pass through the double doors. You'll find her inside.
...An' that's as much as you're gettin' for free. Good luck with the adventurin', adventurer.
