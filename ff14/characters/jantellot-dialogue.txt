Well, well. What do we have here? Hoping to join the esteemed ranks of the Convictors, are we?
The hard-eyed lass looks promising, but you have a frail look about you, boy... I give you three days ere the wilds claim your corpse.
I beg your pardon...?
Be not so quick to judge. I have seen this “frail” youth fell heretics with a flick of his wrist.
And who are you to question my─ By the Fury!
That armor... That lance! The Azure Dragoon himself graces our camp!
Pray forgive my disrespect, ser. I am Jantellot─leader of the Convictors and fellow slayer of dragons.
...May I ask what winds─fair or foul─carry you into our humble camp?
Ah. Lady Iceheart, is it? Aye, I know her by reputation─but I'm afraid I've seen naught of her or her people.
That said, my own men can be...ahem...somewhat lax when it comes to making reports. You may wish to question them yourselves.
Thank you. We shall.
Forename, Estinien─let us make our way through the camp, and see what information there is to be had.
Surely one of these people will have encountered heretics while out hunting. Pray speak with as many as you can, Forename.
