It's hopeless! Hopeless!
No! No! Noooooo!
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Mother! I...I... Gaaahhhrrrgh!
I can't believe what I'm seeing...
Good gods...
All is in disarray...
The flames roar ever fiercer!
I can only pray some made it out alive...
I don't sense any aether!
It's up to us now!
Gods be good... The sky...
Over there, yes?
Over there, yes?
Vrtra is close... Still fighting in the skies above.
...
That was the worst of them...or at least, I hope it was.
I see no trace of the person it once was.
This must be the blasphemy they spoke of...
The horrors of Amaurot born anew...
