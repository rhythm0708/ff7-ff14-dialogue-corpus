Good gods, Elene'shpya!? It's been too long, my friend!
Where have you been all these years? What have you been doing with yourself?
Hold on... They say Queen Sphene has guests from outside the barrier. That's you, I gather?
It seems so. I'm looking for my motherâ”€do you know where she is?
Your mother?
Sorry, but what was she like again?
What? It's Cahciua. You know, the one who was too adventurous by half. Who journeyed with the Dawnservant.
Hmmm... It's not ringing any bells.
You can't be serious. Ours was a tiny little village. Surely you remember her!
I really don't... It's all a blank...
Is anyone else here from the village?
H-Hey!
