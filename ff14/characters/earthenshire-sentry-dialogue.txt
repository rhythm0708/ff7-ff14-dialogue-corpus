Pfff... Kohhh... The Third Promise? Mobbie has been standing at his post with diligent eyewatchingsâ”€he has seen no claimants pass this way.
What of a Tonawawta with brightly colored hair?
Mobbie knows something of this one! He hears tongueflaps about a Pelu peddler in Many Fires who was attacked by a crazyhair bandit on the road!
A bandit, you say...? Thank you, you've been most helpful.
My sister is clearly not here. Though I wish it were otherwise, we must consider the possibility that the Tonawawtan messenger and the brigand described by the sentry are one and the same, and that Lamaty'i is in very real danger.
Come, let us hurry to Many Fires. I'd like a word with this peddler should they still be around.
Pfff... Kohhh... Mobbies' bandit problem is only getting worse!
Here, Forename. This is the merchant who ran afoul of the bandit.
