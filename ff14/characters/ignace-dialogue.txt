Your friend is lost in the wilderness, you say?
If he's not to be found around here or in the vicinity of the Darkhold, it is possible he made for Whitebrim.
To reach it, one must travel through Daniffen Pass, the southern end of which lies to the north and east of here.
While I make no guarantee that your search will bear fruit, it is surely better than worrying in idleness. I wish you luck.
...Oh, and one more thing. Do tread warily when climbing the stairs here. Not a moon ago, I near broke my neck when I slipped and took a tumble.
Forename! We've found Biggs, but he's in trouble!
Our orders are to take you back, dead or alive! Which will it be, Engineer?
Why don't you come and find out, tin-head!?
Ah, Forename, it is well that you are here. The situation is grave.
Biggs is in a bad way! We need to do something, right now!
Yda has the right of it. He will perish if we delay.
With me!
He's not alone! Kill them all!
H-How did you know where to find me?
