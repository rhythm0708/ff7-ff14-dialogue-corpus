You are traveling with Master Garlond, miss? The Enterprise Excelsior is right this way.
Not quite a door-to-door service, but I couldn't exactly land her in the Toll's main square...
Shall we adjourn to the Rising Stones, then?
Hm. So these are the fabled headquarters of the Scions... I confess, I would have expected an order of self-proclaimed warrior-scholars to surround themselves with the fruits of man's enlightenment. And yet there is not so much as a single piece of magitek in sight.
It never ceases to amaze me how primitive you Eorzeans truly are...
Hmph! I'll have you know that the Rising Stones is home to the very latest in magitek innovation.
Wedge calls it the “Mark XIV Thermocoil Boilmaster,” and it's the finest kettle I've ever had the pleasure to own.
We are returned.
Well, Yda and I, at least. Y'shtola and the others remained behind to continue their assessment of the binding magick.
There didn't seem much point staying just for that, so I decided to come back with Alphinaud. Papalymo bought us this time. We shouldn't waste it.
By your leave!
Good gods. That voice could fell a gigas...
This is the Rising Stones, domicile of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn? I enter at the invitation of one Lord Urianger!
Ho-ho! I spy you there, shadow walker. You always were a hard one to find!
Yugiri...? Do you know this man?
Gosetsu!? Why are you come to Eorzea?
In search of you, Yugiri! For days and nights did I row across the angry sea...
I made port in good spirits, only for my own flesh to betray me over the trifling matter of an empty belly! Collapsed in the street like an unfed stray, I was, until Lord Urianger came to my aid.
Over a most welcome meal, we spoke of the plight of Doma, and I learned of our displaced countrymen's work to resettle this blighted land. 'Twas blind fortune I was able to locate you so swiftly!
But now we must make ready to depart! Our master languishes in dire peril, and Doma calls her daughter home!
It is not so simple, Gosetsu. There are obligations which bind me here...
You─ You refuse? Did you mislay your oath during your flight from our homeland? The laws of hospitality must be honored, but surely the vow to defend your master demands the greater obeisance!
It was our master who bid me guide our people to safe haven by any means necessary. And it was the Scions you see before you who provided us succor and sanctuary when all others refused.Dire peril or no, were I to return without first repaying such “hospitality,” our master would cut me down at the threshold.
Mayhap that is so...
There is more. A crisis threatens all within this realm, Eorzean and Doman alike, and I go to play my part in its resolution. I will not bring shame upon our liege by abandoning my people or my duty.
How very noble of you. Now, in the name of honor, kinship, and─ah, yes─practicality, might I suggest we get this expedition underway? Or would you rather debate the finer points of duty and leave Omega to the Empire?
The Empire!?
Yugiri? You draw steel against the curs of Garlemald?
Then why did you not say so!? My blade is oathbound to fall upon the ranks of the imperials wheresoever they march! Lead on, shadow walker. And may the enemy tremble at our coming!
Forename, wait! Could I speak to you for a moment?
Do you remember when I had you meet me at the Diamond Forge, and we, uh...ambushed you?
Well, once we had your measurements, I set to work making you a traveling outfit in my spare time. I've only just this moment finished the stitching, but I wanted you to have it before you left. Here!
You can try it on right now, if you like!
Assuming we measured correctly, the fit should be just right. Snug but not too snug, if you know what I mean...?Sooo...how does it feel?
You're not just saying that, are you!? Oh, I can't tell you how much this means to me! To have crafted something worthy of the Warrior of Light is... It's─ Well, let's just say it makes all the practice worthwhile.
I also sewed in a blood pearl charm to...you know...bring you home. May it always protect you.
So we have to wake Omega up, right? When do we start?
Yda, you... Are you sure that's...?
I'm sure, yes. I won't lie and say I'm completely fine, but I'll feel a lot better if I'm doing something useful.
Very well. I will remain here and continue coordinating our efforts with the Alliance. Alphinaud, mayhap you could return to Gridania and assist Y'shtola and Krile?
A fine suggestion.
The rest of us will form the Carteneau expedition party. Nero and I will focus on rousing Omega, while Forename, Yda, and our Doman friends take care of security.
The Excelsior is by the lake just outside town. We'll leave as soon as everyone is ready.
We haven't far to go─with any luck, we'll be in Carteneau before Gosetsu graces the deck with his dinner.
Once there, however, we had best be on our guard. Given that Eline Roaille was still active when Omega was discovered, we can be sure that the Empire has long been aware of its existence. And if Nero deemed it the obvious solution to the threat posed by this new primal, it is not impossible that Garlemald might do the same.
Have your weapons ready and your wits about you. Something tells me we're flying into a fight.
Now where was the...? Ah!
I've enabled the teleporter. One brief jump, and we shall arrive in Omega's control room.
How convenient. ...You've been here before.
Of course. 'Twas no easy task threading a path through all the skirmishers...
But how could I ignore the existence of such a fascinating toy! You may trust that my preliminary examination was suitably thorough.
Trust? Aye. I trust your appetite for technology.
