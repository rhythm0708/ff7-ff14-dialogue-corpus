Visitors? Now there's a surprise.
Khalzahl, you say? Yes, I've known him since he was a boy.
If there was ever a man who was born to be a merchant, it was him. Always early to depart and late to return, he'd spend his days procuring the finest wares and seeking out willing customers. You could say it came to him as easily as breathing.
Sadly, business was flagging of late. No surprise, really, what with how dangerous travel has become. He was cooped up in his house from dawn till dusk the other dayâ”€no doubt wracking his brain for a way to turn his fortunes around.
Then, at night, I heard the door open. I looked out to see Khalzahl sitting on a bench, his head hung low. A man with the weight of the world on his shoulders...
I see. The situation must have been quite dire, indeed...
Did you notice anything else out of the ordinary?
Nothing to speak of. Other than the troubles with his consortium, he was the same old Khalzahl. Cordial and honest, like always.
These questions you are asking...has something happened to him? He wasn't caught up in that terrible incident at the bazaar, was he?
I don't travel much these days, but my daughter's told me not to venture outside. Stuck in here as I am, I've heard little about these bizarre goings-on.
Rest assured, the city is safe for now, but the situation may change without warning.
I urge you: stay close to your daughter, and be prepared to take refuge should the satrap order it.
Yes, I shall do just that. Thank you for your concern, and pray stay safe as well.
