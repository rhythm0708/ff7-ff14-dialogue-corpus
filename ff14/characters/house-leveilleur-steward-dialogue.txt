Welcome home, my lady.
What? What are you gawping at?
Oh gods, please don't! It makes me feel like a spoiled princess.
I'll have you know I'm quite fond of the Rising Stones!
Oh, I...I suppose I never gave the d√©cor much thought. I'm glad that you approve. I think.
Lord Fourchenault is not to hear of this visit.
And I should also like the children to have their gifts ere my husband makes his return.
As you wish, my lady.
