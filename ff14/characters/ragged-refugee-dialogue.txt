Halone's blessings be upon you, Father.
I confess, we were not sure if we should come. There are so many unbelievable tales these daysâ”€about the archbishop, and Ser Aymeric, and the Dravanians...
Trust in your heart, brother, and pay no heed to the lies of lesser men. They seek only to lead you astray.
Do you require succor as well, miss?
So the Temple Knights have begun their investigation at last! Good. This madness has gone on far too long.
Would that I could do something to aid you in your search, but I have a duty to these poor souls. Farewell, and may the Fury guide your steps.
Ah, there you are. Anything to share?
Hmph. We will require more than the muddled testimony of a traumatized girl if we are to identify the culprits...
While you were questioning the refugees, we inspected the scenes of several of the fires, including one near Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral and another near the Tribunal. For a mercy, neither structure suffered significant damage.
Some might say they were spared by the grace of the Fury. Others might question how such ruthlessly efficient arsonists contrived to fail so miserably on the two occasions when their target was a bastion of Ishgardian orthodoxy.
Nothing conclusive, of course, but it does give one cause to wonder. Alphinaud will doubtless have an opinion.
Silence will avail you naught, sir.
Ah, Forename! I was just about to summon you. As you can see, we have detained a suspect.
We found this man loitering near the remains of one of the stricken buildings. According to eyewitnesses, he was also present before the fires broke out.
We wished to have words; he did not. So we insisted.
