I cannot say, my lady! That monstrosity appears to be disrupting our communications!
We must keep trying. Call till they respond.
Yes, my lady!
Admiral, Generalâ”€we can do no more. We must give the order to withdraw.
I will not forsake Louisoix!
General, please! Victory may belong to the bold, but there will be no victor this day!
You know this to be true. Let us not sacrifice lives in vain.
The adventurers fight bravely, but to no avail. Let them withdraw, and let us be the ones to stand with Louisoix.
Belay previous orders! All Maelstrom units are commanded to fall back, effective immediately!
Give the Foreign Levy priority! Let the main host cover their retreat, and bring up the rear!
Damn it... Relay the order: all Flames are to withdraw.
I don't care if our linkshells are useless!
You still have a working pair of legs, don't you!? Well, use 'em, you bloody half-wit!
The outcome of this battle was long since decided.
Better to retreat now, than risk a massacre.
This dark, stifling presence... Who...or what...?
We go to take our place beside Archon Louisoix! To your positions!
