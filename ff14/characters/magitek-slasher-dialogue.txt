Ungh...Someone, help...
You've not been turned? Thank goodness... I thought I was the only one left.
Ungh...the bastards got my hand when they took down my magitek reaper. If you can repair its leg, though, it should still work. Here, take this key.
If it's run out of ceruleum, you might be able to find more in the wreckage.
If I had the use of my hand, I might've stood a chance out there. Please, send help if you can!
Please...don't leave me to die here.
As for me, I've got no choice but to wait for help to arrive. If you find any of my comrades...let them know where I am, would you?
