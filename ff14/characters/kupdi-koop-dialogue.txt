Enough! Kuplo Kopp will answer for his crimes soon enough, as will all who defy the will of Good King Moggle Mog XII─may he reign forevermore, kupo!
The king is planning to purge the Twelveswood of his enemies, kupo! We've got to stop him before it's too late!
The entrance to Thornmarch is deep within the Bramble Patch, kupo! If you take me there, I can nullify the ward. But be warned: the Mogglesguard has set traps to lure enchanted beasts. I can't hide from them, so you'll need to protect me, kupo!
We're here, kupo! I don't see any more beasts, do you?
Are you ready to face the king, kupo? Then step closer to the ward.
Raise your hand and focus─like when you attune to an aetheryte, kupo! I'll open the way for you!
The rest is up to you, kupo! Now go and teach those foolish moogles a lesson and send the king back whence he came!
Kupo?! Who in the seven hells are they!?
