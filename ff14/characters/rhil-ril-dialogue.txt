You wish to go to Nabaath Areng? Hm...
There was a way, once. A gondola down from the cliffs. But it was built for those who had left something behind that they wished to retrieve. Now there is nothing left, and no one to use it.
You may search for it, if you like. But I doubt that its rusted wires would bear your weight.
