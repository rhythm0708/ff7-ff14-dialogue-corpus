Well, you certainly look the part of an adventurer, my friend. Might you be the good soul Momodi advised me to expect, hm?
I am Papashan, stationmaster of this humble Dispatch Yard.
An empty title, I assure you. I truly am no more than a tired old Lalafell passing his final years in quiet and solitude.
Twelve know there have been plenty of both these last five years since the Calamity struck. The devastation...was vast.
Yet now true Ul'dahns work together, doing all in our power to rebuild what was laid to ruin. By the sweat of our brows and the love of our home, we have rebuilt Ul'dah to the grandeur and majesty that you see today.
The railways which run through this Dispatch Yard, too, were born of the noble efforts of a great many souls.
But there is still much work to be done. The wounds left by the Calamity run deep. Isolated areas beyond our lines of supply remain, and there are places yet wanting for relief and restoration.
Ul'dah needs the aid of you and your brethren, friend. In fact, never has our need been more dire.
Which brings me to the point, I suppose. I do believe I may have some work suited to one of your ability.
Since you've come all this way, perhaps you can perform an errand for me.
It just so happens a number of sentries have been sent to guard the area. A dispatch to the Dispatch Yard, as it were.
They have long been away from the shade and featherbeds of the city. The hot days and cold nights can play hells on the mind and body out here.
It isn't much, but go and give them these twilight pretzels, would you? I find comfort food always helps when I feel like killing myself.
