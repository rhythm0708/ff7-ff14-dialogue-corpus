No mercy, eh?
Blades of fire rain.
I-I'm fine, I'm fine!

Huh!? I-I can't move!
This isn't good.
These magicks are too strong!
Curses...
Some manner of paralyzing effectâ”€defend the afflicted!
We must free them! Target the constricting flames!
None can outrun my flames.
For Lamaty'i!
Not enough... But together, we shall triumph!
