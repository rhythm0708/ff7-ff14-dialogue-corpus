Hm? Yes?

Er...I'm sure your bosom fish are very fresh, but this is rather sudden... I don't need any fish right now, so thanks but no thanks.

N-Never mind, it never goes well the first time. I'm sure you'll fare better with the next customer!
Greetings to you too. <sigh> I suppose I'm well enough given the circumstance...
Things have settled down somewhat, but it was utter chaos when that tower first appeared. Everyone grabbing whatever they could, trampling over each other to get to the city...
Many remain there for now, but I could not stay away. Had to come back─continue with my life, such as it is.
Whether or not it was the right choice...only time will tell.
Well, I make sure to keep well clear of the tower. And when more monsters emerge from it, I heed the Radiant Host's instructions.
No place safer than the city, of course, but if everyone up and left, what would happen to Yedlihmad? Dangerous though it may be, I'll keep doing what I've always done, to the extent I can.
What do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?
Well now, a fishmonger! Do you have your goods with you? If so, I'd like to buy some.
Like me, you're doing your part to keep things normal. I respect that.
Th-Thank you for your custom! The catch of the day is shallows cod—delectable stewed in coconut milk, or baked with a sprinkle of salt.

You too, friend. And best of luck to us both.

N-Never mind. Sale or no, the way you established a rapport was very enlightening. Come, let's find another potential customer!
Oh, trust me, I don't. I make sure to keep well clear of the tower, and when more monsters emerge from it, I heed the Radiant Host's instructions.
I hope they deal with it soon so we can get back to our normal lives. To the days when you could earn as much as you gave, and tuck into a meal satisfied that you did good work...
Hm? Fresh fish, you say?
Ohhh, you're a fishmonger!
Heh, when you bait me like that, how can I not bite? Very well, give me some of your fish!

That was just the first person, so not to worry. We still have plenty of opportunities.
That you should make a sale on the first attempt... I've learned a lot already, and I hope to learn more still!
O-Oh, did you have other things you needed to do? In that case, I'll head back to the pier for now...
Not many visit here from other shores anymore. Even Alnair has seen few merchant ships in its docks, and has felt the loss of coin they bring most keenly.
