You must be the 'venturer Miounne sent word about. I'm Keitha, head wrangler 'round these parts.
I've heard many and more things about you─good things, lest you worry.
When the Elder Seedseer bade us welcome 'venturers, 'tis fair to say we had our doubts─till hardworkin' folk like yourself set about provin' us wrong, that is. Consider me a convert!
Anyroad, you've a mind to help out at the ranch, have you? Good. We could always do with a hand or two to keep the place runnin' smoothly.
As a matter of fact, I've a task right here that wants doin'.
Let me know when you're ready to get busy. Oh, and you come highly recommended, so don't go lettin' no one down, eh?
Seven hells! Some bastard Qiqirn has gone and broken one of me chocobo eggs!
The filthy little thief was busy lootin' the barn when a guard startled it, promptin' the damn thing to drop the egg it was clutchin' and run. Some of the lads gave chase, bless 'em, but when three more of the vermin appeared, me lot had no choice but to turn back.
Somethin' has to be done about those Qiqirn... Would you mind headin' over to the Matron's Lethe and havin' a word with a soldier named Roseline for me? The ratmen nest in her neck of the woods, see... She'll know what to do.
