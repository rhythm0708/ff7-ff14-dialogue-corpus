Oh, hello there. A fresh register, are we? You seem a little lost.
Well, 'tis lovely to make your acquaintance. Ahem, speaking of acquaintances, you wouldn't happen to have run into my attendant on your wanderings, would you? Big strong lad? Long hair, tied back?
He was escorting me on a shopping errand when I realized I'd dropped my handkerchief. And now I've been waiting here all alone while he's been off searching for it.
I'm not terribly fond of being alone. If you do see him, I would be obliged if you could pass on this message: forget the silly handkerchief and return to my side at once!
