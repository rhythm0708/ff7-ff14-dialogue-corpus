...No, the name doesn't ring any bells. But there was a rather dapper-looking Mystel gentleman here not long ago. He wanted to talk about relations between Wright and Eulmore─or rather the lack of them.
We lost a great many people to their promises of meol and the chance of a lavish life among the free.
And Vauthry thought to take even more from us, conscripting the few able-bodied men we had left to guard his paradise.
I needn't tell you what happened when the sin eaters came... Such things are hard to forgive.
But Vauthry's gone now, and we're curious to see what will become of Eulmore in his absence.
That's what I told your friend...Chai-Nuzz, was it? And I'm sure the others said the same. Not what he wanted to hear, I suppose, because he left soon after. And that was that.
So he paid a visit to both Wright and Gatetown as well, did he?
I see. Kai-Shirr and I gleaned much the same.
He seems determined to salvage what goodwill might yet remain among the settlements of Kholusia, the only likely place he has left to go being Amity.
Come. If we are quick, we may yet catch up with him.
Forename! Alphinaud! Kai-Shirr! Wh-What are you doing here!?
We might ask you the same, Master Chai. We have been looking all over for you.
Looking for me? Whatever for?
Lady Chai has been nigh inconsolable in your absence. She claims you disappeared without so much as a word, and bade us return you to her side.
What in blazes are you talking about? I left a letter for her in our chambers.
Though I suppose she could have overlooked it... And when she gets an idea into her head... <sigh> I can only apologize.
No harm done, Master Chai. But since we are here, might I ask what compelled you to come all this way?
We were told you had been elected mayor, and from what we have gathered from the nearby villages, you have been inquiring about the people's grievances.
Is it safe to assume you mean to take office?
Now, now, let's not jump to conclusions!
I did seek to learn about the problems faced by the people of Kholusia, that much is true. But I am by no means sure I am the man to solve them.
Tackling our many challenges will require resources, and until I have secured them, it would not be right to assume the role of mayor.
I see. And you believe said resources can be found here?
Indeed. The people's grievances are many, but in the course of my inquiries, I have already met with several individuals willing to lend their aid in addressing them.
However, there remains one individual crucial to my plans. A man whose counsel might yet make a mayor of me.
With respect, such forethought is, in itself, proof of your suitability.
The city needs you, Master Chai. And I am certain this man of whom you speak─whoever he may be─will reach the same conclusion. For what little it is worth, we will vouch for you should he require convincing.
I...I don't know what to say...
You don't need to say anything. You've got your actions to speak for you.
For as long as I can remember, all I ever wanted was to make it into Eulmore. But that dream's gone now, burst like a bubble─or a boil, more like.
Anyway, outside of repaying Master Alphinaud, I haven't had a clue what to do with myself. Spent most days in a daze. But you? You've been running up and down, trying to find a way to fix this mess for everyone.
And I reckon you can do it. You got this lot up Mt. Gulg, didn't you? How hard could mayoring be? You're going to steer Eulmore to a better future, I know it.
And I want to help. Properly help. Do something that makes a difference.
I don't know what it is yet, but I'll work it out on the way. If you let me come with you, that is.
You give me entirely too much credit, the lot of you...but I can't deny it gives me heart. Come, then. Let us press on together.
Thank you, Master Chai!
But we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. Eulmore needs more than a man with good intentions. Which is why I am here─to find one with the experience needed to see the city thrive.
Who is this man, exactly, and are you certain he's here in Amity?
Wrenden is his name, and yes, he is. Or was. I had scarcely begun to explain myself when he decided his time was better spent elsewhere.
He served as chief advisor to Vauthry's father when he was in office.
If Ran'jit was the mayor's right hand, one might say Wrenden was the left, and between them, they kept Eulmore on the road to prosperity.
The city needs more than a mere man of business─which is why I must find him.
But even if you do, what makes you think he will listen?
Before giving chase, might it not be wise to speak with those who know him, here in Amity? They may be able to shed some light on his reason for rejecting your overtures out of hand.
Yes, I suppose that makes sense. Perhaps we should start with Tristol, then. As I recall, you made rather a favorable impression on him. I'm certain he would be willing to talk to us.
Greetings, friend. And to you too, Master Chai. I presume you are here to ask after Wrenden? I couldn't help overhearing your earlier...exchange.
Yes, well...with Vauthry gone, Eulmore wants for a leader. Should no one rise to the challenge, the city could very well collapse. I came here seeking Wrenden's counsel in the hope that we could build a better Eulmore together─and that is still my wish. But given how abominably you were mistreated there, I will quite understand if you choose not to help.
Worry not, Master Chai. I bear no grudge against you or the people of Eulmore, and I would not see you suffer for Vauthry's villainy.
As you no doubt gathered from your meeting earlier, Wrenden can be rather uncompromising. He has his principles, you see, and little patience for anyone he deems less committed to their own.
Your desire to right the wrongs of your past, of Eulmore's past, is quite admirable. But I fear the guilt you bear on the city's behalf works against you.
I can see it in your eyes, in the way you carry yourself. It goes without saying he sees it as well. You must let those feelings go, Master Chai. Be more assertive─commit to this course─and prove to him Eulmore has the resolve to change.
The resolve to change...
I believe he was heading towards Pit 8 when he left. If you plan to go and speak with him, I suggest you be firm and clear in your intentions.
Very well. To Pit 8 we shall go. And I will not take no for an answer. Nay, not even a maybe!
