I'll not forget this kindness. May we meet again!
Is that you, milady? Don't tell me we just deprived that poor fellow the honor of being rescued by the Warrior of Darkness! We had no idea you were in the area. Fancy us meeting again so soon, eh? Why, I believe I even recognize your companion.
...Ah yes! From the infirmary. You had a message for the Crystal Exarch, did you not? It's good to see you back on your feet─and on patrol, no less!
Oh, it's nothing as official as all that! Strictly speaking, we're off duty. But as we had a free moment, we thought we'd give a few of the less-traveled roads a look. The guard doesn't have enough hands to patrol them regularly, you see.
That's admirable. There are few so devoted to their duty─in Lakeland or beyond.
Well, we've been talking about it for a while, and neither of us is satisfied with just seeing out our service. It feels like we could be doing more─like we should be doing more.
