Well met, my good woman! My companion and I are delighted to make your acquaintance. He cannot speak like you and I, but I assure you, he is oh-so-fond of making new friends on this joyous, impish occasion.
What is the occasion, you ask? Why, the March of the Imps, of course! 'Tis a fresh new take on our annual celebration here at the Gold Saucer, as suggested by one of our staff.
When we first received word of it, we were rather baffled by the concept...but it seems to have left a positive impression on our guests!
To present our patrons with the most engaging experience possible, we've outfitted our attendants with impish attire. These costumed imps are free to frolic about the Saucer and bring joy to those they meet, with an adorable “squeee!” or a “ka-pa-paaa!”
“Why imps?” one might ask, and they would have good reason to do so! Alas, I myself was never told the exact reasoning.
But if you're keen to learn more of the March, I know just the imp who can assist you! He's the one who coined the idea for it, after all. I last saw him on the second floor at the Manderville Lounge. He may still be there, if you hurry.
If he should speak to you in the impish tongue, you needn't fret. He's particularly unique, even among his brethren, and he makes his intentions quite clear to those not versed in impspeak.
If you're searching for the imp I spoke of, you should be able to find him at the Manderville Lounge. He may still be there, if you hurry.
Squeee...
Ka-paaa? Ka-pa-paaa!
Ka-paaa? Ka-pa-paaa!
Ka-paaa? Ka-pa-paaa!
Squee-hee! Ka-pa-paaa!
