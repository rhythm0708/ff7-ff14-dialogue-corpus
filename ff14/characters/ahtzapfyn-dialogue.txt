Gahahaha! Never reckoned it'd be this easy! Still don't trust those slimy bastards, but their plan worked like a charm!
Da! What are you doing, you great bloody fool!?
Shut yer trap, boy.
This'll all be over soon. All that's left now is to blow this ugly pile o' driftwood into splinters.
Why would you do such a thing!? Have you any idea how important this ship is? What it represents?
Aye, an' that's what makes it all the sweeter! Whatever it takes to knock some sense into me treacherous, backstabbin' son!
Imagine, a boy o' mine givin' up the pirate life to become a shipwright! An' buildin' a bleedin' Maelstrom vessel at that! What under Llymlaen's wide, green ocean made ye take up with these self-righteous shites!?
You're the one with no bloody sense, Da! Don't you see? The pirates had their glory days, but that era is over!
Ah! I wondered why Ahtbyrm never spoke of his father. I never would have thought...
This ship's a symbol alrightâ”€of everythin' what went wrong with the world. An' I mean to shatter it into a hunnerd thousand pieces!
Ghimthota! Forename! Pray beat the tar out of this bloated sea slug, and make sure no harm comes to the Victory!
Da, this is madness!
