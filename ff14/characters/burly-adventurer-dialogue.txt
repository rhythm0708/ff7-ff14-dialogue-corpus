My story? Well, since you asked, I wanted to retrace the historic journey of the great Ketenramm. You know─the first Eorzean to set foot on Tural, almost eighty years ago.
The Mamool Ja's leader is said to have welcomed Ketenramm with open arms, and sent him home with a bounty of silverware as a token of their friendship.
But the real treasure was the crops he brought back─popotoes, tomatoes, and corn─which spread across Eorzea like wildfire. His grand adventure led to a culinary revolution!
The tales say Ketenramm returned to Tural several times after that, but his ship vanished during his last recorded voyage, and he was never heard from again. That even a seasoned explorer like him could meet such an end is testimony to the ocean's peril...
Some parts of Tural are said to be so remote that not even Ketenramm made it to them. If I could explore those places, then perhaps I'll become even more famous than him!
