Well met, adventurer! We have the finest grog and grub this side ofâ”€ Eh? Not here to fill your belly, then?
Ahhh, a hunger for news, is it? Aye, there's been talk of a sylph lurking hereabouts, but I couldn't rightly say if it be the elder you seek.
Those woodland scamps all look alike. Short of painting one red and another one blue, most folk would struggle to tell two of 'em apart.
If you've the time, mayhap you could stay a while and see what the gods have in store. You never know, you might even stumble across this sylph elder yourself.
No word on the sylph elder yet, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time. In the meantime, how about doing a favor for old Buscarron in return?
Right, then, let's put you to work. There's a customer outside who's spoiling for a fight and I need you to cool him off for me.
No need to go cracking any skulls, though. Just take this tub of cold water and douse the drunkard. Tends to do the trick.
My patrons can swill grog all night and carouse loud enough to wake the dead if they wish, but as soon as it turns violent, I've got to put my boot down.
