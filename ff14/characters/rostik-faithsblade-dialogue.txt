Thancred! Over here!
You are returned─and none the worse for wear, to my considerable relief.
What news from our comrades?
They stand at the ready.
Excellent. Then let the fireworks begin!
Excellent. Then let the fireworks begin!
The blizzard's beginning to clear...
The vanguard should be engaging the imperials any moment now─if they haven't already.
Y'shtola and the others are with them, so I'm sure they'll be all right, but...
Wait! Something's coming!
Oi, oi! Looks like we ain't the only ones who sent out scouts!
Keep 'em away from the carriages! We lose those, and we're as good as dead!
Fighters─protect the others!
No...farther...
Glory be...
Must...bar the way...
