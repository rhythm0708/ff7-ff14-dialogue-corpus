And what brings you here, adventurer? A search for refugees? Well, then you've come to the right place!
Ah, you mean those refugees! Oh no, you won't find them here. Most of the people of Lost Hope have come to accept their situation, and are content to pass their days in peace and quiet.
Outsiders have trouble understanding thatâ”€like that merchant who passed through recently. Gregarious fellow, but awfully opinionated. Can't say I was sad to see him go.
A friend of the sultanate, are we? I take it this means someone has read my report.
The refugees who left with the merchant have yet to return, and I am increasingly concerned that Zazawaka's suspicions were correct.
...You haven't the foggiest what I'm talking about, do you? Never mind. Speak with Zazawaka. He will explain everything.
