Aye, you'll have your precious crown─once we've been duly compensated.
Do you think me a fool!? What assurance have I that you will honor your part of the agreement?
Now, now, Owyne...you're the least trustworthy man here. Not only was the crown stolen on your watch, but it looks to me as if you've violated the terms of our exchange. Did we not say that you were to come alone?
And given that you are not alone, what guarantee have we that there isn't a company of archers surrounding us even as we speak, ready to feather me and my men the moment they catch a glimpse of the crown?
You have made mock of our trust. The deal is off.
Wait! Here's your payment, as promised!
<sniff> <sniff> ...Aye, 'tis the real thing.
Ahahaha! A thousand thanks to you, boy! You've succeeded where scores of thieves have failed!
And now, at long last, we have it! The power to create an army of undying soldiers─The Traders' Spurn!
No...no, it can't be! What have I done!?
Surely you must have wondered what it was that you were handing over─what it was that seemed as valuable to us as the crown seemed to you? Or did you assume we were feeling charitable?
Ah, but you must feel terrible, knowing that you've brought us the doom of Sil'dih. Worry not, boy─we'll grant you a quick death and spare you further ignominy.
There's too many, Forename! Run! Run while you still can! I...I will do my duty.
It's your duty to serve the sultana, lad─and you'll be doing it for a good while yet!
Sultansworn! Put these thieves to the sword and secure the crown!
Sultansworn!? Hah! No matter! Kill them all!
Fight for your sultana, boy! Fight for Ul'dah!
As you command, Master Papashan!With me, Forename!
Stand your ground, Sultansworn!
