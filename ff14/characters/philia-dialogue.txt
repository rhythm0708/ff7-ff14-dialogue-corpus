Grrraaarrrgh!!!
Rest well...
Alisaie...
It was no less than what I expected, butâ€”well done.
A Lightwarden, gone. I can scarce believe it.
It's releasing its aether. Fall back!
We cannot let it touch us. Quickly, my lord, we must withdraw!
That will not be necessary, Captain.
...Though I appreciate your concern. The eternal Light of these creatures has confounded us for nigh on a hundred years. For each we have put down, another has risen up in its place, born of the selfsame aether relinquished by its predecessor.
But now we have a way to contain that corruption.
The blessing of Light! And the hero who wields it now stands before you!
Behold! The monster's power is broken! And the world twisted by its touch returns to its rightful form!
