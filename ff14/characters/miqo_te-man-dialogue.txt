I should write something too. Gods know I owe lots of people.
Greetings, friend. By your dauntless bearing, I assume you are an adventurer─and come at precisely the moment I find myself in need of an adventurer's aid. Might I beg yours?
Of all the coincidences! You will hardly believe it, but I was just this very moment reminiscing of the time you lent me your strength a twelvemonth past.
You see, I again find myself in pressing need of an adventurer's aid, just as I did last Rising. “Oh, if only Forename were here,” I thought to myself...and here you are! Well, then, what do you say? Shall we clasp arms once more?
My thanks. The matter is this: I have been approached by a lady named Ayoyo who wishes to imprint her own inimitable mark upon the skies above Limsa Lominsa─I speak, of course, of the fireworks that illumine these Rising nights.Learning of my contribution to previous years' festivities, she has enlisted me to her cause.
We already have the ear of the organizing committee. However, Lady Ayoyo has expressed a strong desire to consult with a storied adventurer before finalizing her proposal.
Come to the Yellowjackets' guardhouse at the base of the Coral Tower and I will introduce you.
Lady Ayoyo. One storied adventurer, as promised.
