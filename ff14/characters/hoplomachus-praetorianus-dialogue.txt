There they are! Stop them!
Let's keep moving.
Ugh, there is no end to them...
You won't escape, Gaius Baelsar!
You will pay for your crimes, traitor!
I was wondering when the imperial guard would appear... Focus on the magitek armor first!
Anniaâ”€on my mark!
I think not!
Damn it...
This way. Quickly!
He must... be stopped...
Damn you... Gaius...
We make ourselves easy marks by moving together. I suggest we split up.
All right, then. I'll take the low road, so to speak.
I will see you outside. Stay safe.
Well, well... Someone's been busy.
And you would bar my way, would you? ...So be it.
Come, Nidhogg! Lend me your strength!
