Mistress Forename! I knew in my heart that you were safe, but to see you again in the flesh... Words cannot well express my relief.
Even as the victory feast was taking place, the Crystal Braves turned upon us and took the Rising Stones by force.
Amid the chaos, some few of my compatriots and I were able to slip away unnoticed. Since then, we have remained in Revenant's Toll, keeping watch over the mutineers while awaiting your return.
You have done well by us, and we Domans do not soon forget our debts. We swear to do all within our power to aid you.
Shortly before you arrived, I received word from Limsa Lominsa that you were searching for General Raubahn.
As the Admiral will have informed you, he was recently moved from his cell in the Marasaja Pit.
At the same juncture, Yuyuhase and the 3rd Unit were observed leaving the Rising Stones.
This can be no simple coincidence. Their purpose, we believe, is to escort the Flame General to the scene of his execution.
Suffice it to say, we have people shadowing the 3rd. If you would join the hunt, pray seek out Doware at Highbridge, where I too am bound.
