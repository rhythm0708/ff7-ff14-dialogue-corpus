Peace, friend─we mean you no harm. You are an engineer of Garlond Ironworks, are you not? We were alerted to your plight, and have come to rescue you.
And you are Forename Surname, I presume. I was told to expect an “honorary” Serpent. My thanks for your aid, friend.
I've never seen a craft of this design... It must be Garlond's work. Is there no end to the man's treachery?
The secrets of magitek belong in imperial hands. They are not to be squandered on Eorzean savages!
We are taking this craft back to the fortress! Dismantle it if you must! And bring the engineer! Someone must pay for Garlond's crimes.
Imperial scouts from Castrum Oriens. They mean to requisition the ship.
Wedge! You have to help him! That fool of a Lalafell was hiding inside the Tiny Bronco!
The Tiny Bronco? But isn't that the Ironworks' latest creation!?
It's the first airship we've built since the Calamity─the first since Master Garlond...well, since he went missing.
After years of work, she was finally ready for her first test flight. And she was soaring, she really was─till those bastards blasted her out of the sky!
Attend me, all: the Ironworks' latest creation must not fall into Garlean hands. We shall strike them, swift and sure, and rescue Engineer Wedge.
Forename, I trust we can rely on your support.
May the Matron watch over us! With me!
An ambush! To arms!
