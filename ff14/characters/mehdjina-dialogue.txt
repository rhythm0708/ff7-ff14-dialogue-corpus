Well, I can. Nowhere's safe! Run all you like, but there's no escaping these things!
And even if I could...it's too late for my family!
This isn't good. The more they dwell on the tragedy, the more likely we are to lose them, too...
My friends! This...this is a place of worship!
Should your heart quake with sadness, cast your mind to the heavens and remember.
Remember the teachings of the old gods. Did they not implore us to stand fast when waves of sorrow break against our shores?
Know this, my children. There is more ugliness than beauty in this world.
To live is to suffer. To drink of calamity and drown in anguish. To toil and be tested, always and ever.
