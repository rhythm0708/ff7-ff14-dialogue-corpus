Dear adventurer,I am a theater set designer, and one who is said to have a penchant for designing unusual props for the stage.
Some of my labors of love, it thrilled me to discover, have caught your eye to become little companions that follow you around, or even modes of transportation.
To see my creations for the stage delight you off it─even the oddest ones─delights me in turn, and further motivates me in my craft.
In hopes that I can continue to delight you all, I will endeavor to create ever more interesting props!Yours in whimsy,A Theater Set Designer
