The Overmind must by now be aware of our intrusion. Let us press on into the hive, and ensure that we have our hosts' undivided attention.
That should be sufficient. If we did not have our hosts' full attention before, we must surely have it now...
Our audience with the primal may be granted soon after our capture. Pray advise me once you have steeled your mind for the battle to come.
You are prepared, then?
Hold here, Forename. When next the Gnath come, we offer no resistance.
