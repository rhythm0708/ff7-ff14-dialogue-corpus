We're under attack, sir! Magitek armor─no visible designation.
Magitek!? But who─?
Aaah!
All cannons, return fire! Damage report!
The main reactor's been hit! Helm unresponsive! We're going down, sir!
Damn it! They knew exactly where to hit us.All hands─brace for impact!
Glad to have you back, Master Alphinaud. We have landed in one piece─more or less.
But the air filtration system is damaged, and the ship is filling with smoke. We must gather the survivors and get out while we still can.
Aye... Aye.
