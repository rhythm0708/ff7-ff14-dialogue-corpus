Forename! What are you doing out here?
No, I don't mind if you help with the boxes, but it's far from the most exciting of tasks. Are you sure?
Well, I appreciate the assistance.
We need to get these to Aporia. Time is short, of course─but they're full of organic specimens and samples, so try not to be too rough with them.
Alphinaud should be waiting for us when we arrive. I'll see you there!
I can't shake the feeling that there are more of these than when I started. Did I pick up an additional crate somewhere...?
Fancy seeing you here! To what do I owe the pleasure?
Fancy seeing you here! To what do I owe the pleasure?
Oh, you're helping with the crates! Wonderful─you can put that there, with the others...
You have my gratitude, but how did you come to be involved in this?
Hah, then I suppose I have Thancred to thank as well.
If you're wondering why we were tasked with bringing these boxes to Aporia to begin with─so was I.
It turns out that this is a base of operations, of sorts. Those with final say as to what is included in the ship's manifest can be found here.
Father included, I suspect...
That should be everything!
You carried all of that at once!? Are you trying to injure yourself?
Oh, hush. They're lighter than they look─and not everyone has your delicate arms.
I suppose we should let someone know that we've finished...
Theopauldin is in the courtyard. We can report to him.
Why don't you come along? You should get credit for your assistance, at least. Considering where we are, we might even learn something interesting!
This must be Theopauldin.
I keep thinking that I've seen him elsewhere, but I cannot for the life of me remember when.
