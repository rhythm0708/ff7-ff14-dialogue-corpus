A pleasure to meet you, miss. Truly. It seems like only yesterday I watched as you took flight astride an amaro to go and save the Oracle.
Strange to think the Eulmoran soldiers we once locked blades with are now on our side, but we will do our utmost to keep the peace here in Lakeland.
We seem to be missing oneâ”€
My apologies, Captain Lyna. An elderly gentleman asked that I escort him to Clearmelt. It...took longer than I anticipated.
I'll not begrudge your desire to help those in need, but a soldier must be punctual. Especially when we play host to honored guests.
It won't happen again.
The name's Theyler. I'm sure you don't remember, but we met once before in the infirmary.
I asked you to deliver a message to the Exarch and the Warrior of Darkness. Little did I know I was already talking to her.
Don't give up. Don't give in. I keep those words close to my heart. And the boundless, beautiful skies above serve as a reminder of their importance.
My friend got to see the night's return shortly before he passed. He left this world with a smile, satisfied with a glimpse of what was to come.
But there are countless others who weren't so fortunate.
They gave their lives for the promise of a future they'll never know. And so it falls to us to do everything we can to fulfill that promise.
No matter what happens, we won't give up. We won't give in!
Your heroism has inspired all of our guardsmen in much the same manner.
Our scouts at the Northern Staging Point have not had the pleasure of meeting you in person.
Let us not keep them waiting.
Did you slay this eater? Your orders were to await the main force before engaging.
No, Captain! It wasn't us, I swear it! A man came out of nowhere and cut it down before we knew what was happening.
By himself? Certainly it is no Lightwarden, but nevertheless...
