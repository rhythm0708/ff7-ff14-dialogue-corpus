Our nation is soon to hold a rite of succession to choose its next Dawnservant.
We will not abide interference from foreign agents seeking to foment trouble. What brings you to Tuliyollal?
I can answer that. These fine people are allies in my succession bid.
Th-Third Promise! If you vouch for them, then all is well, of course!
Please accept our apologies!
No need to bow and scrape! That our soldiers are so diligent in their duties fills me with pride.
We'll be continuing our patrol, then!
Well, well. You really are a figure of authority here.
Are you suggesting I don't look the part!?
Anyway, first things first...
I bid you welcome to Tuliyollal!
Ahhh, it's so nice to feel that familiar breeze again... I wasn't sure my stomach would make it.
I wonder what kind of trouble those soldiers are expecting?
What an amazing cityâ”€as lively as Ul'dah, and even more colorful...
According to Erenville, the Vanu I thought I saw belongs to a clan known as the Hanuhanu. It seems they share more than a physical resemblance.
Well, despite the storm's efforts to the contrary, here we are. Safe and sound.
I would ask if the journey tired you, but...I'm sure you've endured far worse.
Right, then! First things first...
I...ugh. Still a bit queasy... No more boats for a while...
I realize we've just arrived, but we should get you familiar with the city before the rite of succession begins.
No arguments here. I should very much like to explore.
Then I'll...guide you...
Are you sure you're in any condition to do so...?
