Welcome to the For'ard Cabins!
Oh, such lovely little cottages, and they're on the water!
What a comfort to have our lodgings sorted in advance.
Wuk Lamat said she would “bring the information” to us. I wonder what she meant by that...
That's right, the reservation is under Wuk Lamat's name. If you don't mind, I'll leave my companions to you.
Certainly, sir.
I'll go and track down the Third Promise. Once you've finished organizing your gear, you can meet us outside Xbalyav Ty'e.
Greetings, visitors to Tuliyollal, and welcome to the For'ard Cabins!
Whenever you are ready, I will show you to your rooms.
Trust you to be the keenest to head out, Forename.
But where are Erenville and Wuk Lamat, I wonder...
Oh good, you're all here.
Who might your companions be?
Seeing as we needed information, I thought who better to get it from than the locals? These two hail from the villages we're thinking to visit.
I give you credit for taking initiative, at least.
What do you mean, “at least”!?
