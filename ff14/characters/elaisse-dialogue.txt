Well you're clearly not locals or traveling peddlers, which makes you all...?
Ahhh, wards of House Fortemps! How very interesting.
Count Edmont has granted us leave to remain in Ishgard for as long as we wish─which may be some time.
Accordingly, we will have need of sundry goods, hence our desire to make your acquaintance. That is, of course, assuming you are content to accept the custom of foreigners. Should you be uncomfortable─
Young sir, we do not discriminate in matters of money. If you have coin to spend, who are we to refuse it?
Weapons, armor, accoutrements, medicine, materials─whatever your desire, it can be found in the Crozier. Our merchants will be more than happy to accommodate you, as you shall soon see.
Our next destination is the aetheryte plaza in Foundation. If everyone is ready...
And here we have Foundation's aetheryte plaza. If you have yet to attune to the aetheryte, it would be wise to do so now.
As for our next destination...
Mayhap we should decide together. What else can be found nearby?
The Skysteel Manufactory stands to the west. There our engineers conceive and manufacture weapons for use against the dragons. The Holy Stables, where chocobos are trained for war, also lie in that direction.
To the north and east can be found the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly, while to the south and east...well... 'Twould be best if you avoided that area.
And why is that?
I...I fear our knights may not be able to ensure your safety in the lowest levels, Master Alphinaud...
