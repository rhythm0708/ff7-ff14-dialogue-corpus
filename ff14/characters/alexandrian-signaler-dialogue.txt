Report from the fleet. The enemy has offered unexpected resistance. We've been forced to withdraw.
Useless. All of you.
Stop!
Y-Your Majesty...?
Enough of this! Enough!
You swore you wouldn't harm my people!
Out of my way!
Have you gone mad!?
When the army fails in its duty, it is the charge of the King of Resolve to clean up its mess.
To achieve victory by any means necessary.
Zoraal Ja to Everkeep. Initiate Code Blood.
Execute all civilians and commandeer their souls!
Damn you.
Stop!
Please, Father! Stop!
Gulool Ja! I told you not to come!
“Gulool Ja”?
You must flee, Gulool Ja! It isn't safe!
I'm not going anywhere! I have to stop my father!
I am not your father!
Let him go!
Using a child as a shield!? Have you no shame!?
Release him at once, or you shall answer to me!
Pitiful relic. Kneel before your king!
Otis? What's wrong?
Find me at the top of Everkeep.
There we will determine who is fit to rule.
I must protect them...
That he should take his own child hostage...
We must hurry back to Everkeep!
Zoraal Ja thinks nothing of others' lives. He will kill his own people!
Chances are we'll have to face a good part of his army, with Otis among them...
Let's take all care!
Come, let's protect the people!
Are you ready, Forename?
Owww...
I have no more use for you. Begone.
Father, wait! Father!
Otis... Lamaty'i... You have to stop him... You have to...
What have you done?
Sphene! Can't you order them to stand down!?
The King of Resolve holds military authority. I cannot overrule his commands.
If there's something you can do, then do it!
Your crimes are beyond forgiveness, but your people are innocent.
I deceived you all, and still...
The talk can wait. When you said that you wanted to protect your people, I trust you weren't lying?
Of course not! There's nothing I wouldn't do for them!
Then let's split up and get to work!
Do what you can do...
Please, everyone, lend me your strength.
The citizens... This is horrible...
The way's blocked!
I have authority enough to move structures. A moment!
It's gone!?
We're good to go!
There... Now, please help as many as you can!
Let's keep moving!
Right, let's deal with these ones first!
We'll clean them all out!
This is awful...
How terrified you must have been...
I'm truly in your debt...
There are still those we can save! We keep moving!
I will make us a path. O Everkeep, hearken to me!
This saves us a detour.
Excellent! Let's press on!
So many still crying out in fear and in pain... Please hold on!
