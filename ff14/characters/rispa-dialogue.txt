Khrrr...khrrrrrr... Ah, how long has it been since last I felt man's touch? I cannot help but be reminded of my master's hand...
He was a knight of Voeburt. A noble and valiant soul.
But like so many others, he died fighting the sin eaters. Though he is long departed, I remain in this land out of respect for his memory.
