Hush now, my dearest, close your weary eyes.♪Bask in the warmth of my tender lullaby.♪
No, fiend! You're the one who will be sleeping!
You call that a song!? Don't make me laugh!
Why deny your feelings, why keep your love from me?♪Give your heart to my song, and it shall set you free.♪
Be careful, Forename!
I've got a bad feeling about this!
My love unrequited, I hunger for your kiss,♪I taste only tears, will I ne'er know true bliss?♪
Keep your guard up!
Lost to your affection, I languish in the night.♪My salvation lies in your love's precious light.♪
