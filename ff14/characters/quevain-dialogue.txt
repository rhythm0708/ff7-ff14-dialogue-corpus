That eclectic attire, that distinct scent of the unknown... You, my good stranger, must be an adventurer! You have found yourself in the company of Quevain, journalist for The Thavnairian Truth. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Are you aware of the festivities currently underway at the Gold Saucer? They guarantee a generous MGP bonus to those who participate, but I have reason to believe that there is more to this celebration than meets the eye...
As a writer for the premier publication on unexplained and otherworldly phenomena, I was drawn not to the promise of copious Cactpots, but to the rumors of enigmatic water imps that have suddenly proliferated amongst the Saucer's patrons.
We at The Thavnairian Truth have been looking to expand our investigations across the star, and this supernatural scoop presents us with the ideal opportunity.
Why have the imps made themselves known now? What do they intend to accomplish? I must cover this groundbreaking story with all due haste...but I cannot hope to answer all these questions alone. Tell me, adventurer, would you aid me in my pursuit of truth?
Excellent, excellent! Then let us reconvene at the Gold Saucer's Entrance Square.
...Ah, but if you require a ticket to enter, I'm afraid I have naught to spare. Perhaps you might have better luck speaking with the well-heeled youth over yonder? He was loudly proclaiming something about a “not-so-small fortune” from the Saucer nary a moment ago.
Ah, you've arrived. Notice anything...out of the ordinary?
