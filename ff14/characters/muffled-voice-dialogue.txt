Oddest little squeal, don't you think? Anyway, I suppose we'll have to take care of it until the Archeion is open again.
At first we thought it might have escaped from one of the research laboratories, but when we reported our find to the Studium, they were just as dumbfounded as we were...
If it truly is a newly discovered species, we could have our names appear in a gazette!
