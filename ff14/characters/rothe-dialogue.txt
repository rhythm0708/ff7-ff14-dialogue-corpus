Hm? Yes, I'm Rothe, and who might you be...?
Ah, the promised help! Glad to have you aboard!
I've the honor of overseein' this fine mess you see before you. Sent me over on one of them black birds, same as you, to build and mend and tell others how to build and mend. But Fury take me, this ice! It's bloody unnatural how fast it forms!
It's icicle sprites, I tell you. Mark my words, there're pockets of 'em here and there, just waitin' for me to turn my back so they can sneak out and do their dirty work! So I need you to search the hamlet and put an end to it. If you stand watch long enough, you're sure to find 'em.
Hah! Now there's a woman what looks like she's found her marks!
You're just the sort we need around here─the kind that'll hop to when she sees a task undone!
You're a dab hand at warcraft, I can tell. Not that I've any skill at arms to speak of, mind, but it doesn't take an expert to recognize expertise.
Be a waste to keep you to myself when there're others out what need help same as me, so if you're keen to keep on doin' what you've done, I'd ask you to head north to the Pike─the bloody huge statue out in the wastes, if you've never been.
Mason by the name of Thierremont is out there tendin' to the thing. Good man, Thierremont, but I reckon he's taken on too much work for one. Might be there's somethin' you can do for him.
