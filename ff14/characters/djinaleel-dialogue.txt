What am I doing? Oh, recording my sales. Still do it daily out of habit, though I don't know why I bother. Hardly sell anything these days.
Business has never been this terrible...but I suppose things could be even worse. I could have a consortium to keep afloat, like Khalzahl.
I don't envy his position. Better to be alone with my little operation, I've come to realize.
You're a traveler, by the looks of you? If you have a moment, perhaps you could pay Khalzahl a visit. He'd be glad for tidings from abroad.
Like as not, you'll find him at the Saltwind's Sails, the harbor guild building across the water from here.
If times are tough for me, they must be a thousand times worse for Khalzahl. I can't help but worry for him.
