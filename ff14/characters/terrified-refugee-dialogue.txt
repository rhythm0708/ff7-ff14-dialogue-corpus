Wh-What are you doing? Don't...don't draw. Don't draw, don't draw, don't draw─ DON'T DRAW!
...Why didn't you run away with me? We could've escaped together. Then you'd be here, with me─be here to soothe me. Why...why did you have to stay and leave me alone?
Wh-Who are you? What do you want!?
Aye, it's true. I followed the merchant, and may the gods strike me down for my folly.
“What they will not give, you must take,” he said. When we asked how, he revealed a cache of weapons he had brought and implored us to “seize control of our fates.” I thought about running then and there, but the others were so excited... He split us into two groups, sent us off on our own─
B-But when the Flames found us, we didn't know what to do! Our leader tried to parley with theirs, but then they started arguing, and then fighting, and then everyone was fighting, and the Flames were shouting to give no quarter, and─
Oh gods, the other group! They're still out there! If we don't stop them, they'll be massacred like mine was!
The other refugees are hiding in the caves south of Lost Hope, but to approach them would be fruitless. They would sooner call us agents of the sultanate and try to kill us than listen to reason. Why, the twins might even deign to do the deed themselves.
A pox on all bloody sellswords! They were supposed to train us to fight, but the ones he sent with us vanished during the struggle.
Oh, if only we had never listened to that merchant's ridiculous claims! He said our cause was righteous, that the gods would never suffer us to be defeated─
Though, if they were forced to confront reality... That's it! Challenge the twins to combat and show my brethren that their strongest warriors are no match for one woman! Mayhap then they will agree to lay down their arms and renounce this plot!
