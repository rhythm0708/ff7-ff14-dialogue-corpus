Lali-ho, stranger!
So there I am─minding my own business, quaffing my ale─when I hear a ruckus outside. And then, clear as day: “Warrior of Light”!
That sounded like trouble to me, and I knew that if anyone was going to trouble herself over that trouble, it'd be you. So I gave Glynard the ol' “But I'm your best customer!” routine until he agreed to bring me here, and now I know where you live! Great, ain't it?
Some bastard's walking around wearing Ardbert─Lamitt's Ardbert─like a secondhand jerkin!?
I don't know what's more offensive─that, or that you let him leave without a proper dwarven decking!
Bah! In a pinch, an improvised decking would've been fine!
Tell you what. I'll show you how to knock that bastard flat in the blink of an eye here and now. Taboos be damned.
After all, we ain't about to let him keep on like that, are we? Pretending to be Ardbert. Lamitt's Ardbert.
Step one: make a fist. Step two: extend your arm, like so. Step three: beat 'em senseless. Got it?
Good. Now make me proud!
