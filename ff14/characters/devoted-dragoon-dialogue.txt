Down with you!
I shall make it quick!
Leave the skies to us!
Have the rear guard ready the cannons!
Have the rear guard ready the cannons!
It readies to strike!
Do not lose heart!
We too can ride the wind!
'Tis like unto an inferno.
There'd be no walking away from a blast like that.
There'd be no walking away from a blast like that.
There'd be no walking away from a blast like that.
There'd be no walking away from a blast like that.
Focus your attacks on the armored dragon!
They'll need more than thick hides to prevail over us.
Urgh!
Argh!
Such terrible strength...
Such terrible strength...
What in the...?
Everyone, fall back! Fall back now!
On your feet!
Fall back!
