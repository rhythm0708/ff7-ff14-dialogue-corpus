Halt! Madam, I'm going to have to ask you to put the pretzel on the ground and place your hands above your head!
State your name and business! A twilight pretzel from Papashan? By the gods, forgive me! You could say this new post has my nerves in a...twist.
I'm...I'm terribly sorry for that. Ahem, yes, well, you may rest assured that the Dispatch Yard is safe so long as I stand watch.
Please give Papashan my thanks, and tell him that I only wish I could repay the favor...
