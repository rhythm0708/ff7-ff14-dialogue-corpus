Hear... Feel... Think...
Through time and space hast thou journeyed unto me...as I knew thou wouldst.
We are the Word of the Mother. We who were once called “Minfilia.”
Much time hath passed for thee, since the bloody banquet. Since...since I hearkened to Her word.
Mother... Hydaelyn guided me...towards Y'shtola and Thancred, that I might be swept up in their Flow...and delivered unto the aetherial sea...
There, adrift and alone, Her voice silent once more, I prayed... For those we have lost. For those we can yet save. To Her I would make an offering...
We speak now with one Voice. One Will. One Word. Unto thee we bequeath the most precious of gifts: the truth which lieth at the heart of this world.
Thus do we beseech thee once more... Hear... Feel... Think...
Before there was life, in the depths of the aetherial sea, Light and Dark did once dwell as one.
But the Darkness coveted power, and the balance was broken. Thus was I forced to banish Him unto the distant heavens, to forever remain apart. A moon bound.
In sundering the star did we cry out, and the barriers 'twixt planes chance to falter.
Across ten and three were we then divided. Reflections of the Source, each possessed of a shard.
Zodiark longeth to be made whole. For His restoration, for His resurrection, His servants labor without cease.
They seek to tear down the barriers which surround the Source.
Thus do they rejoice in their Ardor─in your calamities─for each marks a Rejoining.
Seven times have they succeeded. Seven times hath the Darkness grown stronger. Seven times have I failed.
The Ascians cannot be suffered to continue. This...this is my final...
The Crystal's power is all but spent. With what remains, I will return you to the shore of the aetherial sea.
Blessed children, go forth and seek...seek...
You've had another vision, haven't you?
Let us return to Master Matoya's cave. Everyone will wish to hear what you saw.
Still in one piece, are we?
Well? Did you learn anything?
The Word of the Mother...? I am not sure I understand.
Nor am I. Krile?
As unbelievable as it sounds, I see no reason to doubt her─the Word's tale. No one was more sensitive to the will of Hydaelyn than Minfilia.
And if Hydaelyn has grown so weak that She can barely make Herself heard, it is not hard to see why Minfilia, having joined with Her, might struggle to maintain her own form.
What? Why would she need to “maintain her own form”? Are you saying─ Are you saying she's gone?
But that cannot be! Not now, not after all we have accomplished! We were meant to usher in the dawn's light together!
She threw herself on the fire to fuel your “dawn's light,” boy. You'll just have to usher it in on your own.
Must you be so ungentle!?
Tell me about the Scions, boy.
The...the Scions of the Seventh Dawn labor for Eorzea's salvation.
Whenever the realm is threatened, be it by primal, Ascian, Garlean or any other, we take up arms in her defense, that all in Eorzea may live to see a brighter tomorrow.
And that's very noble of you. But in chasing after these lofty goals of yours, you seem to have lost sight of some basic truths.
To win a war, you must be willing to do whatever it takes. To fight, to kill, and, if necessary, to die.
The path you've chosen is paved with the dead. Walk it with your eyes open, or not at all.
I know the truth of which you speak, and have from the first.
If the Ascians will go to any lengths to resurrect their god, then we must needs be as committed to our cause─to unmask them and their schemes, and to crush them both utterly.
Come. There is much to be done.
Y-Yes, of course.
Thancred, wait!
No... No, this is all wrong.
She...she's not coming back, is she.
I know that, I do. To give all for her beliefs was ever her way.
So will we, as we must. What greater calling could there be than to stand against the Dark as defenders of the Light? And yet...where does it end? The sacrifice, the loss...
...We carry on, as we must. She went to great lengths to inform us of the enemy's designs. We stand, as ever, against the Dark, as defenders of the Light.
Yet for how long, I wonder. How much more loss must we endure...?
It weighs on you too, I know. I understand why she made her decision, and yet...
Every time we lose another friend, I have to ask myself if there was not another way...
I must ask that you not breathe a word of this to any of the others at the Rising Stones─especially F'lhaminn.
I will brief Tataru on what we have learned, as well as Urianger. He may have insight into what the Word told us.
As for you, Forename...after all you have done, I would say you have earned a rest.
Ah, but speaking of well-earned rewards─I received a missive from Ser Aymeric while you were away. 'Twould seem he is planning a ceremony of some sort, and would like you to attend.
He did not divulge the details, preferring instead to explain in person. Mayhap you should pay him a visit?
Ah, Mistress Surname. The lord commander left instructions that you were to be shown inside.
A pleasure to see you again, my friend. I take it you received our invitation?
Good, good... You of all people should be present.
When the True Brothers of the Faith seized control of the Vault, I feared the worst.
Yet in adversity were we blessed with the promise of peace between man and dragon, through Vidofnir's timely rescue of an innocent child. Timely, I say, though “miraculous” or “providential” might better describe the event. The gods themselves could not have devised a more fitting symbol of hope.
Needless to say, we could scarce let such an opportunity pass us by, which is why I set about making formal arrangements for a peace conference between our peoples.
You and yours have done more to bring us together than any, and it is only right that you attend.
But, I confess, that is not the only reason I would be glad to have you there. Given Nidhogg's implacable opposition to the peace, it is possible that he and his followers may attempt to disrupt proceedings, in which event, your presence would be a comfort to all in attendance.
Pray understand, I have no wish to invite the wyrm's ire, but if our fractured nation is to heal─if we are to move forward as a people united─then we must do whatever is necessary to bring about lasting change.
'Tis nothing, 'tis nothing. <sigh> Lucia cautioned me against giving vent to my passions, lest my wounds reopen.
It has not been easy reaching out to our opponents in Ishgard, many of whom sympathized with the actions of the “True Brothers.” But in so doing, we have limited the influence of the zealots.
The people are ready, my friend. This conference must go ahead!
I knew you would understand.
The conference will take place on the border of Ishgardian and Dravanian territory, in Falcon's Nest.
Lucia is there seeing to the final preparations even as we speak. Pray join her at your earliest convenience─'twould not do for the guest of honor to arrive late, after all.
Oh, and one more thing!
A drink! We should make time for one. Once the conference is concluded, I mean. By my reckoning, 'tis long overdue.
The lord commander said you would come, Forename.
As you can see, preparations for the conference are proceeding apace.
Mark well the curtain above.
It conceals a relief that will be unveiled during the conference. The masons labor day and night to see it finished on schedule.
Ser Aymeric wanted a symbol which would endure long after this conference is concluded. I think he will be pleased with the result.
'Twas not my war, but I made it mine...and to see it draw closer to a resolution fills me with a strange hope.
His faith is infectious, is it not? His certainty that we can be better than we are...
Forgive me, I am rambling. You must be tired from your journey. Go, rest. I will not keep you.
If you would rather not take a rest, then why not take a walk around Falcon's Nest? Make your presence known to the people and so forth.
In addition to those who have come from far and wide to attend this ceremony, you may meet lords Artoirel and Emmanellain, who have graciously volunteered their services.
They should be glad to see you. Now, if you would excuse me, I must needs return to my duties.
I am glad to see that the rumors were true! Well met, Mistress Surname, and fear not─I've no intention of begging your aid with this or that. Everything appears to be in order.
My only lingering concern is that one of the Convictors might not have been informed of our plans. As I recall, Vidofnir may pass directly over their encampment.
The last thing we need is a glory-seeking nobleman attempting to slay a Dravanian ambassador to a peace conference...
