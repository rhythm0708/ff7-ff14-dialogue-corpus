When you face the Lord of Crags, think not of Limsa Lominsa, Eorzea, or anything beyond his chamber. Think only of the men and women by your side.
Fight for them, and they will fight for you. Remember that no great victory was ever achieved alone.
Pshhh... Shkohhh...Goodly uplander must be facing mighty rockman with clever fighty-think. Gobbieflock cannot be coming to rescue this time!
Ah, Forename, you brave fool! Promise me that when you meet Titan, you'll look him in the eye and tell him Landenel sends his regards!
You are a veteran of countless battles, Forename. This is but one more. Trrrust in your experience, and you will prevail.
You are blessed with a fortitude to rival the earth itself. Titan will struggle to break you, I think.
...You are kind to indulge them, Forename. This banquet is as much for the Company as it is for you, whatever they may claim.
I do not deny that they mean well, but now is scarcely the time for celebration. Though they have all but pronounced you the victor, the battle with Titan has yet to begin. The hour has come for the good captain to make good on his promise. We must speak with him again.
You must be eager to face Titan. As promised, we will show you the way.
Travel to Bronze Lake in upper La Noscea. There you will meet with Riol, another man who once served with the Company.
To ensure that this knowledge does not fall into the wrong hands, he will remain in hiding until you have given the correct signal.
Give me your map. You must whistle loudly at the three locations I mark. Only then will he appear to meet you at this fourth location. I realize this may seem excessive now, but you will see that it is more than reasonable once you comprehend the risks inherent in our method.
