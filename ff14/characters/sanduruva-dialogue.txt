The tower must be protected...
We will not let it fall!
You will not steal away our prosperity!
We hear it! We heed it! The call to defend the tower!
Wonderful.I do so love guessing games.
Whatâ”€!?Ugh, spare me...
Illusory magicks?
If I alone cannot expel you...
Just a pale imitation of divinity, in the end.
The corruption...it feels stronger here.
Ugh, we're so close, and now this!
Stay focused! Now is not the time for mistakes!
