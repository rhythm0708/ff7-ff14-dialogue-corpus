Yes? Can I help you?
We wish to speak with Chief Hermes. Do you know where we might find him?
Well, now... By your mask, I assume you are one of the Fourteen. I wasn't aware there was to be a visitation...
Between you and us, it's something of a surprise. Your discretion in the matter would be appreciated.
I see, I see. My lips are sealed!
The chief should be out conducting observations as usual. His focus of late has been aquatic creatures, so I expect you will find him at one of the pools here.
The pools, you say? Many thanks, and apologies for disrupting your work.
I say, Hythlodaeus... While I've never met Hermes, you know him well, do you not?
That being the case, couldn't you simply find him by his aether?
Aye, that I could...
As you know, Emet-Selch and I can discern the color of souls.
By the same token, we can also see aether quite keenly, and from great distances.
With this skill, I could readily locate Hermes, but I felt that it would be a waste of an opportunity.
We're here to perform an assessment, after all. By searching the ordinary way, we stand to gain insight into Elpis and the man in charge of it.
This is as much for your own enjoyment, like as not. But point taken.
If you're going to accompany us, make yourself useful and help us look for Hermes.
According to his profile, he has short, dark hair.
So you know, it's because we're in Elpis that we don't have our cowls up. A special exemption due to the need to be aware of dangerous creatures.
Elsewhere, we do not exhibit our individuality. It's unseemly. This is all common sense, but I would not assume you possess any.
Heh heh! It's a rare treat indeed to be able to search for someone by their appearance, and I thank you for humoring me.
Come, let's find our man!
Still looking for the chief? He should be out observing somewhere, likely at one of the pools.
Heh heh! They have such funny faces!
