Hmm... It's a bit too flavorful for my liking...
Perhaps compared to what you're used to.
It's the little things that make life worth living, don't you think?
I know this is not a dream, and yet...
I felt the same way at the Dragonsong War's end. Every morning I would step outside and need to be reminded that it wasn't my imagination. That my world had been forever changed.
And just as I had grown accustomed to the idea, again you change my world in ways I never thought possible.
Were it not for you and your fellow Scions, the rifts between man and dragon and myriad tribes might never have been bridged.
The Grand Company of Eorzea, the Ilsabard contingent... We owe it all to you.
We've shed many tears in recent days. Of pain and sorrow. Triumph and joy. I much prefer the latter.
I am honored to fight by your side. As an Eorzean and Garlean both, I shall do all in my power to bring my peoples together.
Indeed. We can but do our utmost to unite these disparate peoples and lead them to victory.
It is a remarkable achievementâ”€everything that I and the Populares had hoped for and more.
Would that it had come sooner.
Indeed. Too many are not here to see it. And yet...there is a warmth in my breast. As if they still share in this moment.
Yes. I know what you mean.
On a night like tonight, the wind and cold seem to pass me by.
