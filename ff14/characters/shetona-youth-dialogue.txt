Zoraal Ja!?
It's true! I saw him!
We believe he staged the attack from Yyasulani, which has been encased within a mysterious dome. I know that you're concerned for your loved ones there as well.
But mark my words: I won't let Zoraal Ja torment us any further. Our father gave his life to protect our nation, and I'm prepared to do the same.
You say that, but those metal monstrosities are still up there in the sky! What are you going to do about them!?
The enemy is still on our doorstep, and waiting for them to strike again accomplishes nothing.
That's why we're going to strike first. We're going to take the battle straight to Zoraal Ja and put an end to it all.
And while my sister sallies forth, I will take charge of the city's defenses. Not another soul will come to harm, we swear to you.
Like our father before us, we will lead with resolve and reason to restore peace to our nation. So please, have patience and faith.
Gehehehe!
So the resolve goes on the attack while reason shores up the defenses... Sounds like a fine plan.
Needless to say you can count on my sword. Tural's my home, and I'll do my part for it!
Hear, hear, Brother!
That makes two of us! Er, or was that two of we? Bah, never mind that.
What of the rest of you? Will you let others do the work? Or will you do your part and fight!?
We fight, we fight! We're Tuliyollans because we're united! We'll stand with you and weather this storm!
He's right. This is our nation and it falls to us to protect it.
