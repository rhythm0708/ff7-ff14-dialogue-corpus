Help! Someone, anyone─we need help!
I don't like the sound of that one bit. Come on.
Wercrata, he...<pant> <pant>...the tributum and...and the bloody ratmen, they... <pant> <pant> Damn it all!
You there─take a deep breath, and then tell us what happened.
It was all business as usual... The tributum's due soon, and we were taking it to the imperials when the Qiqirn attacked! They took my brother, and our money!
Took him where?
Ruins to the south of here. Was just an old temple before they came and... Listen, Wercrata's the only family I've got left! If I lose him, I─
The Ziggurat? If the ratmen took him there, he's as good as dead...
We've got to get after them! If there's even a chance her brother is still alive, we have to try!
You're right, Lyse. We've got to help them, if not for the missing man then for the tributum. The Garleans won't suffer excuses if they're late...
So Wercrata's being held somewhere at the Ziggurat to the south, which has been taken over by a host of Qiqirn bandits. That about covers it, then.
Be prepared for a fight. They may not be the most challenging foes, but there's sure to be a lot of them.
