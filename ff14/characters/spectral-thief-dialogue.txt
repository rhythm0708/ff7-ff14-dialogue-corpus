Like a gust of wind, I shall sweep away the pall of Darkness!
My swiftness knows no equal!
Fast as the Light that banishes the Dark!
Hmph, when will you learn to call your lovely branch when you're in trouble? We'll discuss this later, but for now...onward!
Our thanks, Feo Ul!
Oho, we meet again, and during such a festive occasion besides! Let us revel, my friends!
The Fuath! For once I'm glad to see them!
Come, come! Gather ye around, and lend an ear to my sweet melody!
This way, my brave sapling! This way!
