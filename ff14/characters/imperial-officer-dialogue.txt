Rhitahtyn...
Where were his men when he faced the enemy!? Fleeing, even as their commander yielded up his last breath!? If it should prove they questioned his right...
I-I cannot speak for them, my lord.
...Beg pardons, my lord, but there is more. The Maelstrom has laid siege to Castrum Occidens.

Go forth and show them the futility of their resistance!
