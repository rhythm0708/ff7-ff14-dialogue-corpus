Travelers, are you? You may wish to postpone your plans. The Garleans have launched an attack on the Confederacy.
We have no reason to believe they'll turn their attention here, but for your own safety I suggest you return to Kugane.
The Garleans bear no love for the Confederacy, but with Doma lost to them, why would they attack? Unless...
Unless Yotsuyu is on that island.
Even if she isn't, our allies are under attack, and they need our help.
We will help them, while you remain with Soroban. Arguing will only delay us. Is that clear?
Fine. But you haven't heard the last of this.
Sorobanâ”€we may need to make a swift exit. See that the boat is ready to sail at a moment's notice.
It shall be done!
What, and you're going to swim there, are you?
'Tis the quickest way. And you may rest assured I've been practicing!
Yyyaaarrgghhh!!!!!
Come!
<sputter> Haha! <cough> <cough> I did it! <gasp>
No time to rest, Master Alphinaud! Our allies are sorely pressed!
