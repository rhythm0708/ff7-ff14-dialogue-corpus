Oh, we have guests.
You must excuse the poor welcome. Long days and longer nights have taken their toll, as you can see...
I am Varshahn. Servant to the satrap. My task was, in fact, to wake these good men and women. If you will allow.
People of the Great Work! I come bearing new scales!
Mmm... Scales...?
We have new scales!?
Yes, my friends. Gather round. I have them right here.
