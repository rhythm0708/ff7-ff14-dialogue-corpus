Very good, very good! Though friend or no, all are welcome in Mord Souq.
"Souq“ is Mordish for ”city.“ As things stand, this souq boasts the largest and busiest marketplace in all Amh Araeng.
You'll find ore from the mines here, of course, but all manner of other things too─many of them rare.
As I told you before, not many visit Amh Araeng by choice, but Mord Souq's a different story. Merchants come from malms around to purchase the relics the Mord dig up.
Aye, that they do, for Mord do not dismiss the spoils of the earth. We clean them and polish them and reveal to the world their true value!
That is why they come here! Come from far away! Come with much money!
And so our souq is always busy, busy, busy! No such thing as a thing no one needs!
You say that every time, Master Ghen Gen! Some sort of family motto, wasn't it?
Or perhaps a Mord philosophy─for which we should all be very grateful. Would that everyone was so willing to take in refugees regardless of race or creed.
Now, then─if you intend to spend any time here, you'll want to gain the trust of the locals.
And there's a little custom all newcomers are expected to observe...
The cracking of the coinpurse! You buy one thing from the market. Price can be low or high, just as long as you buy!
...As the good Mord says. In fact, the Exarch sent a little something to cover this very expense.
A Voeburt gold piece, no less! The first I've held in years.
