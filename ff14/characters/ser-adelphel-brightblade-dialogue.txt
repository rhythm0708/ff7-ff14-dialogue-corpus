I trust you know your lives are forfeit.
Ser Adelphel Brightblade!
What sorcery is this?
Do not be disheartened, my friends. We must give it our all!
How did he transform into that monstrosity?
I fear we have little time to ruminate. Come, my friends!
The statuesâ”€they're alive!
They would turn the Vault itself against us?
Ser Grinnaux. I should have known you would be here.
I'll cut you to pieces!
You bested him once before. Together, we shall do so again.
His title as a knight of the Heavens' Ward is well earned.
You fought well, my friend, but our mission is far from over.
Still no sign of the archbishop.
He cannot be much farther.
Gargoyles!?
I'd expect nothing less from the Vault's defenses.
He means to escape by airship?
We have to hurry!
