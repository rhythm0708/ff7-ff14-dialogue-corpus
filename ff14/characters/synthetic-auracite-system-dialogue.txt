It's not working! Ready another sample─the one taken from Castrum Abania!
Now loading data sample XII...
Increase generator output to maximum! Activate the magitek field─full power!
It works, it works! Hahaha! Arch Ultima is unstoppable!
Unstoppable? We shall see about that.

Nidhogg! Show them your fury!
Taste my lance!
Garleans and their machina...Now...where are you, Gaius?
Are you all right!?
Peer into my past, did you?
Well, I didn't quite relive the experience as you did, but I bore witness to it all.
I'm still not sure what I think of this gift of yours. But no matter.
Our confrontation was cut short when the imperial guard arrived. It was then that Zenos took his leave. Citing boredom.
To think their research into the Echo could bear such fruit...
Escaping death, jumping from one body to the next, and returning to his own after all this time... He is an Ascian in all but name.
It beggars belief, aye. But no more than a hero traversing the rift between worlds.
My concerns are far more prosaic. With the Emperor dead and the crown prince missing, the Empire is in disarray.
Until order is restored─assuming it even possible─we needn't fear an imperial reprisal. And for reasons of his own, Zenos took it upon himself to rid the world of Black Rose.
Riol has already gone to apprise the Alliance leaders of these developments. We may leave the matter in their hands for now.
Then perhaps we have seen the last of the fighting at Ghimlyt. Though if it comes to civil war, I cannot help but fear for the provinces...
Ah, I'd nearly forgotten to ask─what became of Gaius? Did he not escape with you?
That he did, but we parted ways shortly after leaving Garlemald. He claimed another threat had arisen which demanded his attention.
He didn't elaborate, but the absence of some device or other in the capital gave him reason to believe they're planning something.
Lest you worry, I believe he has well and truly shed the Black Wolf's pelt. Conquest is no longer his objective. We may safely leave him to his own devices.
Well, it's nice to have one less foe to worry about...even if we do have a mysterious new threat to look out for instead.
Speaking of which, I'll see that Riol and our shinobi are made aware. Though we still know next to nothing, it can't hurt to be vigilant.
Well then, with Black Rose nipped in the bud, I believe I've fulfilled my part of the bargain.
That's...true, buuut...with the Archons still slumbering away, we were hoping you might agree to stay with us for a little bit longer...
Sorry, but I'm not inclined to extend my contract. Gaius isn't the only one with business to attend to.
Thank you for your help then, Estinien. I see why Alphinaud admires you so.
...Hmph.
Farewell, my friend. See that you don't make a habit of dozing off in battle.
Hmm. I suppose we should all be getting on, then. As ever, we will see to the Archons' needs. In the meantime, why not get some rest? You've more than earned it. Go on.
You must be shattered after all that hopping back and forth between worlds. Why not stay here and rest for a while? I'm sure Beq Lugg can manage without you. They've got enough Scions to help them, if you ask me!
