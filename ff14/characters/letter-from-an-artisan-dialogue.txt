You who are reading this letterâ”€I bid you imagine the countless adventurers who call this world home.
I daresay it isn't difficult to do so, for that is reality as it stands. Yet we mustn't take it for granted, for what we have now is the culmination of much hard work by full many souls.
Souls including your good self. Adventurers breathe life into this world, each one of you giving rise to a grand tale, and I hope you never forget this.
Thank you for taking the time to cast your eyes over these words. Wherever your adventures may lead, may you find happiness.With utmost respect,A Nameless Artisan
