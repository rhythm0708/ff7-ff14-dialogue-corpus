<gasp> Impossible!
Hm?
Another kind of mechanical soldier!? It looks dangerous! We'd better destroy it!
Uwaaah!
Should we give chase?
I think it understood our words. It might be worth asking it some questions.
...Erenville? Are you alright? You look like you've seen a ghost.
I-It's nothing. I'm fine.
Well, it went off in the direction we're headed anyway, so let's try to track it down.
It's faster than it looks.
I do not see it...
No sign of it over here.
Nothing but birds over here.
That voice... Could it be...?
You found it!?
To the northeast? Then it must be bound for the mines.
Come on, then!
It could well be a trap, so let's not rush in too quickly.
An old coal mine? It appears to have long since been abandoned, like so many other places.
The stones in those crates... Could it be turquoise?
So it went in here?
I think it's safe to assume it went into the mines.
I heard faint voices coming from inside.
So it's not alone. But we're still going in, of course?
This may be a trap. Be ready for a fight, everyone!
I'm not worried. We've had to improvise countless times before, after all.
It would appear no one has worked these tunnels in quite some time...
This tunnel just keeps going...
A device made with electrope. It seems to be the only one here.
I can hear them. Several people up ahead.
Hmm. I can't make out their conversation with the echoing.
Let's keep going. Stay on your guard.
Uh...
What is this?
Erenville!
Ugh, a trap!?
Elene'shpya? It really is you!
...Huh?
