Queen Sphene has come to see you.
We're here, Namikka. Everything is going to be all right.
Wu... Wuk...
What's the matter, dear?
It can't be...
That's the bangle I gave to Namikka!
You know her?
Of course I know her. She was like a mother to me...
I see. She was always willing to lend a kindly ear to others, but rarely did she ever speak of herself.
Is it...is it really you?
She must have arrived shortly before the barrier manifested. For us it was perhaps days, but for her...
Namikka, it's me! Wuk Lamat!
I'm afraid her time with us is nearly at an end...
