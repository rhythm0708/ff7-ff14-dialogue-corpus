Ah, a fellow adventurer. You, too, are here to unravel the mysteries of Sastasha?
I have adventured across this wide realm for more seasons than I dare to count, yet still Eorzea manages to surprise me with her beauty and splendor.
Our journeys are not ended by the attainment of riches or fame. It is an unquenchable thirst for the unknown that drives us into the wilds time and again.
Even if I explored the world for a thousand years, I would never grow weary of this life.
