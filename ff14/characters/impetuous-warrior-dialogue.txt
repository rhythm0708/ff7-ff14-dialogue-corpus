You! Yea, you who have walked Bardam's Mettle. Newborn warriors of the Steppe. Our khan demands an audience. You will come.
I remember those clothes. He's Oronir, isn't he? What should we do?
Ordinarily, I would politely decline. But this may be an opportunity to assess their strength, and we do have some time before the Naadam begins...

We accept your khan's generous invitation. Lead the way.

Most radiant brother Magnai. We have brought the ones you seek.
