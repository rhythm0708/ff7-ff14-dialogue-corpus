Fearsome types clad head to toe in steel, you say? Imperial soldiers, no doubt. I couldn't tell you what they're plotting, but I'm sure it's nothing good.
This one is happy to see dancing one return. What did dancing one learn?
This one sees. Steel walking ones come from Empire. Carry boxes, and go walking deep, deep through trees.
As this one thought! Steel walking ones are up to nasty, no-good things.
This one knows forest well. Steel walking ones try to hide, but this one will find them.
This one would borrow dancing one's map. This one makes markâ”€right here! This is where steel ones hide, this one knows. Dancing one will go looking for steel ones, yes?
Dancing one is back. This one breathes sigh of relief. This one was worried. Hm? Dancing one found something?
Dancing one found paper inside of box? This is a message from Empire?
This one can read walking ones' symbols. Message-paper has names of food and rocks. Food and rocks were inside boxes, this one knows.
But this one does not understand. Food and rocks mentioned all come from home of these ones. How do steel walking ones know to find them?
Is there sneaky one hiding behind this one's wings? Snooping one selling secrets to steel walking ones?
This one fears for this one's home. But dancing one has helped this one much today. Dancing one must promise to always be friend to these ones.
Helpful one arrives at a good time! This one needs helpful one's help!
One of these ones named Claxio ventured outside Little Solace alone. Alone is unsafe! Helpful one must find Claxio!
Claxio struck west after leaving the settlement. Hurry before Claxio ends up in the belly of a beastly one!
