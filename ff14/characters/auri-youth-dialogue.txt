Look! Someone's coming!
People of Radz-at-Han. It warms my heart to see so many brave, resilient souls before me.
Today, I would share with you a great revelation. But before I do, I must make a humble request...
Do not be alarmed, nor avert your eyes. See the one I unveil for who he is, and know that he means you no harm.
Very well. I daresay it can't be worse than the horrors we've already seen.
...Many thanks.
