Ah! I-It's you! One of the visitors from Etheirys! Goodness me, Mappingway wasn't kidding─you really are smaller than the watcher.
Oh, right! You're here to try on a set of clothes, yes?
What would you have me fashion for you today?
Embodies your...what?
Simple and functional. Right.
Fashionable... Right...
Ahem. This will only take a moment.
There we are. All finished!
A perfect fit, if I do say so myself.
I would be lying if I said I understand what bloodlust is, but I assume it's something you enjoy. I made certain the clothes are flexible yet sturdy enough to endure...whatever it is you plan to do while wearing them.
Nothing too billowy or frilly, as you can see. Also light and durable─sure to serve you well wherever your travels might take you!
I'll be honest─I know nothing of fashion, let alone fashion on Etheirys. B-But I'd wager no one down there has ever worn anything like this fine ensemble. Perhaps you can start a new trend!
Would you look at that. Speechless! And there I thought you may not like it.
If you've a mind to try something else, why not speak with my fellow artisans?
I'm sure they'd be happy to oblige.
A fresh change of clothes? Say no more!
Oh no! What happened to your outfit? Not to worry, I have another right here.
