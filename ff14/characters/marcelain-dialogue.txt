You are the appointed captain of the sellsword contingent? Then, welcome! There is no shortage of bladework to be done!
As we speak, Dravanian skirmishing parties are harrying positions across the central highlands.
I've assigned the Crystal Braves and your fellow adventurers to contain these scattered attacks─and for the present, I would have you join them.
This is, of course, merely a precursor to the assault on Ishgard proper. The wily serpents seek to divide and confuse our forces, but we will not be so easily drawn out of position.
The Temple Knights will remain on the Steps of Faith and continue our preparations. When the Horde arrives in force, they shall face a wall of Ishgardian steel. Report back to me once their advance skirmishers are slain!
What news, adventurer? ...The reinforcements? ...Decimated, you say? Dravanian devils! Damn their scaly hides!
Hold fast to your grief and fury, my lady. We will avenge the deaths of your fellows in the battle to come!
Ere you commit yourself to the siege, you should know what it is you are tasked with defending. Beyond the Gates of Judgement lie the Steps of Faith─a great bridge of stone that leads directly to the city of Ishgard.
More than simply a means to cross the Sea of Clouds, the bridge serves as a foundation for the arcane wards that form the barrier we call Daniffen's Collar.
Alas, in dispelling the barrier's outermost layer, that thrice-damned witch Iceheart stripped the bridge of its protection, and thus are the dragons now able to land unhindered upon the Steps of Faith.
Should the Dravanians succeed in destroying the remainder of the wards, the winged devils will be free to swarm within the city itself.
Needless to say, we cannot suffer that to happen. It shall be our task as defenders to prevent any harm from coming to those parts of the bridge wherein the wards are sealed.
Three yet remain, and we have dispatched our forces accordingly. I would ask you and your comrades to accompany our defenders at the outermost ward.
I should hope that includes us as well, yes?
The Scions of the Seventh Dawn!?
We could not well stand idly by while the Horde threatens the good people of Ishgard.
Indeed. To do otherwise would go against all that Master Louisoix has taught us.
As for where we may be of most assistance, I think it prudent we divide into two groups. Yda and I will join the rear guard.
Right! If the dragons should reach us, we'll be sure to give them what for.
Thank you. All of you. Pray speak with me again when your preparations are complete, and together we shall stand against the Horde!
I trust you are ready, then? Good. Come, let us make for the battlefield!
