In the year 1564 of the Sixth Astral Era, the Amalj'aa summoned Ifrit, their patron god. Accounts describe the being as a gigantic, lizard-like being with a potent command of fire-aspected magicks.
If we consider that primal summoning is an act fueled by faith and prayer, it is unsurprising, if not expected, that the resulting deiform entity should manifest the appearance and powers with which it is attributed by its worshipers.
What, then, might emerge from the aether should one who believes in an almighty omniscience attempt the same ritual? Would the Scholar Himself grace us with His presence? Some other embodiment of divine sagacity?
Could this man-made god truly be all-knowing? And if it were, whence would such knowledge arise?
I myself have many questions concerning the nature of the ancient world. With no spell to transport me back to the days of old, could I instead summon a being possessed of encyclopedic wisdom of every age? Yet with no means to verify its pronouncements, how could one be certain they were true?
