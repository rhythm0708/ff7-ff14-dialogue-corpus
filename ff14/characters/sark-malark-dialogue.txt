You are called Forename Surname, yes? I have heard of your plight from my friend Glaumunt. As a fellow adventurer and son of Eorzea both, I would offer you my assistance.
In order to infiltrate Castrum Centri, you and your comrades must disguise yourselves as imperial soldiers. The question is how to go about acquiring the uniforms and helms.
There are places a man might purchase them, but individuals who deal in such wares are not the sort to whom you would entrust your secrets.
It would be more prudent, I believe, to procure what you need via traditional means─from the bodies of their recently deceased owners.
The fortified area before Castrum Centri never lacks for imperial patrols. It ought not take long to obtain three sets of gear, one for each member of the infiltration team─Biggs, Wedge, and yourself.
When you have what you need, please return here and allow me to inspect the spoils.
Were you able to obtain three sets of imperial equipment?
...Damaged, as I had suspected. In their present condition, I fear these uniforms and helms are like to draw suspicion.
They must be repaired, if only superficially.
Fortunately, the blacksmith Eginolf at the Diamond Forge in Rowena's House of Splendors should be able to hammer them into shape in no time.
I've already sent word ahead, and have been assured that he is expecting you. Worry not─we have already impressed upon him the need for utmost secrecy as to the nature of your mission.
