Th-Thank you... I thought I was done for...
Hm? Mehvan? She is a friend of mine, too, but I have not seen her...
She must still be out there somewhere, trying to avoid the beasts. And with her child, gods... Worry not for me─I can make my way back to the village on my own!
Forename, wait! Purusa lies just up ahead, but something terrible has happened!
The beasts have come, and many have already been killed!
Alphinaud and Alisaie have gone to do what they can, but there are so, so many─more than I could count. You must be ready...
I...I am fine. I will be safe hiding here. Please, you must help those people!
