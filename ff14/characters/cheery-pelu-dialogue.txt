I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities─you need to keep an ear out if you want to succeed in business!
Time to play our parts.

Follow me!
This way!
There. That Xbr'aal fellow.
Share with him how happy your imaginary deal with me has made you. Once you've put on an appropriate display, we can continue to our next performance.
We want Wawkesa to notice us─be loud and convincing.
Something I can do for you, friend?

Are you...confused? I know I am.

A rare gemstone from that Hhetsarro merchant, you say? I envy the profit he must have made from such a sale! Since the stairs were destroyed, I've not been able to peddle goods at my usual haunts!
I would advise that peddler to keep an eye out for shady characters. Rumors of good fortune have a way of attracting bandits in these parts.
A good start, but I would make certain Wawkesa is aware of me. Let's continue.

That Moblin over there looks amenable to conversation. The stage is yours, Forename.
Share your “good fortune” with that Moblin merchant too, if you would. We need to make sure these rumors attract Wawkesa's notice.
Pfff... Kohhh... What can Mobbie do for you?

Pfff... Kohhh... Whatever you are doing, Mobbie would like you to stop!

Pfff... Kohhh... The Hhetsarro sold you a sparklestone for your collection?
Well that explains your giant joysmiles! Mobbie is happy for your happiness! Mobbie is also jealous of the merchant and all the jinglyshine he must have made!
Pfff... Kohhh... Be careful when trading tongueflaps around here. There are sneaky, greedy brigands who will get bigeyes and grabsnatch that merchant's jinglyshine...and your sparklestone, too!
That should be enough...but perhaps one last act to drive it home.

Do you see that cheerful Pelu? Tell him the tale of your precious gemstone, and then we'll be done with this part of the charade.
Just this one last performance, I promise.
How nice to see a smiling face! Care to share the reason for it? I've heard nothing but mumblings and grumblings since that storm passed through!

Hm? What am I to make of this!?

A passing peddler had the very gemstone you sought for your collection!? That is a stroke of luck!
And I'll wager the merchant was just as pleased to fill his pockets with your grateful coin, eh?
Well, I'm inspired to go and earn some pel of my own. Who knows? Maybe opportunity will find me, even as it found you!
Ah, my most valued customer. The profit from that single purchase of yours should see me through weeks of idle leisure!
Traveling with such a fat purse and no sellswords is tempting fate, so I shall make Earthenshire my last stop and then return forthwith to Tuliyollal.
Did you see? The rat has come for a nibble.
You played your part to perfection, Forename. A womanman of many talents, just as Thancred and Urianger described.
Now let us lure Wawkesa out and spring our trap.
Let us execute the final stage of the plan.
I will set out towards Earthenshire alone and unarmed, the better to sell the act of a defenseless merchant. Assuming Wawkesa is watching, he will likely wait for some quiet stretch of the road before accosting me.
I'll be relying on you to follow closely behind, remaining hidden until the time comes to spring the trap on our bandit king. Just remember: we need him alive.
Wawkesa will tell us what he's done with Lamaty'i.
I hear business has been good to you, master merchant. How about you share some of the profits?
And by “some,” I mean every coin you have!
Y-You're that gemstone collector... Oh, I see what this is. We've been tricked!
Spit in your eye! Men─kill these vidraal!
Slippery vermin. We'll have to interrogate his underlings instead.
If you would be so kind, Forename. Pray leave them capable of speech.
I would assist you, but alas, I am unarmed.
