Shkoh! Shkoh! Gobbieflock in danger! Uplanders take gatekey! Open Headgate!
I pray we're not too late.
Shkoh! Shkoh! More fastness! More fastness!
Shkoh! Brayflox shall see to thunderfoot!
Gobbie...boom?
I was expecting Brayflox to be more...helpful.
Well, at least now the way forward is open.
The dragon! It won't escape this time!
Pshhh... Shkohhh...Goodly uplander has thanks of gobbieflock!
Flighty-beast was tricksy foe, but uplander outwitted with plansmaking. Uplander has goodly head for fighty-think.

Cheese is stinkysweet gobbietreat! Specialmake with secret gobbiearts!
No party complete without gobbie gouda, Brayflox everysay!
<sniff> <sniff> ...I gather you solved Brayflox's little problem?
By the gods, that unholy stench! This is─ugh─definitely goblin cheese.
Judging from the smell, this should be quite flavorful.
Hm? How is it made? Ah...it's best you remain ignorant of such things. I still remember when I learned what kind of milk they use... <shudder>
Bravo, Forename. Thanks to you, our guests shall be honored with a marvelous banquet.
But what good is an exotic feast without an equally exquisite aperitif?
Luckily, I know just the person to ask. Make your way to Wineport and seek out Shamani Lohmani, another former member of the Company.
All you have to do is give him this order slip. He'll take care of the rest.
Oh, and if you're wondering if this is merely a ploy to test your patience, I assure you I do actually need that wine. And while you're there, give Shamani Lohmani my regards.
