You're the Warrior of Darkness! I never dreamed I'd have the honor...but why are you in Eulmore, if I may ask?
Your home is in danger, and you've come seeking help...
If there's anything we can do for you, you need only ask. Things could be better here, of course, and we've got a long road ahead of us, but we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and yours. And we'll never forget that.
I once feared the sin eaters and the Light with every fiber of my being, but no longer. There's too much that wants for doing; we can't afford to be ruled by fear. You taught me that.
Spoken with the people, have you? While they're not without their worries, I'd like to think that, on the whole, they're not as prone to melancholy as they once were.
The people know and respect you, Forename. I've no doubt that everyone will rally around you in your hour of need!
So the people are of one mind in their desire to help. Good, good.
Why, just earlier, I overheard a conversation about how the Warrior of Darkness is seeking to save their home. Your tale is spreading quickly.
Then the plan has unfolded precisely as you envisioned.
All that remains, then, is to assemble the citizens and explain Forename's need to gather Light...
For better or worse, I'm mayor of this city. I'll do my best to win them over.
