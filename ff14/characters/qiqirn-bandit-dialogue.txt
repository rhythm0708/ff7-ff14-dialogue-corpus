Who dares come to loot our man-flesh! Ours to eat! Ours to eat!
We knew it'd come to this. Kill them quick, before they alert the others!
By Rhalgr, what did I ever do to deserve this? I've gone to bed hungry for months. I'm skin and bones! I'd hardly make a snack, much less a meal...
Oh, you found him!
W-Wait...are you here to rescue me?
Your sister sent us. It's going to be all right.
My sister? Oh, Rhalgr be praised, she's safe! And you...you lot fought your way in here just for me? To think there are still good, brave folk in this world...
We should go before the Qiqirn return in force. Do you still have the tributum?
Oh gods, the tributum! The imperials will be wondering where I am! I have to go!
What, right now? In your condition?
You don't understand─we were given a warning last month for being short! If I don't make it in time, there's no telling what will happen to me and my sister!
I'm glad we saved him, but seeing him run off like that... I've got a bad feeling about this.
Listen, Forename, Meffrid... I think we need to go after Wercrata.
Wait─you had better not be thinking of stopping him! You heard what he said─if they don't pay one way, they'll pay another!
I know that, I do, and I don't want to interfere! I just...I just want to see that he makes it there safely.
...If that's the sum of it, then fine. Let's head down and see if we can't pick up his trail.

Any luck?
A chocobo feather, is it? Aye, by my reckoning, it came from Wercrata's bird, in which case...
There's a collapsed bridge just around the bend. Hug the rocks and stick to the shadows. We'll find him soon enough.
Any minute now, I expect he'll come thundering 'round the bend and─ Hear that? Get to cover, quickly now!
Are they imperials?
Worse. Skulls. Listen, Lyse─whatever happens, stay hidden and do not intervene. Understood?
What?
