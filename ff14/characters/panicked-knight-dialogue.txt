Yes, yes, my lord!
See! See here the true nature of the highborn! With lies and deception they lead us to our doom, and dare we raise our voices in dissent─death is our reward!
This is the choice they have given us, brothers and sisters! Death by dragon's fang or death by nobleman's command! Death to all we hold dear!
I spit on your choices, nobleman! You will take no more from me... No more! NO MORE!
What have you done!?
I─ I only did as you ordered, my lord...
I gave no such order! I did not! I...I never meant for anyone to...
I daresay that could not have played out any worse, given that the first commander and Lord Artoirel are not here to take control of the situation.
I spoke with a messenger who said that they would be returning shortly, but until they do, naught will be done. Lord Emmanellain has retreated to the barracks and is refusing to speak to anyone.
Therefore it falls to us to ensure that order has been fully restored. Come, let us walk the streets and speak with the people.
