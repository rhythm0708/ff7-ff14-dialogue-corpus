Greetings and well met, my friends. Climb aboard, climb aboard! There is room enough for you all!
Forename. That we might improve our odds of success, we will divide into two parties upon arrival─one composed of myself, the other you, Gosetsu, and Yugiri.
Given our inferior numbers, we must needs finish the battle quickly. And so, while you and yours draw the enemy's attention, I shall steal over to the keep.
Lest you worry, though I've been to the castle only a handful of times, my father saw fit to drill its layout into me. I could find my way blindfolded.
Even should one meet with misfortune, the other will reach Yotsuyu. Agreed?
Then let us be about it. For Doma!
I am Gosetsu, samurai of Doma─
Now is not the time to be announcing yourself!
Metal toys will not stop us!
My blade will make short work of this!
This appears to be the guardian of the gate!
Let us end its watch!
On to the inner ward!
We're coming for you, Yotsuyu!
Is that your idea of an ambush?
Have at you!
Quickly, between barrages!
Ugh, I'm too old for this...
An unusual machina...
Unusual or no, it will fall all the same!
Come, let us head inside!
I pray Lord Hien is safe...
What? Are they shinobi!?
Naught but pretenders! Our techniques are beyond their ilk!
That such a barbaric weapon should defile our beautiful castle...
It will not do so for much longer!
EOOORZEAN... EOOORZEAAAN... COME OUT AND PLAY...
DEAREST OF AAALL MY ENEMIES... I HAVE NEW TOYS TO SHOW YOU!
This aura... 'Tis as if he were a beast.
And one with nothing to lose.
