...Sweat, grime, and blood. Aye, you reek of blood. An adventurer, unless I am mistaken. What brings you to Wineport?
An order? Let me guess─a request for the finest vintage I can muster.
<sniff> <sniff> The paper smells of loam and perfume. Costa del Sol. And there is also the─<cough>─unmistakable odor of goblin cheese...
Yes, Master Gegeruju would not settle for anything less than the best. Dyrstweitz and his crew must be quite busy preparing an exotic feast, hence his decision to rely on an adventurer.
Ah, but perhaps you are confused. This display of deduction was not intended to impress you.
When one loses his vision, he is forced to compensate in other ways. But you've no interest in my affairs─you wish only to discuss the wine, I suspect.
Life can be so delightfully unpredictable. I always had a passion for wine, but it wasn't until I was forced to retire that I could pursue it as more than a mere hobby.
It wouldn't have been possible if not for the savings I amassed during my time as a mercenary, of course. Say what you will about the nature of that work─none can deny that it pays well.
Ah, but you grow impatient, and Wheiskaet must have his wine. Herein lies the problem: nothing in my possession is of sufficient quality for this occasion.
The best vintages in town are hoarded by Byrglaent, who owns and operates the largest winery in Vylbrand.
Somehow, I doubt he will be receptive to your request, but given these circumstances we must needs beg his assistance.
