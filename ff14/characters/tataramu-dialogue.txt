I wonder if the Ehcatl Nine would enjoy the Starlight Celebration...
Perhaps I might persuade you to continue your work as the Saint of Nymeia?
Splendid! Gridania will be ever the merrier for it.
Donors from across the realm have sent us a wide array of delights this year, so I would have you distribute them to younglings who pass by the amphitheatre.
While I won't insist on the costume, you should know that you look very well in it. I shall leave the decision to you.
Do make sure the children who pass by the amphitheatre receive their gifts.

Well, this is rather unexpected. I have but just finished attending to state business and thought to observe these celebrations ere I return to Limsa Lominsa.
I understand the Bismarck donated baked sweets to be distributed as gifts.
Though I have little familiarity with the Starlight Celebration myself, one does not soon forget the joy of receiving such festival delights as a child.
I pray that the Bismarck's contribution provides Eorzea's young ones with many a fond memory.
Thank you for dedicating time to play saint for the younglings. Seeing the city awash with their bright smiles is but one virtue of this fine festival.
Were those not Fen-Yll boots you gifted just now? The atelier is known for its sturdy shoes, so I imagine that child will be afforded endless hours of play.
I used to run through these woods as a youth, and I can assure you that feet are the first to feel winter's bite. How reassuring to know that our children will spend the coldest season in warmth and comfort.
So you're the Saint of Nymeia I've been hearin' so much about! I snagged an invitation from the Adventurers' Guild, hopin' for some seasonal refreshment, and between all the smilin' youngsters and twinklin' lights, I haven't been disappointed!
That garment you just handed off was Weavers' Guild craftsmanship, wasn't it? I'd recognize that style anywhere.
A certain fancy guildmaster's goin' to hear how well that poppet liked his present just as soon as I get back to Ul'dah. If he doesn't melt to rose oil on the spot, I'll eat my proverbial hat!
Ah, MistressMaster Surname! What an honor it is to have witnessed such a heartwarming and philanthropic exchange.
You gifted that child a Skysteel Manufactory mammet, did you not? I find it fascinating that toys created via modern technologies should be coveted for so traditional a festival as the Starlight Celebration.
In truth, I am conducting research into how such Ishgardian festivals are perceived and promoted in neighboring nations.
When I penned The White Yonder, I developed a particular curiosity regarding the effect of interpersonal exchanges on the transmission of cultural practices, you see.
Lord Emmanellain generously granted me leave to embark on this journey of inquiry, and I hope to compile what insights I gain here into another volume. ...Ahem. A happy Starlight to you, my ladylord.
...What? Is my presence here so peculiar?
I have it on the authority of foreign traders that this Eorzean ritual is not simply a sacred distribution of gifts to children─it is an ideal setting in which to find my Nhaama.
Hmph. Your denial is futile. Hidden somewhere in this wood is my gentle maiden of dusk, my ethereal dancer in the morning mist. I am certain of it.
...Yet all those I have yet observed appear to be mewling children, chattering kin, or shamelessly courting couples.
Had I been aware of such a complication, I would have sought divine guidance before coming here. Then again, delaying my journey might have precluded attending this auspicious ceremony...
...Nay, I am born of the mighty Sun and naught can elude my gaze. Let legend remember that Magnai of the Oronir sought his Nhaama alone and discovered her wreathed in the light of Gridania's stars!
Why, Forename! What a lovely surprise.
Before you ask, I am not here on official business. My wife wished to see the festivities, so I have accompanied her. That is all.
So much for Starlight cheer! You know once, when the twins were little, Fourchenault gave them puzzles complicated enough to stump half the Studium─and that was genuinely his best effort at gift-giving!
But lo and behold: Alphinaud solved his without batting an eye, and Alisaie couldn't even be bothered to open the box. My gift was seeing this man dumbfounded by his two talented and drastically different children.
Yes, well. The very notion that the Saint of Nymeia might visit our Sharlayan household was flawed from the outset. Regardless, such charades are behind us now; our children no longer lie awake hoping for Starlight presents.
Perhaps. But I certainly wouldn't refuse a gift, were it offered.
...It appears I have business at Fen-Yll Fineries after all. If you'll excuse me.
That's right─I must send Mila a little something as well. Did you know she's begun work at the High Crucible? Oh, I am so proud of her!
Thank you for your assistance. I trust the younglings enjoyed their presents?
Should you have further time to spare for saintly duties, do not hesitate to return. May you have a very happy Starlight, adventurer!
