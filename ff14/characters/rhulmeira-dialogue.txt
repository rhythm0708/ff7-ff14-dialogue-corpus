You mean the blasphemy? That's what the Radiant have been calling it, anyway.
I saw it, too. We all did. I was standing here at the counter as Mehryde poured me a drink, when suddenly there came this dreadful sound, like a pained, angry groan.
It was unlike anything I've ever heard. I turned around in shock, and from an ominous cloud of black mist rose the creature, enormous and ghastly to behold.
As for what happened next...to recall it sends shivers up my spine. By some stroke of fortune, I was able to slip outside before the beast got its claws on me...
But the sight that greeted me offered no solaceâ”€the blue sky above turned red as blood. Mehryde, myself, and the other survivors clung to each other for dear life until the Radiant Host came to our aid.
...Wait. Did I hear you correctly? The beast manifested before the sky began to burn?
I'm certain of it. The windows here offer a clear view of the sky, and I saw nothing out of the ordinary until the beast appeared and began to rage.
Even if you're not here to drink, why not stick around and make the place look less empty? I only ask that you mind the carpet. There may be a few bloodstains concealed beneath...
