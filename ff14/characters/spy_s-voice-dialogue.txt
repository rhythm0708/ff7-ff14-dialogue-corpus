There is more, my lords. They were aided by one of our world, who transformed Scarmiglione's soul into crystal!
Crystal!? This one speaks of memoria!
Now there's a word I've not heard for an age. It'd bring a pang of nostalgia to my breast and a tear to my eye...
...If the very notion wasn't absurd! The gifted are gone, drowned in Darkness─as were we all!
And yet Scarmiglione still does not answer.
Were he alive, he would have returned by now.
Weakest though he was, his ability to regenerate was without peer.
Hmph!
If this account is true─if a memoriate has survived...
They cannot be suffered to live.
Leave this matter to me, Lord Golbez.
I, Barbariccia, shall strike down any who pose a threat to our plans.
'Tis true you are a proven commander, well suited to leading an assault.
And when I have succeeded, I would beg a boon of you.
What do you desire?
The dragon's aether. All that remains.
The insolence! Know your place!
With respect, my locks are free as the wind. Without incentive to sway them, I know not whither they will blow.
Boldly spoken. I trust you will not disappoint me.
Upon this flowing hair and my immortal soul, I will not fail.
Then go, and impress upon these interlopers the futility of defiance.
My lord!
Farfarello keeps to the fringes of my domain. This way.
The voidsent here don't answer to a master. They can do as they please.
But all must answer to the hunger, and seek out prey when they need aether.
Except Farfarello and Ciriatto, that is─they are content to take from one another. Barring an incident, they dare not venture out.
When he takes flight, Ciriatto will not seek shelter until he is utterly spent. Farfarello, on the other hand, prefers to hide in the same place. Come.
