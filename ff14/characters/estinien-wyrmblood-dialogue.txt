They will know the wrath of the Azure Dragoon!
Hold your ground! Should this barrier fall, Ishgard will be awash in flame!
I will see this through to the end. Upon my lance, I swear it!
Know your folly!
Is this...the end...?
Their champion approaches! Make ready!
If he would taste my lance again, so be it.
Hold nothing back!
Our enemy is not without weakness! Keep it up!
Fall!
The true battle begins here!
The true battle begins here!
Come what may, we must hold on!
Stand clear!
Look out!
No...
I... I don't want to...
I... I don't want to...
The final ward is weakened. Hurry, we must end this now!
The final ward is weakened. Hurry, we must end this now!
The barrier cannot suffer such an attack...
We are the shield that keeps the Holy See! Even if it should cost us everything, they cannot be suffered to pass!
Let us show them the strength of Ishgard's finest!
It's now or nothing!
Commander!
We stand as one!
Urgh!
Graaaaaah!
Damn this infernal heat!
Halone, I beg you─grant us strength!
Halone, I beg you─grant us strength!
Ishgard will not fall. Not today!
We...must not...falter...!
We must hold on! We must!
