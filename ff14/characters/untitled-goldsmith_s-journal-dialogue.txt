Today, in a world not my own, I met the most beautiful voidborn creature. She was so unlike her ravenous brethren. Eyes blazing not with hunger, but trembling─like a candle's flame, threatening to flicker out at any moment.
I wonder if “she” is even the proper word. Such distinctions seem inconsequential. Insignificant, even.
All that matters is the love I feel for this exquisite, transcendent being!
