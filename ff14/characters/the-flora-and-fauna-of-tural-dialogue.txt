Every land has given rise to unique wildlife, and the continent of Tural is no exception. Yet while some of her creatures have become a familiar sight in Eorzea, many and more exist that are rarely seen this side of the Indigo Deep.
This tome introduces a select variety of species as described in the testimonies of sailors and adventurers.
AlpacaAccustomed to Tural's craggy mountain ranges, this four-legged beastkin has been domesticated for seemingly hundreds, if not thousands, of years.
Their soft, white fleece is highly prized by weavers, while their strong legs and sure-footedness make them capable beasts of burden.
WivreThis ferocious scalekin is native to the dense jungles of Tural. The Mamool Ja have succeeded in taming them and utilize their prodigious strength for manual labor.
Given their immense size and power, it should come as no surprise that the wivre is also employed as a siege beast. Enemy fortifications cannot long withstand this horned brute's rampage.
ValigarmandaTurali folklore holds that this birdlike creature is the mightiest of beasts and the very embodiment of nature's power. Whether it exists beyond myth, however, is uncertain.
