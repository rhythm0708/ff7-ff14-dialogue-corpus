We've come too far to lose now!
No...
But how...
But how...
The warding!
By the Fury!
By the Fury!
The first ward has been breached!
Fall back, and regroup! The battle is not yet lost!
We must find Papalymo and regroup!
Of course it could never be so easy.
Bah! Damned dragons!
A full retreat seems unlikely...
We must hold them here!
We will see to things here, Forename. Fall back and help the others guard the ward.
We are in your debt.
They mean to defeat us with sheer numbers, then?
Well, it's a good thing I can't count!
We must bring our all to bear!
No holding back!
Take heart, Forename. We will prevail!
It can't end...like this...
Dammit...
This one'll sting!
Brace yourselves!
On your guard, Yda!
I know, I know!
Let us end this here and now!
Now the battle begins in earnest.
We can't give up!
We must defeat their champion at all costs!
Mother...
Gah!
Gah!
Dammit! The second ward!
Brace yourselves!
This bodes ill...
This bodes ill...
The second ward has fallen!
Fall back! There's nothing left to be done here.
We must retreatâ”€now!
We have to protect the last ward!
