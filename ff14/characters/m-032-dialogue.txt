Bzzzt... Additional entity detected.
Look, Forename. The machines here do not appear hostile. Let's see if we can communicate with them...
Begging your pardon, but we are searching for the denizens of this star.
Bzzzt... Unknown life-forms detected. Assigning generic label: interplanetary travelers.
Greetings and welcome to the planet. <blip> <bloooooop>
The planet...what? Could you please repeat that?
It appears your hearing organ is unable to process the name in our tongue. It may be translated into yours as “Alphatron.”
Our people, meanwhile, are called the Omicrons, and you stand within one of our outposts.
The Omicrons, you say... And what is it that you do here?
We are preparing for war.
As we presently do not have a designated target, you have nothing to fear.
Should your star become designated, however, you will be taken into custody and or terminated.
Not a little frightening, these Omicrons, but at least they seem to be forthright...
I will see what else I can learn from this fellow, if you could try speaking with the others?
Go on and try speaking with the other units here. With our combined findings, perhaps we can piece together the state of affairs for the Omicrons.
The rules of engagement forbid the harming of neutral travelers. As long as you abide by our laws, you need not fear for your lives.
