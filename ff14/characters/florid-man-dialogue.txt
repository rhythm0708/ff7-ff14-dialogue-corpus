Whew... After a long, hot soak like that, I'm going to need a gold star ice cream.
What? You don't know gold star ice cream? It's only the most popular treat here in Asyle Volcane!
While it's a little tricky to tuck into, you can't come here and not try it. There's a stall just to the southwest, so you have no excuses!

You'll understand when you see the ice cream, but you need to handle it with care. Wouldn't want to have all that delicious goodness become a puddle on the ground!
