Welcome, Forename. Welcome. That you should be the one to face Good King Moggle Mog XII is of great comfort─to me and to the elementals, both.
As I am sure you know, the moogles are not by their nature a warlike race. Yet should the king be suffered to remain, it is like that his influence will bring about a change in them.
Thus does it behoove us to defeat him quickly, before any lasting damage is done. Make whatever preparations you deem necessary and inform me when you are ready to seek the king.
The wards barring access to the king's sanctuary can only be nullified through the use of enchanted keystones─the selfsame method employed five years ago, when first the king was summoned to Eorzea.
It was with great regret that we were forced to sanction the slaying of the guardians who then held the keystones, for none were in our possession at the time. By the grace of the elementals, however, we have been spared that burden on this occasion.
Kuplo Kopp confided in me that he had been entrusted with a set of keystones by the Mogglesguard themselves. Yet wishing not to betray their confidence, he begged me to find some other means to gain entry to the king's sanctum.
Alas, I have been unable to do so, and dare not labor any longer, for fear that the moogles might succumb to the corrupting influence of their liege lord. We must needs have Kuplo Kopp's keystones, Forename. Pray go to him, and beg his assistance.
He awaits you at Westshore Pier. Impress upon him our great need, and I am certain he will yield.
So? How will you do it, kupo?...Oh, he told you about that.
Well, if there truly is no other way... I'll do it, kupo. Take the ferry to Sweetbloom Pier─I'll go on ahead.
