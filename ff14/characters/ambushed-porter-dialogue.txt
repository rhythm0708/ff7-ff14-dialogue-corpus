Gods bless ye, friend! It's all here, every last─ah, but wait. That chest over there looks like it might've been pillaged.
Bloody hells, that's the personal property of Lord Francel, too...
Are you certain? Clearly an attempt was made to open it, but the lock appears to have held. Nevertheless, if you wish to verify the contents against your shipping manifest, be my guest.
Fury take me, a draconian rosary! In the possession of Lord Francel!?
Yet...perhaps this is not so difficult to fathom. House Haillenarte is whispered to be infested with heretics...
Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention, miss. I shall inform the inquisitors immediately. Under these circumstances, I must strongly advise against associating with House Haillenarte.
Your other introductions will need to be postponed, as well. It is the duty of every Ishgardian to root out and destroy heretics─all else must wait until this matter is resolved.
