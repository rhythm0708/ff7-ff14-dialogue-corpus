You want to climb Khadga!? You couldn't have chosen a worse time...
There was an earthquake earlier, and it triggered a rockslide. I'm afraid the main path to the summit may be blocked.
But if you're determined to go, then I suggest you speak with Sramul. He climbs like a langur, and might know some other way up, if not the gentlest.
If you commit to climbing Khadga, take care not to slip. Most routes were treacherous before, and I don't dare to imagine how they are now.
