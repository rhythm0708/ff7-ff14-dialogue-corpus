What? Walking one wants this one to return to Little Solace? Don't make this one laugh!
This one is weary of living with those who are not these ones. This one wants to be alone.
These ones rely on walking ones for everything. No better than those ones that summoned a primal one! Small wonder this one chose to leave!
This one thought this a likely place to build a home. But then meddling one arrives─forces this one to go deeper into the forest. Meddling one is forbidden from following this one! Away with meddling one!
What? Claxio refused to return to these ones, and went deeper into the forest!?
B-But this one saw touched ones lurking in the forest! Helpful one must hurry─hurry and find Claxio!
Helpful one should search for spools of thread on the forest floor. Those things will lead helpful one to Claxio. But hurry! Hurry, before touched ones take Claxio away!
Meddling one is back!? This one told meddling one to be gone! Tell Komuxio that this one will never go back! Never!
T-Touched ones? Touched ones should go away too! This one is good one! Every one should just leave this one alone!!!
Be on guard, Forename. These sylphs have been tempered―brought under the thrall of the primal Ramuh.
Akin to the Amalj'aa tempered by Ifrit, these sylphs exist only to serve their deity.
They'll not answer to words―only steel. I take no pleasure in this, but it must be done.
