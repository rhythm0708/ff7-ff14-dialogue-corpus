The long cold night is ended, banished by the hand of a fool.♪Your dreams are mine to see, and your heart is mine to rule.♪
I sing a song of love, and such love I bear for you,♪With all my heart I give it, and know my heart is true.♪As I once loved the creatures who upon this land did dwell,♪But they cast aside my love, so I sent them all to hell.♪
Unnngh... M-My head─nay, my very soul is like to split... What...what is this voice?
Resounds through the heavens and destroys all... Oh, gods, this is the Ballad of Oblivion!?
And this fiend used it to lay waste to an entire tribe of moogles! This isn't a song...this is an outrage, kupo!
All this time, the thing I sought didn't even exist...
'Twas I who released this menace into the world. I will vanquish it, even if it costs me my life. Flee this place, the both of you!
Who do you think you're trying to impress?
Forename and Mogta aren't running anywhere, and neither am I. We're in this together─to the bitter end!
G-Guydelot!? Why are you here!?
<sigh> I'm here because you know nothing, Sanson the Stiff. I can't well leave you to your own devices.
Prick up your ears, because I'm not going to say this again: it's the fervent desire to aid our comrades that bestows our songs with power.
And no songs have more power than those you compose yourself! If there's no Ballad of Oblivion to be had, we'll just have to create it!
Yes... Yes, you have the right of it. Let ours be the song of triumph over a legendary fiend!
Hah, I like the sound of that! Now then, there're four of us to battle the siren. This makes the song a quartet, eh!?
