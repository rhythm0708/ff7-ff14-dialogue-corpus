We must protect our wares lest the beasts come again!
...And hurry, I say! There's no time to waste!
Pardon me, but you are in charge of buying and selling here, yes? We have a few questions that we'd like toâ”€
I'm sorry, but I simply don't have time to chat.
If you haven't noticed, we have our hands full at the moment. We must carry all our wares and equipment to safety before those accursed beasts return.
In that case, might we be of assistance? Perhaps we could speak when the job is done.
...Very well.
You can start by helping us move our equipment. Ask the others what to put where.
And you can carry our fabrics.
Go through that door and speak with Kamala. She'll tell you the rest.
Remember, these textiles are our livelihood. Handle them with care.
You'll get your answers after you've kept your side of the bargain. Now, off with you.
