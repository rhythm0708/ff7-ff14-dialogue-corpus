What crops are we raising? Well, as you can see, this one is a variety of grape.
Only needs a good source of sunlight to grow, and the conditions here are nothing short of perfect. Hardly surprising, given that it's native to a particular locale in the very place upon which Labyrinthos was modeled─a region in the south of Ilsabard.
It boasts remarkable habitat diversity, allowing for myriad flora and fauna to thrive. Chilly peaks in the north give way to swaths of temperate plains, which in turn transition into a hot, humid coastline.
Such bountiful territory is ever contested, as you might expect. Used to be called Corvos before the imperials renamed it Locus Amoenus.
The Forum saw it not as a prize, however, but as a researcher's ideal environment─one whose climates we strove to recreate within the confines of Labyrinthos. It's since provided a rich foundation for countless experiments in cultivation.
