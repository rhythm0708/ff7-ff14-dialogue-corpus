I've never seen a craft of this design... It must be Garlond's work. Is there no end to the man's treachery?
The secrets of magitek belong in imperial hands. They are not to be squandered on Eorzean savages!
We are taking this craft back to the fortress! Dismantle it if you must! And bring the engineer! Someone must pay for Garlond's crimes.
...Hm. Scouting party from Castrum Occidens, I'd say. Seems they want your ship, engineer.
Wedge! You have to help him! That fool of a Lalafell was hiding inside the Tiny Bronco!
The Tiny Bronco? Isn't that the new design people have been whispering about?
It's the first airship we've built since the Calamity─the first since Master Garlond...well, since he went missing.
After years of work, she was finally ready for her first test flight. And she was soaring, she really was─till those bastards blasted her out of the sky!
All right, pay attention: we're going to hit these imperials hard and fast. If they want a souvenir from Eorzea, they can have a knife in the gut, but they're not getting that ship. Oh, and...don't forget to save the Lalafell.
What say you, Surname? Ready to give those curs a hiding?
Like a tidal wave, lads! Charge!
An ambush! To arms!
