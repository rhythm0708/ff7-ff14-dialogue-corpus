All who set forth must invariably pass through the entrance. And while most will not spare the place a second thought, we gatekeepers think of naught else, day in and day out.
Our solemn duty is to ensure that all adventurers can enter unhindered, and this entails keeping signs in good repair and pesky fiends at bay. We're especially attentive when we throw open all entrances at once following large-scale maintenance works.
Inspired by the eager expressions you wear as you set forth anew, we will continue performing our task to the best of our ability!Vigilantly yours,A Humble Gatekeeper
