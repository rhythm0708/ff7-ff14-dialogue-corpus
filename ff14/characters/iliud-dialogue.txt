Is something troubling you, my child? You have the look of one who has endured great suffering. If there is anything I can do to help─anything at all─you need only ask.
Close your eyes and look within. Acknowledge your misdeeds and your regrets. Pray endeavor to atone with an earnest heart, and you shall surely find salvation, my child.
The crimes of which you speak are grave...yet I cannot do that which you ask of me. Be assured, however, that the gods see all. If you would ask them for anything, let it be justice and not vengeance.
...The wild roses? I see. You may speak freely here. We are all friends of the Scions.
How...how could this have happened...?
And you are certain that Minfilia was among those taken by the Garleans?
Let us pray no further harm comes to them...
You may stay here for as long as you wish. It is the least I can do for a friend of Minfilia's.
I have known her since she was but a child... Well do I recall the day of our first meeting.
I swore then to do everything in my power to support her, and I will gladly offer the selfsame service to her brother and sister Scions.
So please─no matter what you require, you need not hesitate to ask.
Marques, would you come here for a moment?
