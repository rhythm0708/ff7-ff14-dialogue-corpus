What fortune you have to come hither at this time! Freshly slaughtered, every cut available on request. Organs too─hearts, livers, brains. Or a brace of blood sausages, if you desire only a snack!
A Doman? Poor meat they make, Domans─ I jest, I jest. Hmm...I did see a young Mol in the company of one some few days ago...
