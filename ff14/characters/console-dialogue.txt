I... How am I to speak of Commander Zoraal Ja?
I admired him. His incontestable strength. His unwavering focus. He was...a man of great passions.
I watched him, captivated by his intensity. From afar─I would not dare approach. And in watching, I came to know him.
His eyes, too, sought the distance─but not as mine did. He yearned not for another, but something else, beyond the horizon.
That gaze would never fall upon me, I knew. I knew...
The experiment will soon proceed to its next phase. And when it does, as he promised...
I will have my heart's desire.
<whirr>
Today... Today...
It should have been today. A new beginning. What I have dreamed of for so long...
I hold a future in my arms. If he could see him─embrace him... Surely, surely, that would be enough...
So full of hope I was. A foolish hope...
Its scales...are blue...
He's your son.
My...
No! I...I can't...
I...I-I don't know how─how could I...? How!?
To raise a child─be a fa-father...
I don't... I-I can't!
No... No! Get it away from me...
Get that thing away from me!
Shhh... It's all right, little one. Papa was just surprised, that's all.
He'll come around. We'll be a happy family.
...Kanilokka's shouting for me. The research hasn't been going well...but I can't let him take it out on my baby.
Hush now, little one. I know... I know just where to hide you...
<whirr>
...That's all of them.
