From swords slashing to armor clinking, from water running to leaves rustling, I have the pleasure of recreating for the stage the various sounds that can be heard out in the world.
It is a challenge and a thrill to produce these sounds, and we draw inspiration from the knowledge that they are heard and appreciated by many.
However, the sounds of a play isn't limited to that which we ourselves create. No, they also encompass those made by the audience and the players.
It is a collaboration between us─a joint performance─and it is my hope that we can continue filling the world with sound together.Acoustically yours,A Humble Theater Sound Designer
