Anotheer green adventurer, I presume?
I thought as much. We cannot allow strangers to wander Gridania unchecked and untested.
Before you rush off and begin pestering every second citizen for work, I suggest you make yourself known at the Carline Canopy. That's the headquarters of the local Adventurers' Guild, in case you were wondering.
The Carline Canopy is the building you see behind me. Speak to Mother Miounne within, and she will take you in hand.
