Help! Someone...<pant>...quickly!
It's Nightshade! We was attacked on the road from the Crystarium─barely escaped with me life!
I suppose we might have predicted this.
Y-You mean you'll help? For free? Th-Thank you!
If I recall correctly, “Nightshade” is a local band of outlaws.
I doubt they'll trouble us overmuch. No more than they already have by interrupting our relaxation, at any rate.
These two have matters well in hand, by the looks of it.
