You thereâ”€halt! You know you shouldn't be here... Explain yourself.
Forgive me, sir! I-I came to deliver the tributum!
...Oh aye? A likely story! Only a fool would dare to come so late.Or mayhap...a Resistance spy.
No! No, you've got it all wrong! I was waylaid by bandits! It's not my fault!
I said halt!
