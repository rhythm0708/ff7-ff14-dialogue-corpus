<blip> <bloop> WARNING. Scheduled dragon restraint maintenance due in: -2,020 years. Failure to verify system integrity may result in unscheduled specimen release.
I am afraid Estinien and I have little to show for our efforts. Did you find anything?
Hmph. I know the one─though I thought the stench more akin to a fire in a manure shed. But it seemed likelier to explode than grant our wish. Surely there must be another?
Only if they are willing to lead us to the node we seek...which I somehow doubt. But from what I recall of the Flagship's design, the node you found could facilitate communications throughout Azys Lla, so we may yet find a use for it.
Spontaneously, you say? Well, that does sound promising. Almost suspiciously so, in fact...
But then you were in possession of the spirit vessel... Hm. I daresay it is indeed the node of which G'raha spoke.
And it was “chirruping,” you say? Very well, let us take a closer look.
<blip> Do you wish to operate the dragon restraint mechanisms?
<blip> <bloop> You do not have the requisite access privileges. Operation of the dragon restraint mechanisms may only be undertaken by the chief technologist and members of the royal family.
Or those with a vessel full of royal blood, perhaps.
