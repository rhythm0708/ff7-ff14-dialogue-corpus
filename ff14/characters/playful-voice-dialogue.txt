Ooh, a visitor! Where are you from, pray tell?
What is that? Where is that? When is that? In your dreams, perhaps?
Forget all about that place, for Il Mheg is your home now. Today and tomorrow and forevermore...
Hmmm... Perhaps this one's hard of hearing... AHEM! WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE!?
Ah, so you can hear me! Good, good!
Come, let's chitter-chatter, jibber-jabber, bibble-babble! Today and tomorrow and forevermore...

Ach! Stone-deaf! How boring!
Still...picking plants t our village is as good as indulging in our hospitality. And who are we to turn you away? Hee hee, stay awhile...stay forever!

I take it you met with some trouble. Apologies for subjecting you to that.
Can I assume from your presence that you managed to find us some looking grass?
Yes, this is the stuff. Thus armed, we should be able to see through the pixies' veil of invisibility. And seeing them is the first step to dealing with them.
Come, let's gather everyone and put Urianger's little trick to good use.
[I've found you. The game is over.]
Nooo, we are found! How did this mortal know our trick!?
Wait, I recognize their souls! These two have been here before!
Look, lookâ”€twins! How adorable!
Awww!
Play with us!
We have neither the time nor inclination to play. We have come to see Urianger.
Ohhh yes, Urianger! The peculiar one!
In return for a place in Il Mheg, he agreed to a riddle contest with us! For seven days and seven nights! Without any sleep! Ahahahahahaha!
Ah, that was so much fun! We must do it again!
I'm sure he'd be delighted. Now, if you'd be so kind as to lift your spell...
Shall we?
Should we?
Would we?
What now?
I don't know. But this is their home, so we must indulge them.
Right, we've made up our minds! We will lift our spell on one condition: that you first lend us a helping hand! Or two. Or three!
Once you've helped solve all of our troubles, we'll let you see Urianger. Pixie's honor!
Well, there you have it. Pixie chores. I suggest we split up.
Ooh, ooh! Look at me, look at me! I have a task for you!
Lydha Lran is our beloved village, and we want it to always look lovely. And it can't look lovely without flowers blooming. And no flowers bloom lovelier than everblooms!
So, here are some everbloom seeds. Take them and sow them here, there, and everywhere around the village. Simple as a dimple, yes?
