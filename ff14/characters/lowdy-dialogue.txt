Welcome, welcome! Find yourself an empty seat, and I'll be with you in a moment.
Cold out, en't it? Here─a mug on the house. Let's get some color back in them cheeks!
'Fraid food'll be a bit longer than usual. We've got a lot of hungry folk to feed what with the conference and all.
<sigh> So many people with cause to celebrate. To think there could be peace in our time, after all them years of fightin'...
When I heard about the conference, I knew I had to come. I knew I had to be here─to do my bit.
My husband, he...he died fighting the dragons, you see... And here we are, about to break bread with them.
You all right, my lover? You look tired. Reckon you could do with a good long rest.
After all you've done, I'd say you've earned it.
Sleep, now...sleeeeeep. Sleep and leave us to our affairs.
This was never your fight.
