Hee hee! You need medicines? Tonics? Potions?
Hmmm, a cure for an ailing voice, is it...?
No, no medicine will cure this. Methinks your songbird has a lump in her throat. It must be cut out, excised, and even then the voice may never heal completely.
Hee hee, poor little songbird. Will they kick her from the nest, I wonder? Or simply silence her chirps?
Hoho, your face! You didn't know!? Of the many hopefuls who enter the city, very few are ever seen to leave. Even as corpses...
Oh, you might see one or two fortunate fools hurled from the balconies, but the rest...? Gone.
A town of nightmares, it is. Not for this ship's rat, oh no no. I am content to scurry around down here, and nibble on the crumbs which fall from the table.
This consultation is over! You have my verdict, and I have my meol! Good day!
D-Did you get my medicine...?
<sob> ...So that's it? What am I to do if I can't sing...?
