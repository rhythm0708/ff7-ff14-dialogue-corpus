You... Surrender your souls...to King Zoraal Ja.
Come forth, my dear souls...
What now!?
So many...
They're gathering...
I won't let...precious samples escape...
Discard the flesh...extract the soul...
Ungh... My head is spinning...
I...I can't move!
Stay calm and keep your distance!
Why not serve a greater purpose...? The King of Resolve's purpose...
Here they come...
Relinquish your souls... For the glory of Alexandria!
More...more souls... The work demands more souls!
More of them?
Relinquish your souls... For the glory of Alexandria!
Would that we could tame the beast... But the seal is already...
The seal? The beast? What was he talking about?
Is that...a storm?
Let's get a closer look!
Something's wrong... Don't rush ahead!
What was that roar? Did it come from inside the storm!?
We may soon face our fiercest foe yet.
Has that thing been sealed away all this time!?
A tural vidraal...no doubt about it.
Careful!
Such strength!
They almost look alive.
Patience will lead us to victory!
Spread out!
This next attack will be fierce. Stay alert!
That doesn't look good!
How deep does this hole go?
I can't even see the bottom!
Watch your step!
Phew... We did it. Somehow.
I felt the earth shake all the way from the cliff!
It's still beathing, if only faintly...
That was too close!
A tyrant of Tural...truly a fitting description.
It mustn't have been easy to imprison such a creature...
For all the talk of my brother felling this beast, he only imprisoned it, like Valigarmanda.
From what I could tell, they sought to transfer people's souls and memories into bestial vessels at that facility.
The tural vidraal explains the need for a remote location. It was doubtless their prime subject.
Though I expect Zoraal Ja did not foresee the opportunities it presented when he imprisoned the creature...
