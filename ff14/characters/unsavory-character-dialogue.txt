Hold yer nose when ye pass the Brume, little lord! A delicate flower like you is like to wilt in our fumes!
You misjudge me, sir, for I am no lord but a humble traveler.
Oh, come to see the sights, have ye? Take a turn down the Hoplon and gawp at the statues?
Bwahaha! Well, if ye've a mind to learn how the better half live, come and have a drink at the Forgotten Knightâ”€if yer nursemaid'll let ye!
My humblest apologies, Master Alphinaud. Pray pay that drunken lout no mind.
Oh, but I must. It would not do to refuse such a heartfelt invitation. Yes, I simply must see this Forgotten Knight for myself.
I trust you see the wisdom in this, Forename. There are few sources of information more abundant than a bustling local hostelry.
Not that I expect to hear any news of our missing comrades just yet. Nevertheless, who can say what we might learn of recent events?
Then I'm coming too!
