Dear adventurer,I am a festival committee member in charge of decorating the cities during celebrations.
While decorations are an oft-unremarked part of events, some of you have noticed the little touches we apply, such as stray bombs and romantic snowmen, and it makes our efforts all the more worthwhile.
As you continue your adventures, it is our hope that the festive ambience we create throughout the year will provide you with joy and respite both.Mirthfully yours,A Festival Committee Member
