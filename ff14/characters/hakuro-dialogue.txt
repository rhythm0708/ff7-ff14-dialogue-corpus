You! Clear the road!
Honorable warriors of Doma! My name is Alphinaud Leveilleur, and I come before you with news of great import─
Silence, boy! You stand upon a battlefield. Begone, or be cut down!
Doma is free! Lord Hien has returned and driven Yotsuyu and the imperials from your lands! We were there─we helped him! There is no need for you to fight for Zenos!
Lord Hien is dead, and you are a liar! What could a boy such as you do against magitek? Throw stones and spit curses!?
Invoke my lord's name again at your peril. We will suffer no falsehoods!
I speak only the truth! Put up your weapons, I beg of you! Let us speak as friends and not shed blood in vain!
If your claims were true, we would gladly sheathe our blades and embrace as brothers.
But since they must surely be false, we would be traitors to accept! Our lives and those of our loved ones, forfeit!
Words are air! You will prove the truth of your tale on the battlefield, or die in dishonor!
