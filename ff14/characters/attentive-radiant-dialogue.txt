Ah, Mistress Forename, I presume. I understand you are here for an audience with the satrap. If you require directions to Meghaduta, I should be glad to provide them.
The satrap's residence is situated in Dharma, the highest part of Radz-at-Han.
To get there, I would ordinarily recommend a route that takes you by the bazaars in the city's north. Due to the state of alert, however, most businesses are currently closed, and the aetheryte disabled.
As such, I will provide you with an alternate path. First, please ascend the steps next to this fountain, then continue left.
There will be more steps, and upon ascending them, you will emerge on Paksa's Path.
Proceed through the large door on the right, and you will arrive at Ruveydah Fibers. Within you will find another sentry who will give you further guidance.
In other words, we head up. Sounds straightforward enough.
You wish to hear the directions again? But of course. To get to Meghaduta, first ascend the steps next to this fountain, then continue left.
There will be more steps, and upon ascending them, you will emerge on Paksa's Path.
Proceed through the large door on the right, and you will arrive at Ruveydah Fibers. Within you will find another sentry who will give you further guidance.
You heard the sentry. We head up.
Ah yes, I know about this portal. It leads to a nearby isle. The treasure vault of one of Radz-at-Han's wealthiest families.
They took the god of luck for their guardian, on account of which they occasionally open up a section of their vaults. For aspiring treasure hunters to try their own “luck”, or so they say.
There are also coffers hidden across the land that act as portals. Find one, and you gain access to the vault.
Something to bear in mind in case you exhaust your funds while on the road. 'Tis a troublesome experience, as I can personally attest.
