The origins of blue magic can be traced back to the esoteric practices of the Whalaqee, a tribe in the distant continent of Tural.
The tribe holds nature in the highest, and in seeking to cultivate a spiritual connection with it, they have learned to harness the power of the wildlife around them.
In exchange for teaching them the common tongue, I was permitted to live among them and train in their ways. Those days were some of the most grueling I remember, but they were tremendously rewarding.
For instance, I had the privilege of visiting Lapis Canyon, the tribe's sacred grounds. It is so named for the ceruleum deposit that wells up to the surface, turning the entire canyon a brilliant blue.
Under a shaman's watchful eye, I finally managed to master the Whalaqee's art and make the animals' powers my own. As no name existed for it in the common tongue, I took the liberty of naming it blue magic
The reason I chose this color, as you will have doubtless gleaned, is for the significance it holds to the Whalaqee. I cannot think of a name more fitting to honor the people from whom this noble magic was born.
