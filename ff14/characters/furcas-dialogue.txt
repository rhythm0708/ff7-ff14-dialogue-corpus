Ah, this land brims with life... Ripe for the harvest!
Ugh!
Such insolence! I will not be denied!
Not good...
And now you're mine!
I can't...
How...
How big must the gate be for their like to come through...
Is this it, then...?
Just like that time...
When Light still shone upon the world... When the Contramemoria still raged...
