You've the commander's permission to enter, then?
Well, well, well... So many visitors. Come to have a good laugh, have you?
Or do you mean to put me out of my misery? To finish what you started? It's about bloody time.
That's not why we're here, no.
Do you remember what I said? How I promised you you'd live long enough to see us win our freedom? Well, I meant it. And not to mock you, either.
You're wasting your time.
All of this is pointless. There's no reason to keep me alive, and you know it!
I killed your menâ”€I killed my men! And you know what my only regret is? That I didn't kill you when I had the chance!
That's a lie, and you know it! You think we can't tell what you're trying to do? That we're blind?
You're a fool, but you're not stupid. You're ruthless. Relentless. You'd give up anything and everything to get what you want.
You didn't come this far, climbing over the bodies of your own brothers and sisters, just to piss it all away!
I see you, Fordola! I see you for what you are!
