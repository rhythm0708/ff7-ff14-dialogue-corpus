I...I have to go back. She calls to me...sings to me...
Ugh... Tell Mimidoa I'm sorry. Give him this. He was...he was right...
Or...or you could release me? Yes...yes...release me. I will go and tell her... Let me...let me go to her...
What did Skyfryn have to say? Hm, that's not terribly helpful. I couldn't care less how much he misses his favorite bar wench. But what was that about a man named Mimidoa?
Wait...I know that name! That's that bastard who grabbed my arse the other day at the pub! Well, if you want to give him that feather, be my guestâ”€I'm not going anywhere near him and his wandering hands.
