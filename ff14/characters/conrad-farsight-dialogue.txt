Quickly now! We've got to reach Velodyna before General Aldynn and his men are overwhelmed!
Scouts, dead ahead! If they see us, they'll warn the others!
Not if we kill them first!
That's the last of 'em! Let's keep moving!
No sign of sentries. General Aldynn must have his hands full.
Then let's seize the bridge and be done with it!
They left a token force behind. Nothing we can't handle!
