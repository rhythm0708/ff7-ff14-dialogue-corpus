What folly is this? Who dares to challenge the Sun?
You came, as I knew you would. For you too are a warrior of the Steppe.
I salute you, traveler, and should be honored to face you alone...but the Dotharl thirst for blood and will suffer no duels.
Bear witness, Father Azim! The soil shall drink deep of blood this day!
The most radiant brother has arrived! A pity...
Rise, brothers of the Sun!
An opening! Defend me, my friends!
Know your place!
The battle has only begun, child!You will not deprive me of my pleasure!
