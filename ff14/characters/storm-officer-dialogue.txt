I am here on behalf of the Maelstrom, Grand Company of Limsa Lominsa, to offer said hero a place of honor within our ranks!
As you can see, Forename, your recent exploits have garnered you the attentions of the Grand Companies of Eorzea.
Each organization would have Ifrit's bane for its own. To this end, all three have sent officers to court you.
They would not ordinarily go to such lengths to enlist a new recruit. That they have is evidence of their high regard for you.
I find myself wondering how word of Forename's deeds spread so quickly. That the Immortal Flames should know of her triumph is to be expected...but what of the other Grand Companies?
Eep!
Your reputation precedes you, Mistress Surname! 'Tis no ordinary woman who can face a primal and emerge the victor!
And imagine our pride when we learned that you began your journey as an adventurer in our own Gridania! Know that the people hold you in high esteem, and that you will always be welcome among us.
The Order of the Twin Adder has need of valiant women such as you. Join your strength to ours, friend, and together let us ensure that peace ever reigns over the Twelveswood!
What a pleasure it is to finally meet you, Mistress Surname! My comrades speak of you in the most glowing terms!
A woman of your talent belongs with the Immortal Flames. Join your strength to ours, friend, and together let us secure a prosperous future for Ul'dah!
The Admiral was not exaggerating when she said you have the look of a hero! Full often does she speak of you, friend.
It is only natural that we should want you for the Maelstrom. Join your strength to ours, and together let us see the grand vessel of Limsa Lominsa to the shores of glory!
