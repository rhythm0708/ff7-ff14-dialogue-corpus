Ships off the starboard bow! Pirate colors!
Pirates? Bloody hells...
Have ye no sense!? Get below!
What is the world comin' to...? Pirates firin' on a ship flyin' Lominsan colors! Bastards either have a boatload of balls, or bugger all for brains.
Ye can rest easy, friends! We've made it out o' cannon range, an' no buccaneer's bark'll catch this flighty temptress once the wind's in her sails.
That was too bleedin' close... Glad one of us kept his head on his shoulders─I reckon I'd've lost mine, otherwise.
If them pirates gave up the chase, we must be close to port. Let's head up on deck an' have us a look, shall we?
By the by, is this your first trip to Limsa Lominsa?
Is it!? Well then, let this journeyed itinerant tell you the ins an' outs of your destination. Ahem!
Thought not! Ah, but I'll wager there've been some changes since your last visit. Allow a journeyed itinerant to apprise you of the current state of affairs. Ahem!
Limsa Lominsa prides itself on bein' Eorzea's foremost naval power.
Weren't too long ago that the place was ruled by pirates, but thanks to the current Admiral's civilizin' influence, the city-state could almost pass for a respectable nation. You'd never guess she was once a rum-swillin' buccaneer herself! Heh heh!
'Course, most folk ain't so quick to change, an' with a town full of liberty-lovin' ruffians, you can imagine how many naysayers an' troublemakers she's got to deal with─like them pirates who took a fancy to us just now.
An' if that weren't bad enough, I've heard the Sahagin are raidin' the coast just as bold as you please. Them're the sea-dwellin' beastmen the locals call “fishbacks,” 'case you didn't know.
Ah, at long last. Land ho!
Behold Limsa Lominsa, a nation blessed by the ocean's bounty an' beloved of Llymlaen, goddess of navigation.
