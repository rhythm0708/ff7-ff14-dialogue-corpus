I know who you are. The so-called champion of Eorzea. Come to gloat, have you!?
I'll wipe that smirk off your face... By the blood of our fallen compatriots, I swear I'll─ Ugh!
Damn... Tore the sutures...
Of all the times... The worst of the lot within striking distance and I can't even muster the strength...
If it weren't for the IIIrd bleeding us, we'd be the end of you...
Vergilia's treachery nearly cost Lord Quintus his life, but we made our escape. Took shelter in a mansion─tended to the wounded as we prepared to strike back─and then...
Night fell and we gathered around the radio...then the roar, the terrible roar. The capital was in chaos, but we were spared...
...If you can call this a mercy. Mind intact, but body broken. A soldier in name alone.
I'd cut you down where you stand if I could. Murderer...
How it must pain Lord Quintus to see our proud legion reduced to this. My suffering, my regrets─they are nothing compared to his.
