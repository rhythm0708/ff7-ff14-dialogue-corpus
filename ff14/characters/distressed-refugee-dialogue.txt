Th-Thank you...
Now go, as fast as you can!
Easy now. Deep breaths.
<pant> I owe you...my life...
Our allies will see you to safety!
Ah!
The end has come!
Just what we need...
I don't like the look of that...Stay sharp!
You take the lead, I'll provide support!
More beasts... I only hope my newfound abilities are enough!
You're starting to get the hang of those things.
They fight hard...but not hard enough!
Help! Someone, please!
No, no, n-no, don't! I don't want to die...
Forward! Let not a single fiend escape!
Wait, that's...
Jullus and the army! So, you've recovered, then!
In time enough to be of aid, for once.
We can speak of it more later. For now, we must fight!
To repay your salvation in kind─or with better.
For Garlemald has her pride!
Of that, I've no doubt!
Good gods... Of all possible saviors, the imperial army?
Oh!
I had hoped to take all of them down at once!
Think a withdrawal might be in order?
Sod that! You-know-who would never abandon these people to their fate.
To be devoured by their former friends─that'd be beyond cruel. These beasts must fall here and now!
Well then, I'd say it's high time we threw caution to the winds!
So long as you spare me the heroic sacrifices.
Now, let's go!
We've lost too many already. G'raha, with me!
Is there no way to break the chain of transformations!?
