Wait, I know you! Sergeant Surname of the Twin Adder! It is an honor to meet you!
I was living hand-to-mouth in Ul'dah, but decided to enlist in the Flames after I heard tales of your derring-do. And now, as fate would have it, I've been sent here to join in the fight for my homeland's liberation.
Ah, but this is no time to talk. I've got to prepare for the operation! Take care, Sergeant! We'll give those imperial whoresons what for!
