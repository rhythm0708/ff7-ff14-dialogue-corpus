You are a genius without peer, Amon. How ever do you conceive of such delightful experiments?
That fool was beside himself with panic when he awoke with the head of a bull! Even his cries for help emerged as so much guttural lowing!
Oh, the memory of it... Haha, my poor sides! My friends and I were so consumed by laughter we struggled to breathe!
No more than entertainment for bored wastrels ignorant of its worth. My all-consuming work...
But it was not their only indulgence.
For they were ever hungry for stimulation. Slaves to the slightest hint that amusement was afoot.
Our nation was ailing...but I would see the poison purged.
I resurrected a legend─our first and greatest emperor.
And just as I had planned, he set our wayward empire back on the path of conquest.
An inexhaustible ambition carried us onwards, always onwards.
Yet he who delivered to us such glory was not to be satisfied.
Heed me, Amon.
No matter how vast one's empire, or full one's treasure vault, all is rendered meaningless by death.
In the end, all is lost...
You know as well as I that the emperor stands to lose this war. And so I have come to claim you.
For while your methods leave something to be desired, we cannot deny the results of your work.
And as fortune would have it, the seat of Fandaniel─your rightful seat─lies vacant and waiting. Take your place amongst your peers, rather than die a pointless death amidst the ashes of your doomed nation.
Send one of your clones to the Crystal Tower that you might see for yourself.
See what lies ahead...
The fall of the empire affirmed the truth. Majestic and tragic...as the emperor foresaw.
Scheme as you like, build as you will. Nothing endures.
What is life, but a brief jaunt ending in emptiness?
So easily distracted! Why, I almost left without saying farewell.
As for your friend, you needn't worry─these pawns are far more useful to me alive as fuel for the primals.
Ah ah ah! If you attempt to pull them free, they will die, so─enjoy tackling that conundrum with your comrades!
We shall meet again! Not in one of these minor spires, oh no, but somewhere more suitably grandiose. Your favorite playmate is ever so eager to see you.
Ah, you are returned! But...where is Mistress Nidhana?
Manusya preserve... Just when we had succeeded in making the talisman...
I-I must report this at once! Meanwhile, please return to the Great Work!
Hm... Bad tidings, I take it.
Thy demeanor bespeaketh consternation, Forename...
...Something's gone awry, hasn't it? What happened?
So it was Fandaniel after all... Damn that bastard!
I'm sure you wanted to do more...but you were right to return here first.
We must tread warily lest we endanger Nidhana and the other captives.
First, we must inform everyone of the situation, Nidhana's colleagues included.
I'll call them together for a gathering...but I think it would be best if you were the one to explain.
Oh, Nidhana... <sob>
Can...can you answer me this...
Though Nidhana is trapped in the tower, she's still alive, yes?
Then...
Then we must make warding scales. As many as we can.
The prototype works perfectly. This, Nidhana proved at peril to herself.
So let us make more scales, that she and all those who were taken might be saved!
Aye! As alchemists, this is how we will help win the fight!
My friends, the satrap has been made aware of the tragedy.
He offers his heartfelt condolences, and reiterates his pledge to provide you with all that you require. To that end, he bade me give you this linkpearl, that he might personally discuss the production of the warding scales with you.
And for our Eorzean visitors, I bear an invitation.
In her report, Mistress Nidhana noted your vital contributions to the talisman's creation.
This fact came to the satrap's attention, and in recognition of your deeds, he wishes to meet you.
In addition to thanking you in person, he would also discuss further avenues of collaboration.
And so, if it is agreeable, will you not accompany me to Radz-at-Han for an audience with His Excellency?
We should be honored, of course. Closer cooperation between our lands can only be to the benefit of all.
Then it is settled. Please come to the gates east of the Giantsgall Grounds, and I will show you into the city.
When last I visited, the city was brimming with life. I expect the tower has dampened the mood somewhat.
Be it here or in Eorzea, all share in the desire to deliver the captives. Thus united, I pray that we may join in common cause with the satrap.
Of the satrap, I only know the common tidbits. That though the position is hereditary, he is not considered a sovereign. And that, despite possessing considerable authority, he wields it sparingly.
Given the esteem in which the locals hold him, however, it's safe to assume he's good at his job. We could do far worse for an ally.
All present? Then let us proceed.
Owing to the threat of the tower, the city is currently in a state of high alert, and strict restrictions are in place for entry.
Though you have been granted special permission, I ask that you remain close to me at all times.
A vast rock squats upon Thavnair, and to its stony surface clings the city of Radz-at-Han.
Ye who enter here are subject to the scrutiny of gods—the gate's most watchful eye.
The orb which beholdeth the truth of all things.
Pass beneath its hot and piercing gaze, bearing down like a second midday sun.
The fragrant haze a mixture of sweet incense and acrid smoke. The cries of merchants mingled here with lively melodies accented by dancers' feet.
Travelers seduced by vivid sound and colors were once swallowed up by patchwork streets.
But no such scenes to savor now. To what somber present does that divine eye bear witness?
Here we are: Meghaduta.
It seems a shame to bring you here directly. Under normal circumstances, it would have been my pleasure to show you the sights.
And it would have been our pleasure to see them. Alas, it seems our tour of the city will have to wait.
I am afraid so. Come, we should head inside.
Your Excellency, may I present our honored visitors.
