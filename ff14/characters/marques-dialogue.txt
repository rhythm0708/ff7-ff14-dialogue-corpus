Yes, Father?
If you require assistance, pray speak with Marques. He is a trifle shy, but I assure you he means well.
I should explainâ”€Marques is a survivor of the battle of Carteneau. Alas, his experiences took a terrible toll upon his mind... Had we not taken him into our care, he would surely have perished in the desert.
Marques, I want you to look after Forename. Do you understand?
Yes, Father...
Excuse me, Forename...do you have a moment? It concerns this broken horologe which was found in the pocket of a man brought here for burial.
There is something...familiar about it...but just what I cannot say. Perhaps if I tinker with the device, it will come to me.
However, I lack the proper tools to do so. I would ask that you journey to Camp Drybone in my stead to obtain a bull-point chisel and a pair of needle-nose pincers.
They are often used by goldsmiths, so perhaps they would be the best people to ask.
Of course, I do not expect you to foot the bill. Here, take this coinpurse. That should cover it.
