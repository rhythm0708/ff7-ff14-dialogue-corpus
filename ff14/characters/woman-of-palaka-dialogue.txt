This way!
Break!
Watch out, Alisaie! This one is not like the rest!
I'm fine!
How predictable!
Not today!
See if I care! I won't back down!
Alisaie! To the other side!
Here it comes again!
Now's our chance!
Understood, Alisaie!
I'm not done yet!
Naught to worry about.
The air crackles with energy... Find cover!
Now, over here!
This is the last one!
As they sayâ”€turnabout's fair play!
Not the barest trace of aether... Maybe there really is no way to bring them back.
Thank you for saving our lives once again!
I remember you, from Purusa. You helped us there, too, didn't you?
Ah, you're from Palaka's Stand! I'm glad you're still in one piece.
...Or you will be, once I see to that injury of yours.
Look out!
Get out of here, quickly!
I won't lose them...not a one. This will be a brighter future.
I won't let a madman's apocalypse ruin everything we fought to achieve!
Get it together, Alisaie! You're embarrassing yourself...and in front of Father, no less.
You might never measure up to our champion...
But we ask too much of her as it is. You mustn't let Eorzea's hero fight alone!
I can look after myself, you know.
Everything's in order, I trust?
I've had enough of this rabble. Come on!
Oho, a trio for the ages!
Just the beginning!
How many are there!?
I had a feeling I'd find you here.
This should be the last of the worst troublemakers. With me!
Jullus will see the refugees to safety. We must keep the beasts at bay!
Keep calm and watch your step!
Damn you!
Ha! They'll have to do better than that!
Leave the healing to me!
I am in your debt!
Now where were we?
You must board without delay. The ship will depart ere long.
Your offer to host us in Sharlayan is most appreciated, but will the Final Days not soon fall upon it as well?
Your hesitation is not unwarranted. The satrap entrusted me with your lives, yet I have failed your comrades.
Nor are you wrong to fear that this corruption will continue to spread. I cannot promise you complete safety, even in my homeland.
What I can promise is that I will do all in my power to protect you.
That power is not inconsiderable. Even now, my countrymen are preparing the vessel that will deliver us to a sanctuary on the moon.
Join us on our journey there and beyond, to new horizons. Come to Old Sharlayan. Please.
We would be fools to refuse such a generous offer made in earnest.
It seems they've a new destination.
The people of Radz-at-Han have known too much suffering. The march to Garlemald will only bring them more, short though it may be.
I quite agree. Fortunately, they have you to look after them.
Yes, well...
Behind you! Just there!
More of them?
Zenos!? Here!?
You'll be all right. Hurry to the airship.
Why have you come?
