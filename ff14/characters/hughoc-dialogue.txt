Hm? Aren't you the eikon-slayer? Damned if I know why you'd bother asking someone like me why I joined the Resistance, but it's simple: if I wasn't fighting for Ala Mhigo, I'd be fighting for the Empire.
You're either with 'em or not, and if you're with 'em, you may as well make the most of it. Food, training, citizenship if you live long enough. You'll die stealing someone else's land, like as not, but that's the choice. But me? I'd rather die here.
Well met, Forename. Have you spoken with the freedom fighters as I asked?
Hmm... As fascinating as they are varied... You have a knack for convincing others to bare their hearts to you. I could not have done better myself.
Many years from now, when these tempestuous times pass into memory, their accounts will serve as a window into the struggle. We must never forget, my friend. Never.
You want to help, do you? Hmm... Seeing as how I'm in no position to leave the stewpot unattended, could you go and ask Tebbe for a variety of herbs? Six sprigs or so of whatever he's got on hand should suffice.
It's not as haphazard as it may seem. Depending on the recipe, it doesn't really matter what sort you add, so long as you add something. I'll be here when you get back.
