Seven hells, at this rate, I'll have to appeal to Maelstrom Command for reinforcements...
Hm? Whatever it is, we don't want any.
Well, fancy that! Just when my kobold problems look like coming to a head, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn turn up, itching to pitch in!
Bloody brilliant timing is what it is! Right, then─let's get to it!
So our friendly neighbors in U'Ghamaro have got much more aggressive of late, just as you said.
Matter of fact, our scouts spotted one sniffin' about the stores just now, likely lookin' to make off with an armful of crystals.
I'll be damned if I'm about to let that happen! Lend a hand and help us search the camp for the little bugger, would you?
Our Maelstrom friends seem notably more agitated than when first we arrived. Do you happen to know why that might be?
A kobold in the camp, you say...?
That would appear to corroborate Urianger's information, yes. But to be so reckless as to infiltrate a Maelstrom camp and draw attention to their efforts is passing strange.
Well, there will be time to think on this later. For the present, we must do everything in our power to prevent Titan's summoning─and that means finding and questioning this kobold.
