So you're the kindly folks who helped my Sibly. I haven't the words to properly thank you, but...I'm truly grateful for what you've done. I'm glad to see my girl smiling again.
Pray do not mention it, sir. We, too, owe Sibly much and more. How fares the preparation for your journey, if I may ask?
Very well, thank you. And with Sibly praying to the legendary Seiryu for my safety, no matter how far I venture from home, I have no doubt that all will be well.
I shall pray for your safety as well. What little we might do to help you on your way, we gladly do it.
Indeed. While sharing the blessing of the divine beasts is a fine thing, naught is more rewarding to our delegation than fostering friendship between our lands.
For all the help you've afforded us, I wish to give you a proper reward. Yet I do not know what might be suitable...
Kweh! Kweh, kweh!
Ryunosuke? Are you saying you wish to accompany our adventurer friend?
Hm, I believe the little one wishes to be your charm against tumultuous waters─and he would be hard-pressed to choose a better companion. We still have Ryuji to aid us in our work, so if you so wish it, Ryunosuke is yours.
Ryunosuke, my little guardian... Thank you for everything. May your divine aura keep our friend safe.
And may you and yours enjoy the rest of the Heavensturn season, my friend. Know that wherever the ryu roars, good fortune shall be upon you.
Though we leave Ryunosuke in your care, his younger brother Ryuji appears content to remain here and celebrate. 'Tis a joy to see him so fervently flapping about in his draconic attire.
May Ryunosuke serve you well, my friend. And may the blessings of the ryu be upon you always.
Well, what do you know! It says “great fortune.” That bodes well for my voyage.
You're so lucky, Papa! I'll pray to Seiryu and ask him to give you lots of good fortune, too!
