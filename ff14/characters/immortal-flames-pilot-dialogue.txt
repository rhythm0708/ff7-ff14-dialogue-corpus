Greetings! We've been expecting you.
But say the word, and we shall depart for Paglth'an at once.
At the cost of his own life did Master Louisoix strike down the primal Bahamut. Whatever the true nature of this new incarnation, it cannot be suffered to threaten this star.
Like most who have spent time in Ul'dah, I haven't always seen eye to eye with the Amalj'aa. But today I will fight side by side with them in common causeâ”€and hope that none of them remember me.
The grasslands of Paglth'an will make for an open battlefield. Many though our enemy are, we will not have to fight against the terrain, at least.
By dealing with Lunar Bahamut and his hordes, so too will we render aid to Arenvald and Fordola. Come, let us go!
Whether he's here or not, we can be sure Fandaniel is behind this attack. And that makes me doubly determined to see that it fails.
I know not what designs the Telophoroi have on Paglth'an, but I do know they must be stopped, for the good of the Amalj'aa and us all.
Ascian vermin! You shall torment my children no longer!
The seat of the Amalj'aa's power doth lie beyond this valley...
We must have faith in Arenvald and Fordola!
