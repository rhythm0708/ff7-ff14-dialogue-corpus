Greetings, good madam. I am Broomsy, my lady's servant of some fifty years. May I say what an honor it is to serve you!
I am given to understand you wish to enter the Great Gubal Library. To find it, pray head east upon leaving this cave. The building will come into view shortly after you reach the collapsed bridge.
I shall go and fetch my fellow familiar on my way to the entrance. When your preparations are in order, pray come and meet me there. It will be my pleasure to unlock the door for you.
You stand before the Great Gubal Library, one of Hydaelyn's foremost repositories of knowledge.
Alas, it has fallen into disuse since the exodus some summers since. In all those years, its halls have welcomed not the coming of a single soulâ”€its floors felt not the loving brush of a broom...
M-Mine apologies, madam! Pray pay no mind to the dreams of a humble broom. You are doubtless eager to venture within and retrieve my lady's tome. I shall unlock the door at once. When you have what you seek, pray return to the cave and report to my lady.
Pray lead the way.
