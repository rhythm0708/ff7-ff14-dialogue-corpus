You are an adventurer, are you not? I know this is sudden, but I have no one else to turn to.
Last night, a gang of bandits from the Quiveron Manse were in their cups, and I overheard them discussing their plans...
It seems they've come to collect gemstones stolen from Copperbell Mines. Nashachite, I think I heard one say. They are to meet with their co-conspirator soon, at the Footfalls─
Wh-Wh-What did you say!?
Illicit exchanges and shadowy dealings! The Brass Blades cannot abide such malfeasance!
Forgive my eavesdropping, Forename─I came to Crescent Cove merely to thank you in person.
I never imagined I'd uncover a criminal conspiracy right outside Horizon's gates!
We must act quickly if we are to apprehend these thieves! I will notify Captain Baldewyn at once!
No, wait! You mustn't! Oh, gods...
You must stop him before it's too late! Captain Baldewyn himself is working with the bandits!
Captain Baldewyn, sir! I've discovered something shocking, something horrible!
Someone has been stealing gemstones from Copperbell Mines and─
Wait, those gauntlets, those boots─why, you're one of Quiveron's men! Sir, that man is a thief and a scoundrel!
