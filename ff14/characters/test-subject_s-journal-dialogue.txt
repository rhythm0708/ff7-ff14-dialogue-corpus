They're recruiting volunteers for a new experiment. I know I'm not as bright as the others, but they wouldn't laugh at me if I was stronger than them. This might be my chance.
Soul transferred few days ago. I can write. Can write good, yes? I am good! Very good!
Getting hard to control strength. Today bit off hand of feeder. Cannot help it so strong.
Hungry. Always hungry. Cannot control. Eat. I must eat am eater must eat...

You found the key? Great, I'll call the others.
It seems the key can be used to operate the lift as well. Up we go.
So this is the observatory.
I didn't expect it to be similar, but this is a far cry from the temple that held Valigarmanda.
All the machinery appears to still be in operation. I expect there are auxiliary systems in place to ensure that monitoring can continue even in emergencies.
The warnings indicate various anomalies─related to the seal's failure, most likely. For a blessing, we managed to fell the beast before it could cause harm.
Right then, let's see if we can find some clues about Gulool Ja's mother.
I think I can use this terminal. Shale taught me how.
There's so much data... I don't know what we should look at.
Perhaps we can narrow down the search by inputting the name Teeshal Ja.
Ah, it brought up a lot of results. They all seem to say the same thing...
“Teeshal Ja, Administrator of Experimental Treatments: Research Logs.”
This sounds good, doesn't it?
Chances are the data is encrypted. And even if not, it will take considerable time to go through it all.
Then let us take it with us to the Backroom and have Shale analyze it.
Agreed.
Alright. I'll transfer it to this storage device I brought.
There, it's finished!
Thank you so much for bringing me all the way here, everyone!
If you're happy, then so am I. Besides, I was able to learn more about my brother as well. It was a fruitful adventure for the both of us.
I admit the tural vidraal gave me a fright at first. But then I remembered who felled the mighty Valigarmanda!
I'll not soon forget our visit to that facility. It was a troubling reminder of the depravity that can arise from the belief that souls are simply a resource to be exploited.
Kiluwsa is really good at driving the hover cargo. I wonder if I can learn how to drive it too...
I'm glad we could find what we sought in that abandoned facility.
It seems safe to say my brother returned to Yuweyawata for the tural vidraal. He wanted its power, no matter the cost...
And here we are. The authorities will doubtless wish to be informed about the facility and its contents...
But first things first: let us deliver the data to Shale.
You heading to the Backroom?
You've found information on Gulool Ja's mother? You lot never cease to amaze...
The data will be in good hands with Shale.
It was Shale who gave me the storage device before we left. She said that we'd probably need it...and we did!
Gulool Ja had no trouble keeping up during the outing. He really is his father's son.
From what I can see, things haven't changed much since the funeral. People are still listless like before.
Having now spent some time in these harsh environs, I feel I have a better understanding of how much of a steadying presence Sphene was to her people.
I've been thinking, it may behoove us to learn how to use the various devices found throughout Alexandria. Better late than never, after all.
Welcome back. Gulool Ja has already given me the storage device.
There looks to be a wealth of data, all of which is encrypted, so I'll need time to process everything.
In that case, Alisaie and I might take ourselves around the city and check on the people.
Aye, their mood has us a bit worried. I don't know if there's anything we can do to help, but we'll see...
Understood. I'll let you know as soon as I've finished my work.
Thank you. We'll see you again soon.
Decrypting files isn't the hard part. It's when the number of digits in a password is unknown that the long nights begin...
I met some members of Oblivion on my way back here. They themselves were returning after having paid their respects to Sphene.
I suspect the Alexandrians' plight reminds Alphinaud and Alisaie of the Garleans'. Little wonder they feel compelled to assist in any way they can.
I share our friends' concern. It's not surprising that the Alexandrians are having difficulty coping with their grief...but still...
I'll stay here with Shale. There's a lot I can learn just from watching her.
Alisaie isn't wrong. The mood out there is still grim.
Some of the Turali remember a time before they were dependent on the soul system, but even they're unsettled and wondering aloud if they'll have the chance to reunite with old friends and family before they pass on.
With good reason, too. The journey home won't be an easy one for those who've grown old.
That's why it's mostly been younger folk who've been leaving for Tural─ones with no elders to care for.
Word of that problem has reached us in Tuliyollal. My brother is doing all he can to see the Xak Tural railroad restored to operation, so that people may come and go more freely.
Unfortunately, the tracks only go as far as Vanguard, so some traveling by foot will still be necessary...
Even so, the railroad would make things a sight easier. How long before it's back in service?
I couldn't say. When I left for this visit, Koana seemed reluctant to make promises...
...But while Shale's working on the data, we could go and see the state of it for ourselves.
To Shaaloani Station, then! I'll make sure to keep Koana informed.
Let us know if there's good news concerning the railroad. We can disseminate it through our network and hopefully put some minds at ease.
Say hello to Koana for me!
I would be astonished if they were able to restore railroad service so quickly. The locomotive was nigh obliterated in its collision with the dome...
Raha and I will keep an eye on things here in your absence.
You'll have plenty of time while I work on this. Trust me.
I've filled Koana in. He asks that we continue to support the Alexandrians as best we can.
Operations are still suspended, but we're trying to remain optimistic. It's good to see you looking well yourselves.
Vow of Resolve! And Forename Surname to boot. What can I do you for?
We're hoping for some good news about the railroad. There's an increasing number of people looking to return to Tural that can't make the journey on foot.
I see. As it happens, the Vow of Reason is also on his way here to take stock of the situation.
...Ah, scratch the “on his way.”
As the guildship has officially approved my transition from gleaner to independent contractor, I was in need of more befitting attire.
<sigh> Stop that. As you well know, my previous attire was that of a gleaner, and I have chosen a different path. It was time for a change.
You're here about the railroad too?
It was in part for my sake that the original Dawnblazer was sacrificed, so I felt it only right that I assist with its replacement.
Speaking of which...
I assume Lamaty'i has explained the growing urgency of the need. What have you to report?
The new locomotive was on track for completion, but we're having difficulty pulling her into the station, in a manner of speaking.
You see, when we used the Dawnblazer to get into the dome, urgency outweighed all other considerations, but now we're back to our original problem: how to run the railroad without upsetting the inhabitants of Mehwahhetsoan.
That is, the rroneek. Though the Hhetsarro that follow them are none too pleased about their hhetso being spooked by the noise of the locomotive, either.
The solution I've devised to quieten the railroad should address that complaint.
But a silent train presents a different danger. The rroneek will need to be deterred from wandering across the tracks.
...And I suppose we can't just blow the whistle at them, or they'll panic and be put off their grazing again.
Weren't the rail routes plotted to avoid the rroneek's preferred grazing areas, though?
It's odd that they're getting so close in the first place...
The rroneek's grazing patterns have shifted since the tracks were laid. I am not certain why, but I intend to ask the people of Mehwahhetsoan for their insight.
As a major proponent of the railroad, I have a duty to assist in this matter, and I too would hear what the Hhetsarro have to say about it. They are the ones most affected, after all.
I believe it would be best to begin by consulting their leader, Hhwato. The rest of you can accompany us to the Hhetsarro encampment if you like.
It's only recently that the rroneek changed their grazing patterns. They didn't stray so close to the tracks before.
For now, we'll continue work on the silent locomotive as planned. Here's hoping that whatever you come up with won't require a total overhaul.
That's Koana, Vow of Reason, is it not? I can scarce believe it...
As committed as the Hhetsarro are to tradition, they are amenable to the unfamiliar...or so I am told.
Our prior visit to the Hhetsarro was also on railroad business. Pray they do not take us for train enthusiasts...
To think all of this can be packed up at a moment's notice to follow wherever the rroneek lead!
Vow of Resolve, Vow of Reason. I bid you welcome to our camp. But what brings you all the way to Mehwahhetsoan?
I thank you for seeing us. Our visit concerns the matter of the Xak Tural railroad...
You too have noted the rroneek's unexpected change in behavior, then.
My son, Shepetto, has been looking into this matter. Shepetto?
Normally, we'd expect the rroneek to keep to their favored grounds nearby for a while yet. And despite a thorough search, we haven't found anything wrong with the quantity or quality of the grazing in Pyariyoanaan and Yawtanane.
Yet they refuse to keep to where they usually would, instead pushing westward, toward your railroad.
I certainly see no cause for this unseasonal migration. Nevertheless, should they continue to move west, we will follow.
...As any true Hhetsarro would, I suppose?
As you may have surmised, I am of Hhetsarro descent. My parents traveled with the rroneek as well, though I myself have no memory of the experience.
I was left behind as a babe, you see, during such a migration. One of many sacrifices necessitated by a nomadic lifestyle, I am forced to assume...
A chance encounter with a kind Pelu merchant was the only reason I survived. Taking pity on me, he taught me his trade that I might fend for myself.
I became a stallkeeper in Tuliyollal's markets, and that is where the Dawnservant found and adopted me.
I had already been in the palace some time when Lamaty'i came to join us.
Like me, she had been cast aside by her parents. I knew the pain of solitude, and wanted to spare her that suffering.
As this tiny child's new brother, I swore: I would always be there for her.
Truly? I have never heard of the rroneek choosing a path so arduous as to force such a terrible decision. Nor of any Hhetsarro willingly leaving their own flesh and blood behind. There must have been some exceptional circumstance...
I cannot say. The idea of following in their footsteps that I might better make excuses for their actions never much appealed to me.
...As is so often the case, you are correct.
Though my discomfort with the Hhetsarro way may arise from fear of reopening old wounds rather than blind fervor for innovation, it would nevertheless see me repeat past mistakes...
And to refuse to learn one of our country's treasured traditions would make me a poor Dawnservant indeed.
Please, teach me of the rroneek, and what they mean to you.
I promise to listen with an open mind.
We would be delighted. In the meantime, your companions are welcome to look around.
Will you learn of Hhetsarro culture with me? I should like to approach this with the fervent curiosity that you and my sister share, but it would be useful to know whether I am, er...doing it correctly.
Then it's settled! You'll learn more of the rroneek, and we'll have a look around the plains. And perhaps, in the process, we'll find the answers we seek.
My knowledge of the culture I was born into is from written accounts alone...and few of them, at that.
It will be a joy to share our traditions with the new Dawnservants, as we once did with Gulool Ja Ja.
The quickest way to learn about our way of life is to do as we do. I hope you're not above manual labor.
I am not the most experienced, I'm ashamed to admit. But I shall put forth every effort.
That's all we ask. Take these tools...
Now, introduce yourself to anyone who looks busy and ask if you can help. They'll be happy to teach you what to do in exchange for another pair of hands to do it!
Let us meet back here later to share what we've learned.
Truth be told, we don't get many visitors keen to learn about our way of life. Anyone around here will tell you whatever you want to know─and then some.
