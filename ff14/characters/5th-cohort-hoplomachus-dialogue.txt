All units, to emergency stations! Do not let the prisoners escape!
This infernal creation is shielded by energies not its own.
Whatever is generating its shield must be near! Find it, Forename!
Ack! There's no end to them!
We labor in vain! Till the beast be divested of its shield, our blows shall not find their mark.
