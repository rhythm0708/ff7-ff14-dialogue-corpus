Not just Dorbei! Now we can continue making cheese! Not that I was worried─it was easier when we were living near that forest, but dung works just as well as wood.
I heard the Mol move from place to place─that the gods tell you where to go. That must be hard on you all...
Hard? I do not understand. Why is it hard?
It is better for the animals to move─to have more food to eat and land to roam. To stay in one place is harder, no?
