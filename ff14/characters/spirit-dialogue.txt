We are the savior.
We are the guardian. The keeper of natural order.
We are the martyr. The bestower of new beginnings.
We are...
Such lofty aspirations! And what sweet irony that the world's saviors will become the agents of its destruction!
It cannot end this way...
We must return and be made whole!
We are the will of the star, now and forever!
For the greater good! For the sake of the world!
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Lies and delusion!
The dead have no power over me. You will be silentâ”€silent as the grave!
No more, we beg of you...
The star must endure...
Believe, and walk in faith. Let the light of your soul shine for all to see.
Not quite the outcome you'd imagined, but a fitting one nonetheless.
Don't you think so, Hades?
