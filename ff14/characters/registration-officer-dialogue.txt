Welcome to the Bureau of Registration. Papers, please.
What have we here...?“Alphinaud, artist. Forename, artist's assistant. To be employed in the service of Lord Chai-Nuzz and Lady Dulia-Chai...”
Yes, everything seems to be in order! Your registration is hereby approved.
I think it best that we deliver you to the Chai residence before─
<sniff> Hm? <sniff> <sniff> Oh dear...
You smell...hideous!
Did you crawl here through a ditch? It's like an unholy miasma of dust and sweat and the musk of some unwashed beast!
Proceed directly to the Delousery next door and scrub yourselves clean. Use whichever showers are free.
After you've rinsed away that stench, you'll want to splash yourselves with this perfume. Liberally.
Once you've made yourself presentable, then you may proceed to the Chai residence. Cornenne, the guard by the stairs, will give you directions.
I hadn't realized we were so...aromatic.

I hadn't realized we were so...aromatic.
Oh, you've showered and dressed already, have you...?
Is it not─ Th-That is to say... Ahem. It seems rather...exposed for one's ablutions, does it not...?
Fine. Just a quick rinse, then...
Good gods... You will mention nothing of this! Swear to me!
...Wouldn't she just. Very well...I shall endeavor to emulate her boldness, then. Courage, Alphinaud!
Well, that was bracing! I believe the lingering smells of the road have been successfully expunged.
Shall we go and present ourselves to our new patrons, then?
