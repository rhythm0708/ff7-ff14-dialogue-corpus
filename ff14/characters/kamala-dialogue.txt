This area is for employees only. Out, out!
What's that? You've come to help!? Oh, praise be to Minduruva!
Kind stranger, I welcome your assistance. On your way here, you passed three storehouses, yes?
I'd like you to carry that small crate to Nahbrifhal, by the storehouse near the hatchery.
The crate of clothing is for Mahnuha...
...And that massive crate there goes to Zeymeira by the middle storehouse. Watch your back with that one.
Those are all the crates we have ready. Once they've been delivered, consider your work here complete!
See those crates in the corner? The lightest one among them─the one with the silks─needs to be brought to Nahbrifhal, by the storehouse near the hatchery.
The crate with the clothing needs to go to Mahnuha in the primary storehouse. The large one there? Zeymeira is waiting on that one by the middle storehouse.
