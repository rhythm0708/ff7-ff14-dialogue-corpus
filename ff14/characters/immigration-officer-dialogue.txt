Welcome to Eulmore, fortunate friends! May I have your names?
I am Alphinaud, an artist, and this is Forename, my assistant.
Ah, yes, I was informed of your imminent arrival. We can forgo the usual interview and begin processing your registration papers forthwith.
Now, the citizens of Eulmore are divided into two classes. There are the “free,” who are blessed with the favor of Lord Vauthry, and the “bonded,” who work in the employ of the free.
You will be joining the ranks of the bonded. Your duties are to serve a patron in the capacity for which you were chosen─in your case, painting pretty pictures.
Should your patron dismiss you for any reason, you must find another sponsor among the free, or accept work as a general laborer.
I see. And might you tell us something of the patron we are to serve?
The two patrons, actually. Chai-Nuzz and Dulia-Chai─a Mystel couple whom most refer to as the “Chais.”
They are both gentle souls, but I would ask that you conduct yourself with respect and humility...for your own sake as much as theirs.
Now. A moment, please, while I complete the relevant paperwork...
All in order. These are your registration documents.
Take those papers next door and submit them to the clerk. Once they've been stamped, you will officially be Eulmoran citizens.
Enjoy your new life in paradise!
