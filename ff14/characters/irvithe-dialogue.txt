Ho there, sinner. Haven't seen you around before. New to Gatetown, I take it. If you need lumber for a shack, you've come to the right place. We can do the building for you too, though that'll cost extra.
...You want lumber to restore the Ladder? Why in the world would anyone want to do that!?
If you don't have the coin, least you could do is come up with a believable excuse!
But look, I'm not one to turn folk away. I'll give you your lumber if you do me a favor in return.
I'd just finished taking stock of our supply and was about to do another round for good measure. I want you to do the counting instead, and we'll see if your total matches mine.
Now, some of the lumber's lying about the yard, but most of it is kept in the storehouse. For these, you can just ask Grithil for the number. Here, I'll lend you some writing material so you can take notes.
