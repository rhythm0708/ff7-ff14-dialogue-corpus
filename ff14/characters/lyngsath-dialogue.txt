If yer fixin' to 'ave one of 'em 'eart-shaped chocolates, ye can pick 'em up from the purveyor 'ere.
I'll 'ave ye know their flavor is as rich as their 'istory. Some 'undreds o' years ago, the Culinarians' Guild was honored by House Valentione with the sole privilege o' baking these 'eart-shaped treats, ye see.
An' there ain't no better time than the season o' ardor an' affection to delight in 'em, is there? They're delectable as they come, so make sure ye get 'em while the gettin's good!
