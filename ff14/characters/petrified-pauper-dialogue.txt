Wh-What do you want from me!? I d-don't know anything, I swear! Please don't kill me!
Just as I told you, wasn't it? The whole lot of them are terrified. <hiccup>
There's been talk of folk getting abducted, but if you ask me, they simply up and moved on to a better place. This place isn't exactly Costa del Sol, if you know what I'm saying.
Welcome back, Forename. Have you learned aught of import?
I see... I suppose I should have expected as much from Ungust. Well, another thought occurred to me in your absence. The commonfolk are nothing if not fervent in their religious beliefs. Perhaps if they speak freely to their gods, then the clergy may know something of use.
If we would know what the commonfolk speak of to their gods, we've no better place to ask than at the Church of Saint Adama Landama. It is a small and humble church, found to the northwest of here.
And so long as you are headed there...might I ask you to deliver this embalmed corpse? A morbid request, I grant you, but it must be borne to burial, and I trust none more than you to see it done.
Seek out a man named Marquesâ”€he tends the graves of the lichyard. He will tell you where the body is to be interred.
