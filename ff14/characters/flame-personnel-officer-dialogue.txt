What brings you to the Hall of Flames this evening, adventurer?
Ah, I thought as much! You are just as our man at the Waking Sands described! It is an honor to meet you, madam!
Is that so? Well then, I must ask you for your name. Ah, but let me guess. It is Forename Surname, is it not? Yes, you are just as our man at the Waking Sands described. Thank you for electing to join us.
Now, in order to formalize your─
Sir!
Speak, Private.
Imperials, sir! They've fired on a Highwind Skyways airship!
Scouts say she's coming down to the west, near Horizon's Edge!
Bloody hells! Of all the times for this to happen!
Forename, there's no time for formalities! The Immortal Flames need your help now!
We're in the midst of a large-scale operation against the Amalj'aa, and we have no one to spare in western Thanalan. You must get to that ship before the Garleans do!
If there are any survivors, see that they do not come to further harm. Now go!
An adventurer? What're you doing out here? No, wait─let's find some cover first...
The Immortal Flames sent you? How do I know you're not an imperial spy? You don't even have a uniform!
