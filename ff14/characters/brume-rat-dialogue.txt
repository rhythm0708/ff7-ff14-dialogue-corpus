I don't know a godsdamned thing about the Mongrel, but if I did, you can be sure I wouldn't tell you!
Not a single shred of information? Just as I expected. These revolutionaries would not have evaded capture for so long without the masses' complicity. Still, it is good to know that Tataru's ears are as sharp as ever.
Frustrating though it may be, we must press on. While I continue speaking with the people of the Brume, why not go and see if Gibrillont knows aught of value?
As the proprietor of the Forgotten Knight, surely he must have heard whispers of the Mongrel before. We can only hope that he will be more forthcoming than the others.
You know, people long for a sympathetic ear, but they need to know that it comes with tight lips.
Discretion, Forenameâ”€that's what my customers expect. If they don't get it, then I don't get them.
That being said, I'm not without my sympathies. I've heard the tales, and I know you've done right by highborn and lowborn alike.
Least I can do is point you in the right direction. But to do that, I'll need you to do something for me.
So happens there's a hunter up in the Crozier who owes me a fair bit of coin. However, I've agreed to accept payment in fresh herbs. Go and get them for me. Agreed?
