Hmmm... I do recall caring for someone until recently. And you say that it was a woman named Namikka?
While I can't say for certain if it was her, I wouldn't worry. I'm sure she's just been taken up to the cloud.
It's not common, but it does happen from time to time.
So it was the same for everyone.
Not a single person remembers Namikka. It's as if the memory of her has been purged from their minds.
While such a thing might be done with magic, to alter the memories of so many at once would be a tremendous undertaking. We would have felt a surge of aether corresponding to the act, too, and I sensed none in that moment.
Neither did I. But I did notice something else─right before Pepoane seemingly forgot, a light in the device on his head began to blink.
Could there be a connection? Someone also said something about “soul cells.”
But who might we ask about this? If we continued making such inquiries, I expect we would only cause confusion.
Indeed... If we can't readily solve the mystery about Namikka, perhaps we could search for Cahciua instead?
Sphene said to try the Thunderyards.
It should be in this direction.
