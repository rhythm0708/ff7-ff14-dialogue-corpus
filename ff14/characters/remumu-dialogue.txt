Excuse me, miss. Do you have a moment? I'm Remumu, with the Harbor Herald, and judging by your dress, you're one of those well-traveled adventurers I've heard so much about.
No doubt one as worldly as yourself has heard the rumors. Of an unusual warrior maiden from the Far East? Danger constantly follows in her footsteps, and the Far Easterners I've spoken with claim her dress and fighting style are nothing they've ever seen.
Do you know what happened the last time a strange warrior from unknown lands came to Eorzea? That upstart Petyr Winsome practically stole the parchment from my desk to write his story. Our readership soon doubled, and he's been regarded as the Harbor Herald's finest reporter ever since.
That should have been my story, and I'll be damned if he beats me to this one! But if following her is as dangerous as it sounds, I'll need an adventurer like you to keep me safe. If you're interested, meet me down at Costa del Sol. That's where she was last spotted, so that's where I plan to start.
I hope to see you at Costa del Sol, miss. If all goes as planned, I'll have a real story to finally put Petyr Winsome in his place.
Ah, you're here at last! I was beginning to think you wouldn't come. She was here just a few bells ago, or so I was told.
Look, over there. Could it be...?
