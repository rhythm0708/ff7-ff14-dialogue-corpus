The Lightwarden? No, I have not seen it.
But I have witnessed the horrors of the lesser eaters. How they are wont to hunt in packs and carry off their victims rather than consuming them on the spot.
I suspect the Warden is a grotesque, corpulent thing, waiting patiently for its minions to bring its next meal.
