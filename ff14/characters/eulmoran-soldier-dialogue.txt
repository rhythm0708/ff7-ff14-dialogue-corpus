Keep moving!
Eh? What now?
The Crystarium at a guess.
Desperate fools. It'll take more than a handful of overgrown lizards to ground us!
Oh, you've got to be─ Sound the alarum!
Captain, the powder has taken effect!
It is time. Let us free the Oracle from their clutches!
The first contingent has already entered. Let us follow.
There you are, Forename! Mayhap you could lend us a hand!
Reinforcements! We need reinforcements!
My men will occupy the enemy while we rescue the Oracle.
Come, we keep close to the wall!
They're here too! To arms, to arms!
Damn it. Let's make this quick!
You certainly took your time. Let's cut a path through this rabble and keep moving!
Your zeal is admirable, Sister, but we were told to avoid enemy attention, not invite it!
We do not have time. Leave them to the guard.
Eulmore may boast the world's largest army...
But woman for woman, we are no less mighty!
Intruders! Stop them!
Gah, not again!
Crystarium scum!
This is no token force. They were serious about invading.
If you can stand, you can fight! Push them back!
There are more still standing than I would have liked...
But we must press on regardless. The longer we take, the harder our task will become.
We don't seem to be getting anywhere...
Forename, Lyna─go on ahead! We'll hold them here!
Understood. With me, Forename!
The way is relatively clear. Good.
There she is!
Quickly─free her!
Th-Thank you. Are you...from the Crystarium?
Correct. We've come to rescue you.
Your weapons─made to the same specifications as Thancred's.
Be ready to use them.
U-Understood. Please lead the way.
Let's rejoin the others and quit this place.
All this trouble because of me... I'm so sorry...
Save your apologies until after we've escaped.
It's quiet. Too quiet.
Is that...Ran'jit!? This will not end well...
Hmph, brazen thieves.
You will regret coming here.
You will return to Eulmore.
N-No! I won't go back to that cell!
It is for your own protection.
Ah!
Pathetic.
Are you all right!?
I-I'm fine... I just...can't move...
Stay there while I tend to these vermin.
The tales do not lie. He is fierce beyond reckoning. We are outmatched!
He cannot maintain this onslaught forever! Be prepared to run!
You will do no such thing.
And now it is just you and me.
Ungh... Be careful, Forename!
You are made of sterner stuff than the rest.
But will it be enough...?
Gukumatz, do my bidding!
It seems you are no ordinary soldier.
You are persistent, that I will allow.
I have your measure now. The game is up.
Know your folly.
You, boy. You bear a striking resemblance to the artist my master seeks.
By all means, keep your counsel. You will all have ample time to confess your crimes back in Eulmore.
Thancred?
So! You are the wretch who stole her from us...
And what if I am!?
