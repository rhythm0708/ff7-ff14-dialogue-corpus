Thal's balls, my ankle is on fire! Caught my boot on a rock or something and twisted it as I fell.
The others went on ahead through Daniffen Pass. Hurry and you might catch up.
If you aren't sure where to go, look for tracks. This snow is fresh, so they shouldn't be hard to find.

Scion! What are you doing here!?
The heretics? I-I'm not sure. There was a great scaled beast, and... <cough> <cough> ...Yuyuhase? I think... I think he went east on his own. The heretics split up, so we did too.
How embarrassing─I was so intent on following the heretics' tracks that I almost failed to notice they had doubled back. Almost, mind you─one tried to sneak up behind me and got a knife in the gut for his troubles.
I thought myself alone, so I started searching the dead man's knapsack for anything of interest. And lo and behold, before his friends found me, I came upon this.
“Withdraw in groups of three or less to the Observatorium. Give the signal and wait─the merchant will be watching. Be late and be left for dead.”
Speaks for itself, does it not? They can't possibly mean to rendezvous inside the place, so we should restrict our search to the surrounding areas.
Let me rephrase that: you should restrict your search to the wilderness around the Observatorium. I will need more than a moment's rest to recover from these wounds.
I am through with listening to your excuses! We leave now!
