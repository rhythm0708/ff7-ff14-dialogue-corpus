Your face is unknown to me. What business have you at my rookery?
...Hmph. Signed by the Exarch, no less.
Yes, I can provide you with an amaro for passage to Kholusia. I will pick you out a friendly whelp.
That's right. Mounts like my grey friend over there are a common sight in these parts.
But I gather you hail from further afield. More accustomed to chocobos, perchance? I hear there are a few places where they ride little else.
A chocobo? Do you hail from one of Norvrandt's more isolated settlements, perchance? I hear there are a few places where they ride little else.
But here in the Crystarium, mounts like that grey fellow there are far more commonly used.
...Hm. Seeing as you are plainly unaccustomed to riding amaro, I think it best I accompany you on this flight myself.
Any Zun worthy of the name could do it, of course, but the Exarch sent you to me. Ensuring you arrive safely is my responsibility.
Gather your things and meet me at the Amaro Launch. One of the junior tamers will attend to you while I ready the mounts.
