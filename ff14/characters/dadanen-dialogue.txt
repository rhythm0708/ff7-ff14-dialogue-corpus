Forename, I presume? Aye, Momodi said to expect you, and so I have.
Welcome to Horizon. Ours is a trading settlement that sees goods in from the port of Vesper Bay to the west─and trade we do. Nary a day goes by that Horizon isn't bustling with some manner of merchants and officials.
They keep us running about busy, they do. Enough so that I wish I had chocobo legs in place of my own. And that's why I've asked Momodi to send me any souls looking for work.
Twelve know there is plenty of it to be done around here. Speak to me again when you are ready to make yourself of some use.
It so happens that I've a situation that must be resolved posthaste─and I do mean posthaste.
I'm plumb out of premium product, and my latest order has yet to arrive! If I keep my customers waiting any longer, this could irrevocably damage my reputation!
What's worse, I paid my man in advance for his services. Despite his assurances that it would be a simple affair, I've heard nothing since he departed for Copperbell Mines days ago.
Find Drunken Stag and give him this notice. I cannot afford any further delay.
