Western front, clear! Eastern front, clear!
For me? From Papashan? A twilight pretzel... My favorite! How did he know!?
Can't fight on an empty stomach, now, can I? Actually...I can't fight on any stomach. I suppose you could say I have no stomach...for fighting.
You've returned─and with a deal fewer pretzels, I see! Tell me, how fare our Sultansworn sentries? Did they have anything to report, anything at all!?
What? Nothing? Are you sure? I...oh, oh dear.
Take this for your troubles, then. And stay a moment─there is more I would ask of you.
Forename, I have just this moment─ No! No, the time for concealment is past! The truth is, even before I had you deliver those pretzels, I was privy to some most unsettling news!
...Which is the real reason I sent you to meet those Sultansworn.
A young noblewoman from a very prestigious family has run away from home, and I have been ordered to see to her safe return.
The Sultansworn you met earlier are assisting with the search. Alas, it seems they have found no trace of her.
I apologize for not being frank with you from the start, but we must proceed with caution─should word of her disappearance spread, I fear others with less honorable motives may join the hunt.
And should we allow her to come to any harm, not even a hundred beheadings would be punishment enough...
That cannot happen, Forename. It must not!
I need you to help me find her!
Praise the Twelve, I knew I could count on you!
I've instructed the others to expand the search, but Thanalan is vast and there are only so many of us.
The young noblewoman's name is Lady Lilira. I want you to go south and look for her in the vicinity of the Sultantree. Good luck!
