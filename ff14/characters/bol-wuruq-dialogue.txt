Ah, it is a pleasure as always, Forename. Have you been able to relax lately?
Wonderful. As busy as you have been, with the rite of succession among other things, you deserve an opportunity to experience Tuliyollal at a more leisurely pace.
Sampling the tacos at Xbalyav Ty'e is one such way to do so. They're made the traditional way and laden with fillings, and are absolutely sublime! If you have an empty stomach, the owner, Br'uk Evu, will look after you!
Ahhh, talking about the tacos at Xbalyav Ty'e has given me a craving... If you have time and an empty stomach, do go and have some for me!
Well, if it isn't Forename! Alone today, are you?
I see, I see. If you have a hankering for tacos, then they're on the house. Consider it thanks for everything you've done for Tuliyollal.

Go ahead and find a table. I'll bring you your meal as soon as it's ready.
Your red-haired friend has become something of a regular. Rare is the day he won't take one with him on a morning stroll.
