Ahhhg...
Grrruuugh!

If the source of our failures thus far has been the inability of our bodies to contain feral souls, what if we were to reverse the process? By purging a beast of its memories and infusing it with a man's soul─one still possessed of its own memories─we stand to gain absolute control over a vessel of great power. My subordinate, who first proposed this brilliant hypothesis, shall have the honor of being the first to transcend our meager limits. I must prepare his soul for extraction at once!
I have a bad feeling about this...
There's something unsettling about the aether here.
What happened to them?
