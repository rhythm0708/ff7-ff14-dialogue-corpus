Hm? Oh, this will be my first visit to Tural.
Fonjeantaine's the name. I was working at Eshtaime's Aesthetics in Ul'dah, you see, but my employment with them, uh...came to an end.
That's why I visited Sharlayan, in the hopes of starting over. While I was attempting─and failing─to find a new job, I seized the chance to board this vessel when I overheard room for another passenger had suddenly opened up.
I'm told the Dawnservant welcomes all regardless of origin, and so Tuliyollal seemed like the perfect place to begin anew.
Hopefully things will be better this time...
I wonder what the city will be like...
