Have you ever gazed at the skies above and contemplated the mysteries contained therein? I speak not of shifting cloud patterns, but of the vastness beyondâ”€of the sun and the twinkling tapestry of the night.
Some think the dome above us to be a finite space, yet amongst the leading thinkers of our age, one scholar's depiction of a boundless sea of stars has firmly taken root.

...Having read of their ancient ambitions, I wonder: has your interest in this field of study waxed or waned?
What if I were to tell you that the eternal constellations were arranged differently in the distant past? That their positions continue to shift almost imperceptibly but measurably as we journey into the future?
Would it shock you to learn that the stars drift further and further apart, and may indeed do so forever? Are you eager to learn more?
