Ah, Mistress Surname. I do not believe I have properly introduced myself. My name is Honoroit, and I serve at the pleasure of Lord Emmanellain.
...Lady Laniaitte would have me accompany Lord Emmanellain on his mission!?
Ah, I understand completely. I will do my utmost to keep him out of harm's way.
Were he of another house, mayhap I would not feel obligated to go to such lengths to preserve his safety and dignity...
In any case, I appreciate you speaking to him for me. It would seem he actually listens to you─at least, more so than others.
Or mayhap you are more skilled at this than most. Aye, I suspect you have had to humor your fair share of difficult men before.
Now that Emmanellain is out of harm's way, we are free to discuss matters of actual import, such as our struggles with the Vanu Vanu.
We first encountered the Vanu several years ago, when we had just begun to explore the Sea of Clouds. After an exchange of pleasantries and gifts, we received permission to construct a permanent lookout post.
There was peace between our peoples for half a year, until suddenly, for reasons unknown, their attitudes towards us changed. They began to attack our foraging parties without provocation, forcing us to rely more heavily on supplies flown in from Ishgard.
...But words are no substitute for firsthand experience. Go and see Ser Marielle─she could use your assistance.
