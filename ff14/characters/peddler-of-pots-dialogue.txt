No, no, you want my goods, newcomer! I have jars and pots, all smooth and shiny!
Over here!
Come and look!
You buy, you buy?
Enough of that! Calm, I say!
This one must still journey through the barrens. Nothing bulky! Nothing heavy! No pots!
Nothing better for the road than a full belly. Spend that piece at Rhon Ron's place, yes? Eat for three before you leave!
