You're here about Commodore Reyner's investigation? Then you'll want to board a ferry bound for Aleport.
Once you arrive in western La Noscea, though, you'd best pay a visit to the Hall of the Novice before you blunder into Sastasha.
The Adventurers' Guild runs the Hall, and the folk there will prepare youâ”€train you with the skills you'll need to face the dangers undoubtedly waiting for you in the Seagrot.
The Hall is on the way to Sastasha, just north of Aleport. Head inside and one of their seasoned adventurers will take you in hand. Best of luck to you, friend!
No matter what they've told you, be ready for pirates. There's never any shortage of the bastards. This is Limsa Lominsa we're talking about...
