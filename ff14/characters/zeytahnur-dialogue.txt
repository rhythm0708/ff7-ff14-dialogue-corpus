Is something the matter, traveler? If you are lost, perhaps I could be of assistance.
Your offer is most appreciated. We are not lost, but we are in need of information. Might you know anything about the gargantuan beast that rampaged through the bazaar?
Aye, I saw it all. Though I wish I had not.
I was going about my work, when all of a sudden a piercing scream cut through the air. I turned around, and there was the fiend, its massive body bursting through that entryway with the force of a tidal wave. And then it was gone, as quickly as it came...
That is the extent of what we will learn here, I think. Shall we take a moment to consider our findings elsewhere?
Fortunate was I to be inside my shop at the time. The owner of the stall across from me was hawking his wares on the street. Suffice it to say, he wasn't so lucky...
It might distress those still traumatized by the incident to discuss what we've learned within earshot...
Judging by their accounts, the transformation had already occurred by the time the beast reached the bazaar.
It tore through the west side of the bazaar and headed towards the aetheryte plaza...
In other words, the blasphemy may have first appeared in this vicinity. That being the case, the people in that meyhane can surely tell us more.
You could see the terror in the eyes of those poor merchants. Would that we could do something to allay their fears...
