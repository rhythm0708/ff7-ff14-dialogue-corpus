I too was there that terrible day. My friend was transformed into a sin eater before my very eyes, and I had no choice but to cut her down. The thought of returning to the field, of holding a blade againâ”€it filled me with dread.
But that is no way to honor her or my comrades. And so I have returned! I swear I will not let you or anyone else down from this day forward.
