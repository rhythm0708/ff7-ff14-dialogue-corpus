If I may ask, chosen one, what are your plans for Tuliyollal after you take the throne?
Plans? What makes you think we care about all that?
We care only about the contest, and proving our superiority.
That would surely please Mother and Father.
Yes, and when we become Dawnservant, we'll drive out the weakling masses and invite our kin to live in the city.
Oho, a fine idea! Our family deserves better than that rotten jungle!
Back to it, then! We must catch up to that one-headed pretender and remind him of the natural order!
