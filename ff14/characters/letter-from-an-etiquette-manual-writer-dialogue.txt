One lazy afternoon, as I stood by the aetheryte plaza, I found myself absorbed by the sight of adventurers whiling away their time.
Greeting friends who were passing by, practicing a newly learned dance, sitting on a bench and chatting...
Opening umbrellas when it began to rain, tucking into a loaf of bread when peckish... To the untrained eye, they were doing naught out of the ordinary. I, however, saw the fruits of my life's workâ”€and it warmed my heart.
Dreaming of a day when proper social etiquette is practiced by all, be it in a ballroom or otherwise, I shall continue my quest to edify.Courteously yours,An Etiquette Manual Writer
