SLAVES NO MORE! FREE! FREEEEEE!
MASTERS MUST PAY! MASTERS MUST DIE!
NEVER AGAIN! NEVER!
Ah, the conqueror of Copperbell returns!
Thanks to you, our minin' operations can resume, and Ul'dah will have the materials she needs to rebuild. The entire nation's in your debt, friend.
I'll share the good tidin's with Papashan the next time I see him. As for you, you'll want to report to Momodi. It'll do the woman well to see you alive and in one piece.
