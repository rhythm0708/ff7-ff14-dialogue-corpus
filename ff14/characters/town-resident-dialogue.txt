The queen is come!
You look well, Pakwene.
And Ketonye, I see you've already taken to your new position.
When she introduced herself as queen, I was expecting someone...colder. Honestly, she reminds me of you, Lamaty'i.
Me?
It's only natural for a ruler to love her people.
And I should like to know them as best I canâ”€even the most trifling details.
The more you come to know them, the more you grow to love them. Who they are, and what they've built.
That's it! Beautifully put.
And it would appear that she is well loved in turn...
