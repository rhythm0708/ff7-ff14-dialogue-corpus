Poor, poor thing.
Who said that? Show yourselves!
Come now, put away that frown and have some fun with us!
Yes, let us have some fun.
Lots and lots of fun!
Ugh, which way was it to Urianger's?
We've been there so many times, but I'm not... I can't...
Why can't I remember?
Damn it all. We're already caught in their spell!
Il Mheg is the faerie kingdom, and as one might expect, it is home to the fae folk.
The most prominent among them are the pixies, who have a penchant for making mischief. They use powerful illusions to play tricks on all who venture into their domain.
By way of an example, they can make a familiar path seem wholly unfamiliar, or lead you to believe you're somewhere you're not.
And we are now, I am sorry to say, entirely at their mercy.
As it stands, we cannot hope to find the way to Urianger. For that, we must convince the pixies to lift the spell.
From what I could make of the voices, the creatures want to play with us. If that is the case, they should permit us to find their village─Lydha Lran.
Come. I have a sneaking suspicion this path will lead us directly into their midst.
Oh, and I should mention that Minfilia has been informed of our situation. Of the different worlds and our mission. You may consider her an ally.
Well, here we are. Yet the pixies are nowhere to be seen. Knowing them, their games have already begun. In which case...
Forename─there is a variety of plant native to these parts with a distinctive furled tip.
"Looking grass“ is its name─so called because it can be used to spy pixies, believe it or not. I'll...explain how I know all of this later, but first, I need you to help me find some.
Oh─if a voice calls to you, under no circumstances should you respond. You will only subject yourself to further mischief.
