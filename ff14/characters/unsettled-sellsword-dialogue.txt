Help! For gods' sakes!
Hear my tale, I beg you! A group of us were surveying ancient ruins when we stumbled into Gnath territory. The creatures took us captive─I was the only one who managed to flee.
Tell me, is the leader of your party a man named Sylviel?
H-How did you know? But yes, I'm his hired sword. I ran back to Tailfeather as swiftly as my legs could carry me, but no one here is willing to help us.
And why the hells not?
Going into Gnath territory is tantamount to suicide. They warned us, but we ignored them, thinking we could manage. How wrong we were...
There're people in need, Forename. Are we going to ignore their plight? Or are we going to lend them our aid?
Heh, that was just a rhetorical question, but thanks for humoring me all the same! Aye, we'll go and rescue these people, and I'm sure you'd be no less enthused even if Sylviel weren't among them!
As for you, friend─while we're off saving your employer's arse, I want you to tell the craven bastards here they're a bunch of craven bloody bastards!
Needless to say, I am coming as well. Let us begin by scouting the entrance to Loth ast Gnath.
This man is Sylviel's assistant. He managed to win free, but Sylviel is still being held within. Let us go and extricate him!
Guydelot and I will draw them away! Please tend to Master Sylviel!
