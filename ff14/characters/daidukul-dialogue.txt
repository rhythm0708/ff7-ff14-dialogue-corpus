This one carries the fire. The Buduga would take his measure.
Seek my comrade outside tending to the stores. He will give you your task. You will know him by his clothâ”€unlike they of the yellow, we are of the green.
I, for one, would welcome the opportunity to learn more of the Buduga and their ways. It would be an honor!
...We shall speak of your task outside. With me.
Your name, foreigner?
...Forename, then. You are to dive into Azim Khaat, below the Dawn Throne, and gather swordgrass from the lakebed.
It is an invaluable ingredient in many medicines. Eight bundles will you bring.
You will need to dive deep to obtain that which you seek...but that shall pose no trouble for a true warrior, no?
Some say that the dominion of the Dawn Father and the Dusk Mother does not extend beneath the water. But ours does. Indeed, the Oronir fear naught above nor below.
Speak with the guard to descend. We shall speak again when you have finished.
