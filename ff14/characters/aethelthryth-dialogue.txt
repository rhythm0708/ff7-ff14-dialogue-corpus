Haven't seen anything like that, but it seems too coincidental that there was talk in Gridania recently about an unnatural being that was disturbing the elementals.
The Padjals were saying they've never seen a spirit like it, and feared it would taint the Twelveswood. Seedseer O-App-Pesi himself sealed it away near the Guardian Tree.
The Padjals said O-App-Pesi actually struggled to contain the thing, despite being well versed in unnatural phenomena in the forest. What was the word they used to describe it? Slippery?
