A true knave! You betray even yourself, Sevrin.
Ugh...
We were prepared to overlook the matter of your desertion on the condition that you provided us with suitable replacements. That was the agreement.
Yet your latest change of heart leaves your debt to us unpaid.Few are they who betray the Serpent Reavers twice. You will not do so a third time.
Cowering behind your protector will only delay the inevitable. Honorless wretch...your life is all you have left.
And worthless though it be, we shall take it!
