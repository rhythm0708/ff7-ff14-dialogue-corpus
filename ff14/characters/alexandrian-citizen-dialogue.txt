Come on, let's go and see the princess!
R-Right... Oh gods, I'm so nervous...
<sigh> Will there ever be peace again?
We're short on just about everything because of this war...
Have you heard? Princess Sphene is here!
The people really did love her.
The princess's airship is coming to Victors' March!
Even with all her duties, she makes time for us.
She was goodness personified.
Oh, to get just a glimpse of her!
It's the princess!
