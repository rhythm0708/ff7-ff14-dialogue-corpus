The Colony: Many years ago, on the banks of the Thaliak in the Dravanian hinterlands, a Sharlayan colony once thrived.
The Colony: This settlement was originally established as a mere outpost to study the aetherial sea in the year 1311 of the Sixth Astral Era.
The Colony: Scholars dispatched to Eorzea found the facilities wanting, and their demands encouraged a gradual expansion in structures and services.
The Colony: As rumors spread of a growing community of academics, the area was further inundated with Eorzean students hoping to share in the renowned wisdom of the Sharlayans.
The Colony: Fifty years later, the Forum passed a motion to recognize what had become a flourishing town as an official Sharlayan colony.
The Colony: Eorzean residents took to calling the colony itself “Sharlayan,” which led to no small amount of confusion when discussions turned to the subject of the motherland.
The Colony: In response, some Sharlayan inhabitants, if pressed for a name, would simply refer to it as “Emporium.”
The Colony: Following the exodus, however, goblins and treasure hunters claimed for themselves a corner of the abandoned colony and gave it yet another name: Idyllshire.
