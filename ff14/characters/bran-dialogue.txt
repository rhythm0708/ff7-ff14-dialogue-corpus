Something I can do for you, adventurer? If you've business with Bran, best state it quickly. This gaz has leads to follow and incidents to investigate for the Harbor Herald.
Well, slap me silly with a harbor herring! If it isn't the adventurer who gave this gaz a story for the ages by bringin' that letter in a bottle way back when.

I see... With apologies, I haven't seen this Nhagi. As a matter of fact, I've been rather busy workin' on my upcomin' piece on the Rising.
Why, just earlier I was interviewin' the ever-enigmatic wandering minstrel, who's got another unusual venture in the offin'. The letter forest, he calls it.
If that piques your interest, I recommend you go and see the man. He's at the Gold Court, over on the Steps of Thal.
