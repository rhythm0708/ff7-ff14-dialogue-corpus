Hello! Yes, I am Moghan─the foremost alchemist in Moghome, if you must know!
If your tummy's gloopy or your wings're droopy, I've a potion to fix that!
Or, I would if I didn't keep running out of ingredients. Luckily, you're here to do my chore─ Er, trial! Yes! Go forth, mighty adventurer, and mightily pluck three sprigs of cloudsbreath for me!
You'll find it blooming near the entrance to Eil Tohm. It's not the safest of places, so don't let yourself be too distracted by the pretty flowers, kupo!
Did you have any trouble finding cloudsbreath? I do need it quite urgently, you know...
Oh, yes, these are perfect, kupo! Now I have the main ingredient for my pom tonic.
...Speaking of which, how are you feeling, miss? Should you ever feel your pom losing its bounce, then I'm your moogle, kupo!
