We need only hold out a little while longer.
Reinforcements are coming, remember? The captain said so. We're going to be all right...
Run! Run, damn you!
The Warrior of Darkness has returned. The bloody night has returned! So stay with me, eh? You can't go dying now!
Godsdammit! Please let this work, please let this work...
No! N-No, stay back! Stay back!
Help, help! Someone, anyone!
Why did you spare me? Why? What have I done to deserve this mercy!?
