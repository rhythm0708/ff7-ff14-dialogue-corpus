Mistress Surname, I presume? Lady Laniaitte told me you were coming.
I hear tell you've never faced a Vanu before? Well, spend enough time on patrol and you're sure to cross paths with them eventually.
These birdmen are native to the floating isles. I say “birdmen,” but they're not at all like the Ixal─unless that Ixal's mother was a gigas.
Here, let me mark several locations on your map. If you discover any Vanu in these areas, kill or drive them away.

Finished with your patrol? Anything to report?
Heh, maybe it was too much to hope for a day without a skirmish. At least I can take solace in the fact that Halone has blessed us with a mighty ally.
Excepting your recent clashes with the Vanu, it cannot have escaped your notice that things here are rather peaceful─to the detriment of our garrison's discipline.
Despite being built as an observation post, we have yet to record a single intrusion by the Horde. That is why, as far as everyone is concerned, Camp Cloudtop is a backwater of no significance.
And of course, the pride of our camp, the vaunted Protector, is in a perpetual state of needing repairs, so even were the Holy See to come under Dravanian attack, we would be unable to fly to their aid.
Simply put, Mistress Surname, this is where ambition comes to die. If you haven't aspirations for advancement, you'll be right at home.
However, I would like to think that enthusiasm can be just as contagious as apathy. If you'll indulge me, I would have you seek out the sentries and stoke their fighting spirit─psych them up, you might say.
