You're looking to present yourselves to the Chais, are you? Let me explain how the city's laid out, then. Imagine three layers, one on top of the other...
This layer here is called the Buttress. Above us is the Understory, where the military has its headquarters. And above that, you've got the Canopy, which is where the free citizens of Eulmore spend their days.
So if you want to find your new patrons, you'll need to keep climbing until you run out of stairs, then look for the “Grand Dame's Parlor.” They'll be in there, like as not.
