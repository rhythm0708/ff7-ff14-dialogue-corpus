Well now, I don't believe I've seen you around before. A newcomer, I take it?
It's wonderful here, let me tell you! Why, I just bumped into a dear friend in life, and we've been whiling away the hours reminiscing.
It might have been more like days, actually. You don't get a sense of the time here.
By the way, did you hear the announcement earlier? As much as I love this place, I wonder if Queen Sphene can really sustain us forever...
But I suppose there's no use worrying about such things. Anyway, thanks to you, we found a break in our conversation. We'll go and ride the gondola next!
