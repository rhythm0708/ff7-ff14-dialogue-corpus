You've been busy, haven't you? And now you're here to ask if I need help with anything? Heh, now that you mention it...
Lately we've had trouble with ravenous sharks that've been leaping out of the water and making off with our fish. Damndest thing, I know, but you wouldn't doubt it if you saw it.
We've got to cull the thieving bastards regularlyâ”€so happens I sent three of my mates out there before you came along. Still, the more the merrier. If you can kill two or so, that ought to be enough.
Take a few of those rotting fish as bait. I'll not be needing them. Oh, and maybe see if you can't find the other group. They've been away longer than I like.
