Hmph. Bloody waste of... Come on, then! You wanted this, remember!?
I've had enough of your tricks!
Forename! Alphinaud's in trouble!
Ha! A fine champion you are!
You have been indulged enough, heathen swine!
Forename, Alphinaud! Look out!
This isn't—funny.
Th-They... I mean, WE WON!
The Fury has spoken!
Alphinaud Leveilleur, Tataru Taru─you are hereby acquitted of all charges.
Blessed are we who receive of Her wisdom and see justice wrought by Her divine hand! Petitioners, accused─go forth in peace!
Delivered from an untimely demise yet again. My thanks...as always.
By the Fury, what a splendid victory! To see how you strove in the face of adversity─two brave young souls bound together by the puissant bonds of camaraderie...! Why, it stirred me to the very depths of my soul!
Having been treated to such a rousing spectacle, it seems only right that I present you with a humble token of mine admiration. Pray receive of me this chocobo whistle.
With it, you may summon a black chocobo─fully trained and ready to fly!
Magnificent, is she not? Strong yet sleek, elegant yet eager! What say you, Forename─will you take her for your steed?
