A girl with an oddly dressed chocobo chick? She passed by here just earlier.
She looked a little lost, so I asked her if she needed help, but she told me she was fine─that she was heading to the Agelyss River. Though I left it at that, I can't help but worry for her, out there on her own. I hope you find her soon.

The little girl said that she was heading to the Agelyss River. I hope you find her soon.
There you are! By your triumphant expression, dare I hope you've learned something of the little girl and our mascot?
So the girl, Sibly, was headed for the Agelyss River? That you should find just the information we need is auspicious indeed!
For my part, in the course of speaking with the locals, I was able to learn more about dragons. That is, while they have many similarities with the ryu of the Far East, they are in fact different creatures.
I had been under the impression that they were one and the same, but be it their folklore or their status in mortal society, they are quite distinct.
I had assumed that the people of Eorzea were like me─that they thought the ryu was simply a dragon by another name.
I suppose it is little wonder that Sibly looked so puzzled during our first encounter... When next we find her, I shall do my utmost to explain the true meaning of our mascot. Now, off to the Agelyss River with us!
