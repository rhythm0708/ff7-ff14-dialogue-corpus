Ye say a Yellowjacket sent ye here? Eh? Me light's grown dim, has it? Well, o' course it bloody has!
The bomb what fuels me furnace has up an' buggered off, ye see. If I don't get that beacon fixed up soon, there'll be trouble on the water...
I know yer just the messenger, lass, but I can tell a 'venturer when I see one. I'm goin' to need ye to chase down that bomb an' bring back a claw what ye ripped from its smolderin' corpse.
Take this here iron brazier an' set her down in the middle o' the Flockâ”€somewhere near the scarecrow, I'd say. Ye get a nice fire goin', an' that frisky bomb'll soon be about. Watch ye don't singe yer eyebrows, lass.
All ye need do is take down that runaway bomb an' bring me one of its little claws.
Ah, ye got the ashy bastard, did ye? Once I put this little firecracker in the furnace, that should keep things runnin' for a while.
I had meself a bit of a look while ye was gone, an' Llymlaen curse me if the furnace weren't all bent an' broken. Small wonder the bloody bomb was able to escape.
I patched things up as best I could, but I ain't no smitty. Ye might want to have a chat with that Yellowjacket friend o' yers in Swiftperch, an' have him pass the word back to someone in Limsa.
The furnace is damaged, is it? Very well, I shall write up the relevant reports, but these repairs must needs be effected without delay.
It seems I have another favor to ask of you, adventurer. Take yourself straightway to the Armorers' Guild in Limsa Lominsa and explain the situation to Forgemaster H'naanza.
