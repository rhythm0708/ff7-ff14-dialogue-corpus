Hey, adventurer! Mind runnin' a message to Crescent Cove for us?
Captain Baldewyn's plannin' some festivities for the thaumaturges, see, and he wants 'em treated to the finest food and drink. Nothin' but the best for our distinguished guests, eh?
Head west and south to the village and tell Raffe that he's to deliver a bounty of fresh fish to Horizon for the feast.
