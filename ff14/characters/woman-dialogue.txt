Hahaha!
Treat me like a child, will you!? My friends haven't done anything wrong, damn it! They've been framed!
Stubborn little runt...
Listen here, Zekowa. If you want to be treated like an adult, then you'd best comport yourself like one. That means respecting the rule of law.
Order may be precarious here in Shaaloani, but it can be had if each man does the right thing. And for those that don't, wellâ”€they have to answer to the Dustwatch.
Now run along, and think before you cast aspersions next time.
Lest you hurt my feelings.
Fine... If that's how it's gonna be...
I wouldn't if I were you.
Is that...?
There's a time to fight and a time to withdraw. For you, that's now.
What?
