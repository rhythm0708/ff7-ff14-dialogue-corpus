Argh, how could I have lost? My strategy was foolproof! Listen, friend, if you have an inclination towards that Lord of Verminion game at the Gold Saucer, I'd say you'd best think twice.
I spent a fortune on my critters, and had scores of victories to boast. Then some newcomer waltzed up and challenged me. I knew there was something strange about him─an Au Ra with hair of vibrant hue, glint in his eye, called himself the “maundering executive” or some such.
Still, I'm not one to turn down a match, novice or veteran. Hells, I even gave him a head start. But the minions he used, they weren't like any I've ever seen before! They were demons, I tell you!
I accused him of cheating, but he said he had petitioned the Gold Saucer to use them for battle...and the little buggers were approved! Needless to say, my beloved team was torn to shreds every time.
Seems like anything qualifies these days. I've completely lost my appetite for the game, but if you're curious about these so-called minions, you should head over to the Gold Saucer and take a look yourself. He was still loitering around there when I left.
...That blank stare tells me you have no idea what I've been rambling on about. I'd give you a ticket if I had a spare. Hmmm... My well-heeled brother tends to flaunt his winnings around here, and he usually has more than a few on hand. See if he can't help you out.
And that red monstrosity... I've never seen a cat like it. Where in the seven hells did he get it?
