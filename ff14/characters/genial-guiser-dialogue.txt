Preparations for the marvelous masquerade are presently underway, but do come back soon!
You are returned, and that means Gridania is free of mischievous voidsent. Heh heh...let us hear what Papa Gruff has to say.
There you are. I took care of the voidsent still haunting the Greatloam Groweryâ”€did your hunt go as smoothly?
Good, good! Now we can safely say that the only frights in store for the citizens of Gridania are of the decidedly entertaining variety.
I took the liberty of gathering the pumpkins you created. Their punishment will not be eternal, but they can stand to remain in their current form for the duration of the festivities. It is the least they can do in repentance...heh heh heh.
There you are, my fearless clown! Thank you for reassuring me. I had worried I might have to retire from my position at the Greatloam Growery and seek less haunted climates.
