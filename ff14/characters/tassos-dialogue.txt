You seem eager to go, but what about your friend there?
What is this “fun place” meant to be? Is Cahciua there?
Well, I suppose there's only one way to find out...
Come on, let's talk to this Tassos fellow.
This area's normally off-limits, but Cahciua's told us about you.
Just follow the corridor, and head into the room at the end.
Let's go, Forename. Whatever happens, you won't catch me being surprised!
Wonderful, they're here.
We've only just arrived ourselves.
Amazing...
I bid you welcome to the Backroom, Oblivion's humble headquarters.
A hideout tucked behind a drinking hole... Brings back memories, doesn't it?
Our members here are mainly creators and adapters─that is, scientists and engineers who specialize in electrope.
They use their skills to provide support to our field operatives.
Genolt, Shale─be so kind as to give our friends an overview of your duties.
