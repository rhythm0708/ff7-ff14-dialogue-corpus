<huff> Need to get help...
Forename! No sooner did I arrive than this man came running, out of breath...
You're an adventurer? Thank the Twelve!
It's the bandits from the Quiveron Manseâ”€they've fallen on a chocobo carriage over by the Clutch!
The carriage only had one guard, and he was sorely outnumbered. Please, you must help him!
That has to be Nhagi... With me, Forename!
