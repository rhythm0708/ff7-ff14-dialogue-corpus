Aye, aye, initiating firing sequence!Release safety locks...deploy main cannon!
Ansfrid, Hrudolf, Emelin...For us. For our people. For our future.
I need you to confirm the target, Commander.
Specula Imperatoris, main tower. Fire when ready.
What in the seven hells!?
Long-range artillery?
Those treacherous bastards... Their people were still fighting!Full retreat, now! Relay the orders!
Understood!
All forces, retreat! I repeat: all forces, retreat!
By the Twelve, did you see that!? The main tower just collapsed!
You heard it too, didn't you? It must have been the cannon at Castrum Abania. But that was an imperial installation, and their troops were still─
Dammit, no one's responding! I don't know if the shell is being jammed or...
We have to go right now! They need our help!
This way! There's no time to lose!
It's worse than it looks─ H-He probably wasn't even─ Pull yourself together.The gate. This is our way inside.
We need to find my brother. Right...now.
We need to find my brother. Right...now.
I'm glad you're here, Forename. In case it isn't obvious, the imperials fired on us. On Specula Imperatoris.
I didn't think they had it in them. To kill their own men just to kill us! Gods damn them all!
Where is my brother? Tell me where he is! I want to see him!
He was in the tower when it was struck. But that need not mean anything. Our forces are still evacuating, and many remain unaccounted for.
Alisaie? Alisaie, listen: there are soldiers wounded and dying all around us─soldiers with families, just like you and me. They need our help. Do you understand?
...He's right.I'll take the north, you take the east.
