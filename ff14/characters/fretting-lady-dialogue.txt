Fie, fie... That tower isn't right, I tell you. All those magicks.
Years ago, when I lived in the provinces, the locals razed our village to the ground with the stuff. Made things appear and disappear and fly and burn. Can still see it when I close my eyes.
You've done us a good turn, dear, but let's not talk about that tower any longer. It's unnatural.
