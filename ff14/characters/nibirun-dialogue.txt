At last our time is come. Mercy for us all.
Farther still existed a star without strife...
How could anyone despair in a world such as this?
Release at last.
I choose death!
Looks can deceive. This place is beautiful...but cold.
...where none remembered life's trialsâ”€or its joys.
Is my time not yet come?
Only in death may we find peace!
O Ra-la, bringer of sweet oblivion! Hear our prayers!
Please, O merciful Ra-la! Free us from the shackles of mortality!
Death delivered on golden wings...
Beautiful creatures...the time has come.
Death's sweet release.
From nothing we were born! To nothing must we return!
