To deathpit with you!
Whatever this is about, Brayflox needs our help!
Tremble before might of Illuminati!
Whence came all these bombs!?
Spill bladder not over unstrong firebooms of Illuminati!
M-More lentfists!?
Yet more of them! At this rate...
Now seems as good a time as any...
I shall invoke a spell!
Pray keep the enemy at bay!
Aether, to me!
Have at you!
Psssheehee! Illuminati no match for furious gobfists of Brayflox!
More junk is awaiting Brayflox muchly! Brayflox is taking leave of uplanders!
Being embroiled in a cheese war was the last thing I expected coming to Sharlayan. At any rate, we have fulfilled Slowfix's request. Let us return with the good tidings and be on our way.
Uplanders are back! Did uplanders find friend of Slowfix?
Pshkohhh... Time has not cured recklessness of Brayflox. Without help from uplanders, Brayflox would now be dead gobbie. Slowfix owes uplanders debt of gratitude!
Slowfix and Brayflox are joined by unseverable gobbiebond. If Slowfix had known that uplanders are friends of Brayflox, Slowfix would have welcomed uplanders to gobbieflock at first meeting!
Pssshkoh... Uplanders have upheld bargain most highly. As promised, Slowfix makes uplanders honored citizens of Idyllshire, free to cross river at will.
Though uplanders must leave for now, Slowfix hopes that uplanders will pay many visits and help build great new nation!
You are most kind, my friend. You may be certain that we will return.
I must confess, at first it upset me to learn that my home had been occupied by others. But I see now that it is in good hands.
Under your care, I look forward to seeing Sharlayan thrive once more, to become a home to people of all races and creeds.
Slowfix has already ordered the gobwatch to let uplanders through. Safe travels!
Alphinaud, Forenameâ”€shall we, then?
