Ard...bert?
...Oh. Forgive me, I was...having a dream. Seldom do men visit us. What brings you to our village?
Did I hear you aright? You desire the crystal shoes...that you may confront the Lightwarden?
No. No, you mustn't think such thoughts.
Even if you are indeed immune to the Light's corruption, as you claim, vanquishing the king will bring you naught but sorrow.
Forget this folly. Return whence you came.
While we appreciate your concern, we have no choice in the matter. Will you not reconsider?
...
Come, my friends, let us leave him with his thoughts.
Hmmm... 'Tis harder by far to change the minds of they who mean well than they who mean ill.
Forgive me...but I'm not sure I understand...
And little wonder. 'Tis the first time thou hast set foot here. 'Twould behoove you all to learn something of the nature of this community, I think, and there is no surer way than to speak with its members.
In such wise, you will come to understand Seto's reason for refusing usâ”€and, I hope, gain an insight into how he may yet be persuaded...
So I bid ye seek out the amaro and make yourselves known unto them. A gentle touch shall suffice by way of a greeting.
