Stand your ground!
Leave the healing to me!
Get the wounded to safety!
If it's this bad here, I shudder to think what it's like elsewhere...
A timely arrival, Forename. I have my hands full here.
Mine own magicks shall suffice to aid Y'shtola. I bid thee offer succor to the guard.
Keep fighting!
You'll be all right!
Th-Thank you...!
The eater's aether swells. I would hate to find out what it intends to do next.
Defend me─let none interrupt my incantation.
Draw the lesser eaters within the perimeter!
Master Matoya has a few tricks up her sleeve. Allow me to demonstrate.
This will have to suffice...!
A most impressive trick indeed...
As if you've none of your own. Let's make for the Imperative, shall we?
As if you've none of your own. Let's make for the Imperative, shall we?
Someone hath made short work of these eaters...
Forename! You'll be glad to know that the locals have all taken shelter.
Nevertheless, we can't allow the eaters to gain any ground. With me!
That can't be good...
Gods damn it all, we're too late...
I couldn't...save them...
I'll follow the eater. You press on to the Imperative.
I'm staying with you!
We've lost too many already. We must hurry.
These eaters are too organized. They cannot merely be acting on instinct.
It is as we feared.
But our task is as it ever was─turn the tide!
The lives of the wounded are in our hands!
On your feet!
No time to catch our breath...
Have care. That is no ordinary eater.
More eaters...
They're protecting it, somehow. We shall need to deal with them first.
I feel a swell of aether! Gather around me, quickly!
My training wasn't for naught!
Perhaps now is the time to put my research to the test.
And yet more still come!
Forename, buy me some time. Alphinaud─I'll need aether.
Right. Everyone, channel your aether into Alisaie!
The stars shall grant thee succor.
Forward!
We fight for those who cannot!
There are so many...
Godsdammit!
Lyna!
Lyna, hold on!
They...they turned on me...
Thancred!
This...one...is mine!
