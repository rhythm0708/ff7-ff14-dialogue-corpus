Clever how it transforms.
Certainly an efficient way to test creations...
Looks like we're heading down.
I swear, every time you ride a lift...
I know, right!?
What could that illuminated place be?
Looks like this is as deep as it goes.
The archbishop must be close.
The champion of Hydaelyn.
Tell me: why do you despise the primals so?
They are the embodiment of mortal will─of mortal desire.
Plainly, you desire a foe to despise. And 'tis well that you do, for it is from the vortex of ceaseless conflict that Lord Zodiark shall be reborn.
Through the Joining, the world shall become whole again.
Then all shall be as once it was─as it should ever have remained.
For the glory of Lord Zodiark.
Your meddling ends here and now, Warrior of Light!
It's over, Ascians!
We'll teach you to underestimate us!
Come! We settle this once and for all!
Our might knows no bounds!
Fires of creation─arise!
My magicks flow as one!
Mortal scum! I will entomb you in ice!
Let us see you withstand two magicks at once!
Such strength! It defies all reason...
No! I will not be bested by the likes of them!
Lahabrea! It is time!
Very well. Let us show these mortals the true power of the Echo...
The power to break down the barriers of existence!
I am become you...
...And we are become one.
