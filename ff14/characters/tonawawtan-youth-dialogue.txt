Th-Thank you!
Save the thanks─just get to safety!
I'll hold the line here! Fall back to the palace!
Quickly, before it's overrun!
Thank you, Bakool Ja Ja!
This is simply how I do things now.
So, who wants to taste my blade next!?
That you should still live.
Zoraal Ja...?
By the gods... What has happened to you?
This is your butchery, isn't it?
After everything you've done in service to the throne, how could you betray us!?
My demand is simple: the dissolution of Tuliyollal and surrender of all its territories.
Refuse, and I will kill every last one of you.
Have you gone mad!?
No. My ambition remains unchanged.
To teach the masses the folly of war that they cry out for peace, and thus unite the world.
What has changed you so much, and in so short a time?
To harm the very people you swore to serve...
This is an unforgivable deed─committed by my son! My son!
You have heard my ultimatum.
And you will have my answer...
By my hands, I will end your madness.
Papa, wait! I should be the one to do this!
No. His sins are mine to bear.
Fear not. While Zoraal Ja is strong, he has never been Father's equal in combat.
I believed you long dead. To have the chance to kill you myself is an unforeseen blessing.
Farewell, Zoraal Ja, my son... And forgive me...
What!?
How!?
Despite his old age, the mighty Gulool Ja Ja remains a fearsome foe indeed.
You retain the vitality of two souls despite the passing of one.
I shall even the odds.
Papa...?
Even the blessed are mortal...
Father!
Zoraal Jaaa!!!
You are no match for me.
Murderer! On my honor as Vow of Resolve, I'll make you pay!
So the once faint-hearted girl would live up to her title.
Very well. If only to demonstrate the disparity between us, I give you a chance to prove yourself.
Rally the entirety of your strength. Lay siege to my kingdom.
Strike me down, like I did Father. Then will you be his worthy successor.
Zoraal Ja, wait!
My warships will remain in your skies.
When you fail to prove your worth, I shall order them to lay waste to Tuliyollal.
Choose your next steps wisely.
Father, no! This cannot be!
I can scarcely believe my eyes...
How could this happen?
We did everything we could. Everything... But it simply wasn't enough...
Twelve have mercy...
...
No... Papa can't die... He can't...
How... How could this happen?
Enough... I am beyond saving...
Father, please! You can't give up!
Are you there...old friend...?
I'm right here. I'm right here.
Look after...my children...
What?
I'm an old fossil like you. I've only got so many years left.
But if that's what you want, it would be an honor.
You and I...must go on another journey together someday...
Aye, ye can count on it.
Wuk Lamat... Koana...
Yes, Papa.
The graves of the Yok Huy... You saw them, yes? I always found their teachings comforting...
Please, Father, you must save your strength.
Our flesh may wither and die. But so long as we are remembered, we are never truly gone.
Through you, my hopes survive... Through you, I live on...
So do not mourn me. Walk tall...and see our nation to a brighter future.
Papa! Papa!
Papa!!!
I don't understand...
If only I'd been more careful...
Gulool Ja Ja was so proud to be succeeded by his children. To think that he will never get to see them carry on his legacy...
What can we do now...?
At a time like this, we must take the initiative. There will be countless people in need of help.
We must see to the people... Assess casualties, as well as any damage done to the city. Yes...
R-Right. So, uh... I...
Vow Wuk Lamat. Vow Koana. I bring word from the city. The enemy has withdrawn, and the Landsguard have begun rendering aid to the people.
Casualties within our ranks have hindered progress, but we continue to do all that we can.
I thank you for the report. Please inform the guard they are to prioritize such efforts until further notice.
The people... I need to help them.
We will assist you in whatever way we can, of course.
Thank you, thank you. There are sure to be wounded everywhere─more than I could count.
We'll split up and help all of them. You can count on us!
Alphinaud and Alisaie, could you take Bayside Bevy? And Krile and Erenville, the palace perimeter.
As for Forename, please come to the Resplendent Quarter with me. We'll all meet back here afterwards.
If you're still in pain, there's no need to push yourself.
You should be all right now.
I'm afraid we were too late to save him...
So Bakool Ja Ja protected you... That's wonderful.
Where are you hurt?
