Well met, sinner.
I was looking forward to a welcome respite here in the Crystarium, but the mood here's not exactly conducive to relaxation, as I'm sure you've noticed.
Aye, I'd wager you know more about what's going on than anyone else in this city. Care to share?
Hmmm... I can't say that I envy you your prey.
Dark work, this twisting of the Warriors of Light's legacy. Reminds me of what became of ol' Dikaiosyne─though this “Ascian” of yours is a fair bit more chatty.
I'm tempted to silence him myself. Branden made his mistakes─I'm sure they all did─but the past is the past. They've earned their rest.
What, you want me to leave it to you?
...Right, right. I'm not the only one carrying all that weight. Very well. But only because you asked.
Remember: if you ever need me, just say the word. I'll be there.
