How strange this feeling... The thrill before battle... A battle in which I may die.
...W-Wise words, I am sure. I suppose I should rightly thank you for your honesty...but I have so little time left...
Yes...yes of course we will! I must have faith! I must have courage!
I have not always understood the motives of the gods, but I have accepted their guidance ever since I was a child. If they would have us fight, I must believe they have their reasons.
So I shall fight with all my might! And if it is the gods' will, then we shall win!
Already, I sense a change in the people. Their hearts soothed, their resolve strengthened. This we owe to you.
We are of the soil. The wind and the water. We are not conquerors.
But we are yet the children of Nhaama─we are yet Xaela. We were made for battle─to kill and be killed. We delight not in such things, but let no man doubt that they are in our nature.
Flesh, blood, bone─that which was given, we offer unto the gods as tribute. This day we embrace death. Ours and our enemies'.
So too must you embrace this truth, for this is who we are. Who you are become, as warriors of the Steppe.
May the gods guide you to victory.
All that remains is to wait for daybreak!
You are ready for battle, Forename?
I see you, soil bearers...
The soil has been scattered, and the Steppe reborn! Sanctified and unbound, she calls for a new khagan!
Go forth and claim her, Dotharl, and bring death to all who bar your way!
It begins, Grandmother.
I must say, it's been a while... Is everyone ready?
Hah hah hah! A samurai is always ready. You shall remember this soon enough once I have taken to the field.
So we take on all comers, and then it's off to Doma! I can't wait!
Thank you, my friends.Upon the soil of one and all shall our deeds be inscribed...
Grant us favor, O Mother of the Dusk, and to victory guide the Mol!
