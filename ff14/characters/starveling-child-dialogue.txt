I ain't goin' nowhere, missus! I'm too hungry to move, besides, so you'll have to carry me!
A cookie!? ...Well, if Wystan really wants me to go home, then all right. But I want two next time!
But Wystan always plays with us! Why won't he come out and play?
Wow, a ginger cookie! I'd better save some for my brother. I know─I'll go home and eat it with him!
Wystan's kind to us. I like him.
This is for me? I want to eat it, but then again I don't, because then it'd be gone.
Tell Wystan thanks, and...tell him I'm sorry for getting in the way.
I like playing with Wystan. He makes sure no one bullies us.
Wystan's worried about us? Oh, I don't want to make him worried. I'm a good girl, so I'll go home.
Thank you, adventurer. I only wish I could do more. Stonesthrow is no place for a child.
...Not that my childhood was much happier. Never enough food to go around, nor work to earn it─but no shortage of contempt from the great and the good.
I remember thinking things could only get better... Yet now, after the Calamity and everything else...for us refugees to be forced to live outside the gates like bloody beastmen is a disgrace.
They say with enough money you can change the laws here. So I'm going to make a fortune and do just that!
I'll buy the excavation rights and start my own mining business. Then I'll give my fellow refugees the work they're crying out for, and pay them fairly!
The mining companies have profited from our suffering for too long. But in their hubris they've grown complacent─presenting us with a golden opportunity.
And we will take it, adventurer─we will reclaim our dignity, and with it our place within those walls.
