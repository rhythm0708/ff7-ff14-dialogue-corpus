I see you in Eorzea before. You great and famous hero.
...Gah, I've had enough of playing the simpleton. There was a time when we took great pains to maintain the deception, but with more of you Eorzeans coming to Tural, it's become impractical.
Besides, my mercenary days are over. Too many of our warband have fallen, and so we head home to lick our wounds...
I look forward to a long soak in the hot springs of Urqopacha. And no complaints when I dance the bathing dance.
