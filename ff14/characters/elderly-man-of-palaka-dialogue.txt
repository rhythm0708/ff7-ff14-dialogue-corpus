'Tis a perilous path you walk. Death lurks in the dark, and is the sole promise that awaits at journey's end.
You will tremble with terror. You will weep tears of anger and despair...
...But do not avert your eyes. See your life for what it is.
Then will you see how the hardships make you strong.
Every doubt reforged as scales for your armor.
Every agony to temper your blade...
Thank you, lad. We'd almost forgotten who we are.
My undying gratitude to you as well, my friends.
You were searching for Mehvan, no? We must return home. I pray you help the boy find his friend.
Gladly. We dispatched what beasts we could, but the roads are still dangerous. Stay together, and go in safety.
That was very impressive, what you did back there. Those words seemed to resonate with your people.
They should. They were the first spoken unto our ancestors by the divinity of legend.
I'm easily upset, and fish are wont to flee a temperamental hand. So I recite the teachings, over and over, to calm myself.
They're lovely and inspiring to hear. Though I imagine they were born of great misfortune.
They are born of life. There's as much bad as good in itâ”€more, many would attest. All the more reason to appreciate the good when you can.
I won't argue with that.
In darkness seek joy. Surrender not to sadness, and see beyond despair. Walk free, and bear the light for others to follow.
And with that, let us see if we can't find Mehvan.
Did you see!? That beast was chasing someone!
Wh-What!? Was that Mehvan!?
We must go after them at once!
Over there! My view was blocked by the trees, but I'm sure I saw someone being chased by a beast!
Forename, go with Matsya and search along the river! Alphinaud and I will circle around from the south!
We've reached the Font of Maya... Maybe they're hiding in the ruins?
That's her... No, I'm...I'm sure of it! Mehvan!
