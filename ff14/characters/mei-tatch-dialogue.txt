Looking for “Master Reeq,” are we? Heh, I daresay you're the only one.
Word is mummy and daddy cut him off, so there's no point in pretending to like the little shite anymore. Last I saw him he was moping about like someone had shot his amaro. I'm sure he'll turn up eventually.
I told you, if the little lordling isn't at his table, then I've no idea where he is. Ask someone else.
