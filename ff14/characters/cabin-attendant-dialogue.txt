Welcome back, MistressMaster Surname. Your cabin is just as you left it─minus a light layer of dust!
You have a moment?
There's something I wanted to talk to you about...
So...I, uh...
Yaargh!
It's just too...stuffy in here, that's what.
We should go outside! Aye, a nice walk in the fresh air─that's what we need!
Sorry to drag you away from your nice, comfortable cabin, but I could feel the walls closing in.
Oh, I know! I'll take you to one of my favorite places in Tuliyollal─that should help me get my thoughts in order.
We'll go to the Resplendent Quarter and make our way up from there!
