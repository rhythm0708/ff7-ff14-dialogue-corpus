Should you value your lives, you will quit this place at once. Now, begone with you!
Well, I'd say we're off to a fine start.
From ageless sleep, I bid thee rise!
Bring unto them a swift demise!
Look how they make a mess of my floors! Swish and flick, my lovelies. Swish and flick!
Magicked brooms? Now where have I seen these before?
I call forth blades to run them through!
Brave knights of eld, tried-and-true.
If you insist on making a mess of my palace, then you leave me no choice...
Oh dear. They don't yet seem inclined to talk.
Well, it was your idea to brandish blades at the door.
Come, my lovelies! There is filth that wants for cleaning!
