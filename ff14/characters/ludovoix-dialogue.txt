Excuse me, can you repeat that? You wish to offer your services to House Durendaire? And what, pray tell, do you wish to receive in exchange?
Hah, how absurd! As if we would permit an outsider to peruse the records of the Observatorium.
Do not mistake our courtesy for friendliness. The Holy See of Ishgard may allow foreigners to travel freely within these lands, but we do not intend to offer succor to strangers.
Halone have mercy, are you still here? You may take shelter within our walls if you insist, but do not distract me while I am on duty. We're stretched thin as it is.
And where in the hells is that knight I sent out on patrol? He should have returned ages ago!
Hmmm... Perhaps I have a use for you, after all. If you still wish to aid us, search the wilds to the west for my missing man. You will know him by his uniformâ”€that of House Durendaire, as is mine.
