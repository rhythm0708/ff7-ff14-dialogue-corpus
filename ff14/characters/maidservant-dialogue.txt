My lord! Forgive me, but the lady Yotsuyuâ”€she's gone!
Gone!?
I beg your pardons, my lords. I was certain she had fallen asleep...
No, no, the responsibility is mine. 'Twas I who gave her a room instead of a cell.
She may simply have wandered outside. We will organize search parties.
Might I call upon your assistance?
Help... Help...
Help... Help me...
If only I hadn't remembered.
He should hate me.
But I will not suffer his kindness. Not after what I did to him.
Who's there!?
