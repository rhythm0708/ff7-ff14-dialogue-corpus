He'll only talk if he's completely comfortable with you.
You know him?
After a fashion. But never mind that. How about something to wet your whistle?
Adorable as you are, it's on the house. I can recommend our specialâ”€Her Majesty. I'll prepare one without liquor for the boy, too.
Uh, thanks, but no thanks. We're supposed to meet a friend named Cahciua.
But we ran into the child on the way, and he led us here.
Ohhh, so you're with Cahciua.
In that case, go and have a chat with big Tassos there. He'll show you to a fun place.
What about him?
I don't think he's in a mood to talk, so he can tend the bar with me.
This has taken a turn for the strange, but you don't think we're walking into a trap, do you?
Damned if this doesn't have suspicious written all over it...
...
If you feel like that drink after all, just let me know.
