I shall fight. For the world...and for you, my heart!
Embrace death!
Arise, my servants, and come to my aid!
Oh dear, tired so soon?
Very well, you may rest...but not in peace!
Hehe, such lovely blossoms of blood!
More! I need more to attend me! If you cannot stand, then crawl!
Come now, death isn't so terrible. Not when you have company, hehehe...
I would behold your beautiful blossoms! Let them bloom!
Plunge into the depths of oblivion!
Tainted though I am, I am still a Warrior of Light!
These grounds will be strewn with your flesh!
Why? Why can I not reach you? Is it because...I am tainted?
That I should lose again...
A pinch of pixie magic, and─presto─a secret passage to Lakeland!
You're a godssend, Feo Ul! Thank everyone for us!
I see it! The Crystal Tower!
