The Thunderyards? Was one of the hunters slain by a beast?
It was a hunter all right, and a veteran at that. But it was no fiend that did him inâ”€only a random bolt of lightning.
Such a senseless way to die. They say that he expended his last soul cells during Zoraal Ja's attack on the city...
For an upright, hardworking man to meet such an unceremonious end... It feels wrong...
