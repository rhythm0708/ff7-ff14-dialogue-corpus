O mighty Ifrit, Lord of the Inferno!
Your humble servants beseech You! Grace us with Your divine presence!
O mighty Ifrit! We bring before You ignorant savages who know not Your godhead!
If it please You, Lord, scorch their heathen souls with Your cleansing flame, and mark them as Your own!
B-Bloody hells...
Bring those two as well!
Unnngh...
Wh-What's going on!? Th-This ain't what we agreed!
None but servants of Lord Ifrit may behold the rite of summoning. The souls of unbelievers are forfeit!
Nooo! Spare me, I beg you!
