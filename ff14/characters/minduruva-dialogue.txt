Begone from our tower...
Begone...or become prey for the Magus!
Behold our ingenious magicks!
Dance! Dance until death claims you!
So, you have chosen defiance...
Onwards to the upper floors!
What is it made of, I wonder?
They've been awfully busy taking prisoners...
Aye, whatever it takes.
A mockery of the Thavnairian gods!
