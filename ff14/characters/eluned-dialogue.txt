Good morrow to you, madam. Have you come to pay your respects to this man?
Never before have I seen such a queer device. You say that it measures the passing of time?
Mayhap they are more common in Garlemald. I am given to understand that its cities are filled with all manner of amazing technologies.
Marques said that it belonged to the deceased? Oh dear... You don't suppose that the owner might have been a Garlean spy? It may behoove us to notify the authorities in Camp Drybone.
But...mayhap more importantly, how did Marques manage to repair this device? I knew he had a talent for the trades, but this goes far beyond mending fences and thatching rooves...
I recognize you now, Forename. Allow me to express my deepest condolences for those who lost their lives in the attack.
I apologize if discussing this upsets you, but...you should know that the bodies of your comrades are presently being removed from the Waking Sands and prepared for transport here.
If you wish to leave this work to others, I understand. However, taking part might help you to find closure.
