Ah, you must be the adventurer of whom the Yellowjackets sent word. I hear you are to brave the depths of the Sastasha Seagrot.
The occupants of those caves are rumored to be as numerous as they are bloodthirsty. No matter what the epic tales would have you believe, strolling into such a den of savagery alone would be the height of foolishness. No, you shall need companions.
And you shall need the training we here at the Hall of the Novice can provide! I strongly suggest that you study the fundamentals of group combat before continuing on your mission.
The Smith here oversees the training schedules. Speak with him, and you can register for exercises tailored to your particular field of expertise.
When you have mastered all that our masters have to teach, then it will be time to head north once more. Report to the Yellowjacket scout at the mouth of the Sastasha Seagrot, and he will furnish you with the details of your duty.
When your skills have been honed and your mind sharpened, continue onwards to the north. The Yellowjacket scout stationed before the Sastasha Seagrot will have the details of your mission.
