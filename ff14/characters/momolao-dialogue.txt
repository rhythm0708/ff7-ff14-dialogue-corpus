Yeah, I'm Momolao. What've you got for me?
From Tenny!? Oh Tenny, you...you big dummy!
We've all been a mess since he left. It's just not the same without him.
But now I know that some things will never change, no matter how far apart we are!
He's still the same old Tenny. Still celebrating Starlight with us, hehe.
He sent gifts for all of us!? Oh, someone's going to cry. I can feel it.
Let's see─Larkin said he'd be in the Gold Court, and Othuel had to do something near Milvaneth Sacrarium. Thanks, missmister. Tell Tenny “Happy Starlight” for us.
You'll find Larkin in the Gold Court and Othuel by Milvaneth Sacrarium. They're going to love their gifts, I just know it.
