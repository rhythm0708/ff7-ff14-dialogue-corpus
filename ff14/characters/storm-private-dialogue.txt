Sir!
What is it, Private? And this had better be important.
Sir! We've received a report from a lookout in lower La Noscea, sir! Imperial forces have fired upon a Highwind Skyways airship.
The vessel is in a bad way, sir, and appears to be banking for an emergency landing in Cedarwood.
Cedarwood? Damn it. We have no troops available in that area. The bulk of our infantry is bogged down on the coast, skirmishing with the fishbacks.
Surnameâ”€this is highly irregular, but I fear your first duty in service to the Maelstrom must needs be unofficial.
If our man in lower La Noscea is correct, the airship will come down in territory crawling with imperial scouts. If there are any survivors, we must reach them before the Garleans do.
Make haste to Cedarwood, locate the airship, and if any of its occupants are alive, make sure they come to no further harm. We'll see about swearing you in upon your return.
