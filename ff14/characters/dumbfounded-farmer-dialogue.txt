If Tuliyollal falls to the enemy, what will happen to us? To our homes, our farmsâ”€everything we've worked so hard to build?
Lives and communities and histories, all reduced to ash by these merciless villains...
I heard Vow Wuk Lamat is planning to address the people, but what's the point? What can she and her brother possibly have to say?
Really? The Dawnservants have a plan already? They've lost so much, yet they're prepared to carry on.
And standing around worrying about what's to come will change nothing...
It would be a lie to say I'm hopeful for the future, but I will go hear what they intend to do.
