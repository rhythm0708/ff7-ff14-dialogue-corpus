Have you heard anything of what's on the moon?
I have no doubt that we can make it up there, but the “searching for a new star” part of the plan sounds awfully vague to me.
I asked the Forum, but they will only tell us that our collaborators “have everything under control.” Forgive me, but I don't feel particularly safe wandering through the sea of stars on gods-know-what made by gods-know-who!
You mean to say that I can speak with them directly!? Amazing! I hope they like questions...
