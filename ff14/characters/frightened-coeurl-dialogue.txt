Hm? Here for the leftovers, are you? Not like my brother to send someone in his stead, but so be it.
It's all in the sacks over yonder. They're bleedin' heavy, mind, so be careful when you pick 'em up.
Ah, the new face. You have my leftovers?
Huh, well I'll be...you actually went and brought the whole lot. Much obliged, much obliged...
It's saltpeter for making firesand, in case you're curious what it's all for. The rocks by the lakes've got good deposits.
'Tain't hard for my brother to pass for any other plodding quarryman, all the while sweeping bits and pieces off to the side, to bundle up and sell to the sutlers what trade with the Resistance.
It's a living, and a way of fighting back besides. Our way of spitting in the Garleans' eye for putting our father in an imperial uniform and shipping him off to some faraway province fifteen years ago.
Dunno if he's dead or alive, even. Though, if he were alive, he'd not be long for this world if we were caught fighting for the Resistance. So this is the best we can do.
...That's the long and the short of it. We do what we can, though we know it's not enough.
I think you'll find that most folks here ain't much different. Everybody's got a reason, but in the end, the result is the same.
I suppose I just...I just wanted you to know, is all. That I─that we know why you're here, and that even if we can't join you, we...we wish we could...
Ah, there you are, Forename. I've been trying to help the villagers deal with this food shortage of theirs.
Recently, the imperials have been swooping into villages unannounced and seizing supplies in order to prevent the people from stockpiling, in case they might be in league with the Resistance.
It's not much, but I've taught them a few tricks to better hide what little they've got left. How's Lyse getting on, by the way? You'd think people would be more inclined to trust a local girl─assuming they remember her, that is...
N-No, I didn't mean to...
