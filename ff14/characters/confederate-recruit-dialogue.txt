Who...who are you? You do not look like a woman of the Confederacy.
...Forgive me. 'Twas but yesterday we bid farewell to one of our own, and I worried that she might have lost her way.
We laid her to rest in a boat and pushed her out till the current claimed it. For the sea is our home, now and ever after.
But those sent thither with burdened hearts may drift back to shore, it is said...
Out of concern for her comrades, she strove to earn far more than her keep. She hunted rare and deadly game in treacherous waters, and lost her life for it.
But my vigil is endedâ”€her vessel has not returned to Onokoro! She has made peace with this life and placed her faith in us to live on...
So, what of my recruit? Did you find him napping on the beach or some such?
What? All this time he was standing watch for the funerary vessel? Huh...
So rarely does he give voice to his thoughts. I had no idea our comrade's death had affected him so. Too quick was I to judge him.
It is good that you went in my stead, else I might have misspoken and made a fool of myself. Please accept this as a token of my gratitude.
