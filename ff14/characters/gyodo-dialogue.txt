...What, what? Why do you stare? You have business with me?
By the Twelve, a talking fish!
Yes, yes, a talking fish. How very observant of you, ijin. <sigh> You find me in good spirits, so your rudeness I will ignore this once─but only if you address me again in the proper manner.
Sorry, I've never met a─ Let's start again. You're Gyodo, right? My name is Lyse, and this is Forename. We're looking for some friends of ours...
I see, I see... Both these ones I know well. I helped them secure passage across the Ruby Sea.
Really? That's wonderful! Could you do the same for us?
Yes, yes, this would not be a problem. For you, I could charter a ship this very day.
But the journey is fraught with much peril! The fare will not be cheap. Are you sure you can afford to pay?
I didn't think to bring any money...but surely Tataru will let us take whatever we need from the Scions' coffers, right?
We wouldn't be the only passengers, though... Could we take a moment to talk it over with our friends?
Yes, yes, but hurry! Your ship must depart under cover of darkness. We shall meet again at sunset on the Tasogare Bridge. Do not forget your fare! Bring many gil, yes!?
It's about time our luck changed! Alphinaud and the others will be thrilled!
