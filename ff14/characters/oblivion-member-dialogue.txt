This way, this way!
Where's the support we called for!?
More machines over there!
We won't let them through!
I-I have no souls left... If I get killed again, I...I...
Haaah... Haaah... I'm still alive... I'm still alive...
I-It's nothing serious. I fell down, that's all. I'll be fine.
All my souls, gone in a blink... This is a nightmare...
Haaah... Haaah... I'm still alive... I'm still alive...
I-It's nothing serious. I fell down, that's all. I'll be fine.
Whew... I feel a little calmer now. Thank you...
We managed to get to safety, but so many didn't... Please be careful.
Oh, thank you for coming to save us! It's such a relief to see Her Majesty is unharmed...
It's only a graze. You needn't worry about me─just help those who are still out there.
We're in your debt! We'll try to get to safety before more of them come.
We'll get through this! We will!

I don't understand what's happening or why... But it gives me courage to know you're here.
They should be fine here.
Let's press on!
You came!
We must hold them off!
More of them!
Confound it...
There...
Is that all of them?
Looks like that does it for this area.
Look─the king's forces are on the move!
There are still civilians on True Vue!
Well, we can't leave the wounded. Let's divide into two groups.
Krile, Raha─please stay here and render aid.
The rest of us will go and deal with the machines!
Alright!
Otis! You've got to wake up!
“Otis”...?
