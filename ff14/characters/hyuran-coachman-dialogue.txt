Eager to be off, are ye? Aye, well, I was meanin' to have a word with ye about that. Runner from the Blades says we might have a problem.
A fierce-lookin' beastie's been sighted south of the bridge to Hammerlea. Might be as someone's eyes are playin' tricks on 'em, o' course, but it don't pay to gamble in this business.
Now I know ye can handle yerself in a fight, but this lot here's another story. So I was thinkin' ye might go on ahead an' have a quick look around─make sure the area's safe, like. An' if ye come across anythin' dangerous, ye know what to do.
When yer satisfied the way's clear, meet us outside Horizon. The Blades tell me the road there's safe, so I reckon we can make it that far on our own─assumin' the selfsame bastards don't try to rob us, that is.
So there was a beastie! “Was” bein' the operative word, eh!? Hah hah!
Well fought, madam, well fought! Ah, if only I were in better health, I should have been proud to stand at your side!
