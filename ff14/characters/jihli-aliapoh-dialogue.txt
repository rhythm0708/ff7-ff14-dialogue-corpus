Welcome, my friend! I take it the Hatching-tide decorations have caught your eye?
It warms my heart to greet yet another reveler, for I am the host of this event─Jihli Aliapoh, at your humble service. If I'm not mistaken, you're an adventurer, yes? Might I have your name?
Forename...a festive name, to be sure. I hope that you shall find all things Hatching-tide to your liking─in fact, I know you shall!
For I have seen it in a dream clear as the one I had many moons ago, where the Twelve Archons delivered unto me a prophecy which inspired this occasion. I have worked tirelessly since that night to do their words justice.
Oh, Forename, is that really you? I had hoped I might see you again, but I did not dare assume. Nonetheless, it warms my heart that you are eager to revel in Hatching-tide once more.
This year, it was again a dream that sparked my imagination...a dream of a goobbue, massive and marvelous, standing upon the stage where else but in Ul'dah, so many malms away!
Wreathed in radiant flowers of pink, the darling goobbue held in her hands an egg decorated most lavishly.
