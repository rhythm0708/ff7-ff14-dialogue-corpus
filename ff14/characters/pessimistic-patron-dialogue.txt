I used to live for the moment, not caring what might happen on the morrow. But now that we have peace, I find myself thinking about the future...and feeling anxious...
What? Your home is threatened with destruction? Wicked white, why are you wasting time in a drinking hole!?
Ugh, but as I say it, I feel the sting of hypocrisy... Gods, I need to take control of my life. Need to face my troubles head-onâ”€and the same goes for you!
No one ever found answers at the bottom of a cup. None worth a damn, at least. We both know exactly what we need to do, don't we?
