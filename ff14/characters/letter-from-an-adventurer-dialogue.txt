I'm but a faceless adventurer. One of those who have been in the business for a while without standing out.
Recently, menacing towers appeared across the land, in the wake of which frightening phenomena broke out. The Final Days or some such.
I don't know how you fared during that time, but if truth be told, it was a little overwhelming for me. Gods know I struggle to get by even without apocalyptic threats to worry about.
So many things don't go the way I hope, and I often find myself frustrated and discouraged. Full many times I've wanted to give up. To turn away from everything and everyone.
But every time, there has been something that has saved me. Be it an awe-inspiring view or a kindly stranger, something has given me the strength to take another step.
So come what may, I intend to carry on as far as my path leads. I won't surrenderâ”€and I pray that neither will you!Yours in perseverance,A Faceless Adventurer
So many letters of gratitude...
