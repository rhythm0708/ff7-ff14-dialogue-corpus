Oh, that is a surprise! Not many bound for Nabaath Areng these days.
I do know of a trolley that once went thereâ”€it used to travel between all the settlements and mines of the Hills of Amber.
It is locked behind a gate, however. I assume that will have kept it from being stolen or damaged, but it also prevents it from being of much use.
