I have heard the tales of your many grand endeavors. The lord commander has also been most effusive in his praise.
I am Thordan VII, Archbishop of the Ishgardian Orthodox Church, and I bade you come here that I might offer my personal apologies.
You will forgive me for not calling upon you as courtesy would dictate, but as you can see, my more sprightly days are long behind me. But I digress.
Your companions were wrongly accused of heresy and subjected to gross indignities. This, I am sorry to say, was the result of negligence on the part of our nation's protectorsâ”€negligence born of an excess of zeal. Is that not so, Ser Zephirin?
