It is done, my lord.
I... <cough> F-Forgive my impertinence, my lord, but these orders... I am uncertain as to what end they serve.
Revolution.
Our friends...the very isle itself...everyone and everything...
...No. No, it avails us naught to speculate. Urianger will send word if there are any developments. Until such time as he does, we must remain firmly focused on that which is within our power to change. With that in mind, I would speak of a different matter. One closer to home.
It concerns aetheric fluctuations which we had previously attributed to Good King Moggle Mog XII.
That the king is no more is a blessing for which we have you to thank.
Yet all is not well in the Twelveswood. Our latest readings reveal an ongoing aetheric disturbance of considerable magnitude. They may even suggest the presence of a primal.
Needless to say, the mere possibility warrants immediate investigation, and I would have you─
Ascilia? I do not wish to interrupt, but we have a problem.
What manner of problem?
A band of refugees─hailing from Ul'dah, this time─are come to Revenant's Toll seeking asylum.
It would seem they expect us to afford them the same treatment we gave the Domans. At present, they are in the Seventh Heaven, awaiting a formal response.
...I see. Mayhap this was to be expected. I shall meet with them at once.
Ascilia. You know full well we haven't the resources to accommodate many more people. Consider what will happen if you do this. Word will spread, and more will follow.
...Your opinion is duly noted─but I will hear their suit.
Forename─I should be grateful for your presence at this meeting.
I apologize for keeping you waiting. My name is Minfilia, and I lead the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.
