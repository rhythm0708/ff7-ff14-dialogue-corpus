Perhaps you can help clear things up. The lady says she's looking for a girl with a “ryu,” but I haven't the faintest what that is.
Ahhh, then you must be speaking of the odd little critter I spotted a few moments ago. It was wearing what looked like a dragon costume, and was waddling after a young girl.
I'm imagining it, all right, but I can't say I've ever seen─ Actually...hold that thought. Now that you mention it, there was a chocobo chick wearing what looked like a dragon costume. If that's your ryu, then aye, I saw it waddling after a young girl.
I'm afraid I didn't observe where they went, though. Sorry I couldn't be of help.
Many thanks for your assistance! In my haste, I had neglected to explain the meaning of the word ryu...
As the ryu metsuke told me, the creature doesn't exist in Eorzea. If I had begun by clarifying that it is similar to a dragon, I could have avoided the misunder─
...Oh. I daresay I know now why our mascot has so struggled to win over the masses.
I shall speak with this guardswoman a little more, in case she has aught else of note to share. Once I'm finished, I plan to scour the upper decks.
In the meantime, might I trouble you to search the lower decks? Once we have finished, let us reconvene at Bulwark Hall.
Should you glean any valuable information, we can discuss it at Bulwark Hall once we have both finished our rounds. May your search prove successful!
