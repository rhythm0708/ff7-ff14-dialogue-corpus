Bertliana!? Gods preserve! What happened!?
I was out foraging...when the Corpse Brigade came... They took me to their hideout...and they...they... <sob>
The whole while, they laughed at me... <sob> They said that I suffer...b-because I cling on to hope... <sob>
Is it wrong to dream of home? Is it wrong to call ourselves Ala Mhigans?
Do not heed such poisonous notions, child. Our dreams are what sustain us. Be strongâ”€I swear to you, those villains will answer for their crimes in due time. But tell me...does anyone else know of this?
Wilred... He saw me outside... He was so angry...
I must tend to Bertliana. In the meantime, I need you to find out what the young ones make of this. I fear that they may do something rash.
