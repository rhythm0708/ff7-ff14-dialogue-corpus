No, no, not this one. Not even close, kupo!
Hm? You know her, Kuplo Kopp?
Well, not exactly, but we did once share a carriage. Isn't that right?
How are the readings?
Same as the last. There is a disturbance here as well, and newly manifested at that.
Kuplo Kopp seems convinced of your innocence. But if this isn't your doing, whose is it?
Ever since the Calamity, the forest's been really sensitive.
The slightest disruption to the aetheric flow...
And this sort of thing happens!
It seems we have little choice...
Do you want to get eaten!? Hit them harder!
I'm trying, I'm trying!
There's more! Be careful!
If you value your life, stay close!
Well done! We're almost there!
Hear... Feel... Think...
Crystal bearer...
I am Hydaelyn. All made one.
A Light there once was that shone throughout this realm...yet it hath since grown dim.
And as it hath faltered, so hath Darkness risen up in its stead, presaging an end to Life.
For the sake of all, I beseech thee: deliver us from this fate!
The power to banish the Darkness dwelleth in the Crystals of Light. Journey forth and lay claim to them.
By thy deeds shall the Crystals reveal themselves to thee.
Only believe, for the Light liveth in thy heart.
Go now, my child, and shine thy Light on all creation.
You fainted. A surfeit of aether, no doubt.
Hm? And what have we here?
Our culprit, it would seem. An Ixal. And no ordinary Ixal, eitherâ”€a chieftain.
That they would venture this deep into enemy territory... The beastmen may indeed be acting under orders.
