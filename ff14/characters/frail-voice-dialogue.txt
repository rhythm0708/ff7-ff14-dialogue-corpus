Licinia... Where is everyone?
I-Is something the matter?
A voice from inside, you say? You must be imagining things. Everyone's out here!
Perhaps a baby almasty has found its way into the house. It wouldn't be the first time.
Without the soldiers to scare them off, wild animals have been roaming closer to the settlements. Some have been known to attack people, too...
I-I've just had an idea. If you and yours are strong enough to defeat a legatus, then surely a few beasts shouldn't pose a threat.
If you've a mind to continue helping us, perhaps you could head to the other side of the lake. There's a small group of tappers living there─people whose job was to extract ceruleum. They still do, from what we can tell.
I've already tried asking if they would share their fuel with us, but they're not willing to give it away. They want food in exchange─lots of food─and that's something we don't have and can't get on our own.
On top of that, to even reach their den, we'd have to make our way past all those creatures.
Would you be willing to go in our place? We only need enough ceruleum to last until the others are strong enough to travel to your camp. If the offer still stands, that is. Oh, and I don't expect you to give up your own supplies...but there might be another way to pay the tappers.
Thank you so much!
Hmm? Ah, yes, of course! If I see any, I'll be sure to shoo them away!
To reach Tapper's Den, you'll have to cross the lake. The ice is thick enough to support a person's weight, but if you'd rather not take the risk, you'll need to take the long way around.
Finding the entrance can be a bit tricky, too, so it's easier to just look for someone standing guard outside. However you decide to head there, please be careful.
I'm not sure what else the tappers might need besides provisions, though I daresay that capable fighters like yourself can offer them other forms of compensation. Culling dangerous beasts, that sort of thing.
