Seven hells, they've found us! Everyone, grab yer gear and make for the rendezvous point!
...So that's yer game, is it? Ahahaha! Sorry to disappoint ye, lass, but we're more than willin' to kill ye ourselves!
You've returned! Did you find my brethren? What of the twins? What happened!?
I see... Well...you had no choice. Better that a handful of them take a beating from you than the lot get butchered by the Flames.
Tell me, what did the merchant have to say when it was over?
Huh? But where else would he be? Unless... Unless he went to Stonesthrow to recruit others?
The merchant wished to approach the refugees in Stonesthrow, but was waiting until the Flames withdrew their forces from the vicinity. Now that they have, there's nothing to stop him from continuing his work.
How many more must perish in pursuit of this futile cause? How much more suffering must we endure before it ends?
Find him. Convince him to cease his mad quest. It will surely lead us to ruin.
