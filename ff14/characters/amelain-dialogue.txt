Indeed, I am Amelain of the Twin Adder. I understand you're here to learn of the sylphs, yes?
For all their whimsy, they are a wary lot. Particularly since the Empire has come to the Shroud.
Earn their trust, however, and they're as friendly as any folk. They have their quirks, but so do we all, no?
Would you know more, you'd do well to speak with the master of this hut, Rolfe. He's forgotten more about the sylphs than I'll ever know.
