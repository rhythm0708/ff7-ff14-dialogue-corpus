Pshhh... Shkohhh...By order of Chief Slowfix, uplanders can come and go at will.
One moment for clearing away barricade.
Finally, we can continue our journey.
Ahem. Barring any misadventure, we shall soon arrive at the cave where Matoya resides. Unless you have unfinished business in Idyllshire, let us strike out at once.
I am ready whenever you are. Let us go and meet the legendary Matoya.
Ahead lies the Answering Quarter, where the scholars of Sharlayan gathered to hone their knowledge.
Even from this distance, 'tis plain that much of it has been given back to the wilderness.
The cave in which Matoya resides is situated on the southern edge of the hinterlands.
In choosing the spot, my master desired privacy above all else. As such, the cave is extremely well hidden; you'll not find it unless you know to look for it.
We shall follow the road south until we reach a bridge. Rather than cross it, however, we shall ford the stream it spans, thence head straight until we arrive at the base of a bluff.
This is the entrance....Hm? You seem unconvinced, Forename. Well, that will only add to the surprise.
A word of warning before we proceed: stubborn geniuses make poor hosts, and time will have done naught to improve my master's temperament.
Doubt not but that there will be sentinels and traps both to deter unwanted guests. But we'll not be deterred, will we?
Go on and touch the wall yonder. You will want to have your weapon near at hand.
Those sentinels may suffice to discourage the average trespasser, but not the Warrior of Light.
The way should now be clear. Come, let us go and see my master.
