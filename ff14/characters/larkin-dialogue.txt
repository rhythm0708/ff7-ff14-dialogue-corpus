Hello, missmister! I've been very good this year. You can ask my friends!
...H-Handmade? From Tenny?
<sniff> I-I'm not crying! I just got snow in my eye... <sob>
...Last year, we all stood right here and made a promise to celebrate Starlight together. And Tenny remembered! Even though he moved away!
I thought that was the end for us, but friends always find a way, right? And Tenny will always be our friend! ...Tell him I said that, okay?
