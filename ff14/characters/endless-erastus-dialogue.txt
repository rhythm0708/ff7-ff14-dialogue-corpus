Welcome, welcome! Have a browse and let me know when you're ready to order.
You're here on that lady's recommendation as well, I take it?
I had been wondering what the Endless do for sustenance, so it seemed a good opportunity to learn.
Oho, this is your first time eating, is it?
The food here is created using aether and memory data. To us, it tastes just like the real thing.
So, how about it? Would you care for some popcorn?
Let's give it a try, shall we?
That's the spirit! Find a table you like, and I'll bring it right out. And lest you worry, there's no chargeâ”€all the food is free here.
Food created with memory data... How will this taste to the living, I wonder.
Well, as they say, there's only one way to find out!
Well, as they say, there's only one way to find out!
Good gods... It tastes like nothing at all...
Er, I-I mean...it's amazing! I've never had such tasty popcorn!
Hehe, it's not our best seller for nothing!
And what about you?
Hahaha! It's always special, watching newcomers eat for the first time!
They're just like the people of Everkeep.
Their communal spirit, their delighted smiles. Exactly the same...
Thank you for your custom. Come again any time!
By the way, prior to this, a young man caught my eye near the canal. He appeared to be searching for something, and rather frantically.
Did you perchance see him too?
No? I must say I'm curious as to what has him so flustered. Could you help me look for the fellow?
My thanks. Let's head to where I saw him.
'Twould seem he is no longer in the vicinity.
Let us keep looking. Whatever it is that troubles him, perhaps we can be of assistance.
I cannot claim to know exactly how Endless behave, but hopefully our man has not gone far.
Let us split up to search for him. He is an Eldite with fair hair.
