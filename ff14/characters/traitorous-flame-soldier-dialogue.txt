Ahahahahaha!
I'm afraid your little ambush ends here!
I eluded the Immortal Flames' clutches for moons before finally being caught. Did you not wonder how I managed it?
'Twas almost as if someone was feedin' him information from the inside! Gahahaha!
Aye, your every movement was known to me ahead of time! Hee hee hee!
Now, as much as I'd love to chat awhile, I have appointments to keep.
They're all yours!
Hee hee! Our Amalj'aa friends will keep you company!
Filthy traitors! When I get my hands on you...
Hee hee! How long will you last, I wonder!?
Another wave! Stay sharp, men!
Godsdammit, is there no end to them!?
Hee hee! The show is only just beginning!
Put up your weapon, or your comrade's a dead man!
Behind you!
Bring her.
The rest of you, march!
Traitorous scum...
I fear the Amalj'aa mean to give us to their god as an offering. If I must die, then let me die a soldier's deathâ”€with steel in hand!
