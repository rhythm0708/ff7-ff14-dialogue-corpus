You! Yes, you, you idiot! Have you seen an envelope lying about?
This imbecile refuses to give me the alchemic I ordered without that bloody slip of parchment!
Unless your friends have a spell to make me remember where I dropped my damned envelope, I doubt they'll be more help than you... And you've wasted enough of my time already!
