You're learning about the Hhetsarro way of life, are you?
I may have a thing or two to share... But rather than talking your ear off, let me test your powers of deduction. I find answers much easier to recall later if I arrived at them myself.
Ahem! Our hhetso provide us with something that we use in medicines, poultices, and soap, to drive away pests, and to sustain our fires. What is it?
Both horns and hooves have cores of bone, and we use all of these materials, albeit primarily in tent-poles, instruments, and the like. It's not quite the answer I was looking for!
To remind you: this material is fit for medicines, poultices, and soap, to drive away pests and other evils, to sustain fires, and to flavor food. Have another guess!
Alas, not quite! Meat and organs both can be made into delicious fare, and our neighbors are oft glad to trade for them. They do have certain medicinal uses as well, but they aren't fit for all the purposes mentioned in my question.

It sounds like there's a story there...but that is indeed the correct answer! We've discovered myriad uses for rroneek chips over time, each a boon to our way of life. Where there is a need, our hhetso always provide.
I know city folk are squeamish about dung, but you can't deny generations of results. I won't ask that you march across the plains and fill a sack with itâ”€only that you keep an open mind about our customs.
