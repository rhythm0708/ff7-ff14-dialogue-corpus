Who goes there!?
Uwaaah! Th-That's Glagg, chief of the Goggs!
You! You're one of the Tholls!
I see, I see... Word was our miners were comin' back drowsy, one after the next. I immediately suspected foul play...
And what should I find here but Tholl scum skulkin' about! It's a spineless act befittin' your limp beards!
What!? I won't stand for that insult!
Our beards are soft and luscious and smell like freshly tapped ale! Gogg beards are dry and crusty and smell like a knocker's arse!
Impudent whelp! Better a hobgoblin's nose hairs than the feeble, floppy things you Tholls have hangin' from your faces!
