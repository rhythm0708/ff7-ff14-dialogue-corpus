You sell? No... No, you are no merchant. But then, why do I know your face? Hm...
Oh, I remember! You spent Voeburt gold!
Such a coinpurse cracking! You are already a legend among Mord traders!
You're a traveling merchant, then. Can you tell us anything of this village?
Of course, anything for valued customers!
This place is Garik. Before the Flood, it was home to many miners. After, not so many. Now, none.
So Master Ghen Gen borrowed the village─made it into a trading post. Very convenient location!
In which case, you all must be familiar with the local roads, correct?
We're on our way to Nabaath Areng, ourselves. If we continue south from here, will we have any difficulties reaching it?
Oh, yes! Great difficulty...
The Flood rent the stone and crushed the mines surrounding Nabaath Areng. Only steep cliffs and collapsed tunnels remain.
Oh, no...
But surely there must be some way. Do you think any of the other Mord might have some sort of hidden route?
Perhaps. You ask, they tell. Tell for free, even, to friends of our best customer.
Wonderful! Thank you for your help.
Well then, “best customer,” let's see what information your reputation buys us.
