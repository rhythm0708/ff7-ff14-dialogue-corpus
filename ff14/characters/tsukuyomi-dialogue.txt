I knew you would not flee. I see now the strength which flows from that baleful light of yours.
But I am become Tsukuyomi, goddess of the moon and divinity of night. What power can compare to such celestial majesty!?
I shall plunge all I despise into darkness! And within that black abyss, even your light shall flicker and fail.
Come, let us cast the stalks and look upon the fate of Doma. I see a future in which the sun sets on this wretched land once and for all!
Oh...it's going to be a long night.
Let's share the torment, shall we...?
Enough of that.I wouldn't want the pain to grow familiar.
Struggle all you wishâ”€I encourage it!Your death will be all the sweeter...
Why does it fade away...?
...Ah. I understand.It feeds on my spite. On my suffering...
Come forth, shades of the dead! Curse my name!Strike my body! Fill my soul with blackest malice!
Come forth, shades of the dead! Curse my name!Strike my body! Fill my soul with blackest malice!
