Well met, friend. What brings you to Revenant's Toll?
...Did I hear you rightly? Your friends are being held captive at Castrum Centri, and you want to rescue them? I don't mean to discourage you, but that might prove...difficult.
The stronghold has been on high alert of late, with armored patrols seen about the perimeter around the clock. Not even a fly could get within a hundred yalms of the walls undetected.
If the Garleans were alerted to our coming, we cannot know what they will do to Minfilia and the others. We must act with the greatest stealth.
Aye, it has to be good old-fashioned infiltration.
But with security so tight, how are we going to smuggle ourselves in?
Why, I've a mind to walk through the front door.
Huh? The front door?
Aye, we'll disguise ourselves as imperial troops and march right in.
For this, we'll need a few sets of imperial uniforms, a suit of magitek armor, and impeccable timing.
Heh, that's a bold strategy, but it just might work. Where we are, there's certainly no shortage of opportunities to borrow the equipment.
Knowing those imperial bastards, they won't even suspect that we savage Eorzeans would think to use their technology.
Then it's settled!
If you're determined to go ahead with this, I'd recommend you speak with Glaumunt.
The fellow's got a personal grudge against the Empire, and happens to know a deal about Castrum Centri besides. I've no doubt that he'd want to be of aid.
Yda and I shall go to reconnoiter Garlean activity at the stronghold. It would not do if something were to befall our comrades before we had the chance to act.
Come and join us when you're ready, Forename! Let's do this!
Sometimes I wonder, Yda... Are there ever times when you are not enthused?
I'm nothing if not enthused, Y'shtola! And you're beginning to remind me of Papalymo!
