F-Fresh fish for Captain Baldewyn? Of course, of course! We will do our best, madam.
U-Unfortunately, we've had a poor catch in recent days on account of the rough seas. More boats should be returning soon, but I cannot promise that their catch will please.
But don't worry, milady! The captain will have his fish! I swear it!
