Tell you what happened? Why, yes, of course! I am quite recovered enough for that! Anything to help catch those cowardly blackhearts!
I was traveling my usual route to Whitebrim Front when a sudden blow sent me reeling...
The next thing I knew I was on the ground, and several heretics were rifling through my cargo─arms, armor, crystals...they were taking everything.
'Twas then that one of them noticed my bleary gaze, and stalked over to better acquaint my head with his mace. Before darkness claimed me, however, I distinctly heard the words, “return to Snowcloak.”
I daresay that is where they were hauling my goods, but you'll not catch me rushing off in pursuit! They tell me 'twas a miracle I survived at all, and I'll not trust my thick skull to save me a second time!
Gah! Draw your weapon, foul─ Wait, I recognize you, adventurer. You are come seeking heretics?
Then we share a common purpose. We were on patrol when we chanced across one of their raiding parties, and pursued them here.
By rights, we should have had them cornered in this ravine...and yet, they are gone. Vanished, like icy wraiths.
