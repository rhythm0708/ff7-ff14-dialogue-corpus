Yes? You look as though you have something to say. Do you?
Then you have come to the wrong place, for we of House Haillenarte bear the rose. Mayhap you should journey to Gridania? I believe an ancient Duskwight house was said to use the white lily as its sigil.

Lord Haurchefant of House Fortemps commands the garrison at Camp Dragonhead. Present to him this letter of introduction, and he will surely be receptive to your needs.
