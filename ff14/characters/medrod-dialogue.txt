P-Please leave me be... I'm not long for this world...
I...I looked death in the face... 'Tis only a matter of time before he comes for me, just like he came for that poor woman...

...Y-You're right. It's not as bad as it seems. I saw something terrible, that's true, but that hardly means I'm going to suffer the same fate. Thanks to you, I can think straight again. I believe I can even recount what I saw without losing it.
It was just another ordinary day. I was headed back to the Float when I noticed a suspicious character in the distanceâ”€a masked man garbed head to toe in black. He had a hideous fiend in tow, a winged creature that was all eyeball and jagged teeth. Taken by curiosity, I crept as near as I dared...
...To see the corpse of a woman! One glimpse was enough to tell me that she'd died a gruesome death!
In that instant, I knew right away that the masked man was a minion of Thal, come to claim her soul for His realm.
What!? You're investigating this same masked man!?
