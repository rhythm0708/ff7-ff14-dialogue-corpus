Aspirants are reminded not to approach the figures of the Pale Harvest without express permission. They should be treated with no less reverence than Galatea herself, and are hardly less dangerous.Only those who have successfully forged a pact with an avatar may spar with the Galatea Parva. They will serve to refine one's use of invocations and tactical coordination.The Galatea Magna, however, is reserved for those who are able to serve as host to their avatar. This periculous manikin is designed to push a reaper to their limits, if not beyond them.Learn to walk in death's shadow, and you shall know no fear.
<creeeak> Ready your scythe!
This will <snap> warm you up.
