General Aldynn is inside, aye. Will you be joining him?
What news? You spoke with Fordola, I take it?
Yes. As expected, she didn't say very much, but it wasn't a total waste of time. Arenvald noticed something odd about her. He thinks she might be having visions almost constantly, which is not how the Echo normally works. Have you found anything here which might explain why it's so different for her?
Hmph. We've been hard-pressed just to organize the research materials, let alone study them. To be frank, I'd welcome the Scions' expert assistance, if you have time to lend a hand.
