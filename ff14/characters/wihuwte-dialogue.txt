Give me strength...
For the last time, the investigation is closed. There's no refuting the evidence.
I don't give a shit about your evidence, you lying scum! You release my friends, or I'll make you wish you had!
Let me remind you who the scum is here.
Your friends, who had the temerity to point their firearms at me, the deputy chief of the Dustwatch.
And after taking them into custody, what should we discover but incontrovertible proof that they had committed larceny.
They will not be released until they've paid for their crimes.
I'd heard a peacekeeping force had been formed to deal with growing lawlessness. Seems the situation is bad indeed.
