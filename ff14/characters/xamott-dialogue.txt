Lali-ho!
What sorry excuse for a greeting was that!? Where's you heart, lass!? Your stones!?
It's a greeting, lass! A lali-ho for a lali-ho─that's the way it works!
Come, let's try it again!
Lali-hoooooo!
Hmmm, not bad, not bad. But there's room for improvement.
Anyroad, now that we've observed common courtesy─who are you and what're you doin' here?
At the recommendation of the denizens of Amity, we have come to seek the aid of the Tholl family. May we speak with Chief Xamott?
Why, yes you may! I am Xamott, and I bid you welcome to Tomra!
If it's the folk of Amity what sent you here, you must have quite a tale to tell. Come, let's hear it!
Well, well! And there I thought those below had no fight left in 'em!
Havin' said that, it's not like we know how to deal with that floatin' volcano and all them sin eaters neither.
If you're serious about restorin' peace to these parts, though, we'll gladly lend you a hand.
However!
The kind of ore you seek's precious to us too.
If I let you have it only for you to bungle things up and squander it, like, no amount of ale will wash away my chagrin.
First, I need to make sure you're worthy─by means of a trial! Aye, a trial most tricksy, passed down through the line of Tholl!
And what is this trial?
Heh heh heh... Come with me and I'll tell you all.
Heh heh heh... Listen well.
As you know, we're a minin' folk. And in the minin' life, danger's a constant companion.
So, when we come of age, each of us must prove our readiness to take to the mines.
This we do by undertakin' a trial what tests the three traits all good miners can't do without: discernment, diligence, and dexterity. We call it...3-D MineRunner!
Now, look on my helm. Mark its features well. You'll be given a slingshot, which you must use to shoot dwarves as wear helms what are different.
I've already made the necessary arrangements. When you're ready to take the trial, report to the observer nearby. Best of luck to you!
