Ye found yer way to 'Awkers' Alley, friend. ...Hm? A Qiqirn what worked at the Druthers? Aye, ye speak of Teteroon.
Related to that Kyokyoroon bloke just o'er there by some blood or another. Two of 'em put in together an' were makin' good coin. But ol' Teteroon up an' left Limsa not long ago. Couldn't say as to why or where.
Yer better off askin' Kyokyoroon himself. He can be tight of lip, though, I warn ye. Best to take this chicken egg with ye. Li'l bastard loves the bloody things.
Heh... Good to hear about ol' Busc, though. Sounds as though he ain't changed a bit. Just like him to send a 'venturer along. Too shy to come his own self. Gods, I miss drinkin' with that fool.
