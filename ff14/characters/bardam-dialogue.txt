Yea, you who would walk after Bardam! He who was strong as the earth, swift as a horse, brave as the thunder!
You who would become Warriors of the Steppe!With death will you dance!
The first trial is upon you...
Be not deceived by demons...
Nothing to it!
The second trial is upon you...
Be not tempted to rest, but fly across the Steppe as the wind...
It certainly kept us on our toes!
The third trial is upon you... Be not afraid of falling stars...
Yea, you worthy successors of Bardam! Yours is the Steppe and everything in it!
Whew, such a scramble that was...
After that dip, I'm glad for the warmth of the torches.
This bird motif...
I daresay we are come to the yol's nest!
'Twould seem we've reached the path's end.
Well fought back there, Forename. Things got hairy at times, but I knew we'd manage!
Oh, right. I've still got those whistles Cirina gave me.
Here's yours. I suppose we ought to give them a try like she said.
Up there, look!
I think that means we've won them over. That one there is yours, right? The other one is mine. Awww...
So that's that, then! We're officially warriors of the Steppe!
Well, we've done what we came to do. Let's head back to Mol Iloh.
That massive monstrosity was quite the surprise, was it not? Who knew that the Steppe held such secrets!
And with that, there is naught left to prevent us from taking part in the Naadam.
