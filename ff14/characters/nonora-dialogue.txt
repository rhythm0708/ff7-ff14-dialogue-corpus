Greetings, adventurer! Are you here to test your skills in the excitement of Kupo Kupo Adventure?
Excellent, let's get you started at once! Please enjoy yourself!
Kupo Kupo Adventure is a glamour-generated game in which you control a moogle armed with a magicked rebounding ball, and do battle with hordes of fiends.
The game was apparently developed by a fun-loving engineer. I don't know the individual personally, I'm afraid, but it is my pleasure to attend to those who wish to play.
If you have a spare moment, then by all means give it a try!
A-About myself? Well, there isn't much to tell. I'm but an ordinary citizen of Ul'dah.
I had previously assisted the wandering minstrel for the Rising, and was asked to do so again. Suffice it to say I'm suitably compensated for my services.
