Pshkohhh... Uplander is mistaken. Sharlayan has new keepers, is on cusp of new age of glory!
Goblins? Here to plunder the city!?
<gasp> Uplander is mistaken muchly! We are not thieves! This place is our home!
Your home? When last I looked, it was mine and Alphinaud's. We were born here.
Pssshmph! When uplanders abandoned city, uplanders gave up claim. Born here or no, uplanders are trespassers!
My friends, please. We did not come to dispute your claim to this land. Our purpose here is peaceful: we desire but to cross the river.
Be calm, I beg you, and let us speak like the civilized folk that we are. Surely we can come to a mutual understanding.
Pssshkoh... If that is truth, then uplanders are welcome here. Come with Slowfixâ”€Slowfix will show uplanders settlement.
Pshkohhh... Here is heart of settlement, name of Idyllshire!
