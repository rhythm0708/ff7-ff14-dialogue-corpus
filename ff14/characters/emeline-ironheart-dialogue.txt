Goodness gracious. This is the first time I've experienced such a tragedy...
Godsdammit... What is Zoraal Ja trying to achieve by slaughtering his own people!?
That he's still bent on surpassing Papa is clear, but why this massacre? I don't understand...
Right now we can only guess at his intent, but his obsession must be strong indeed to endure after thirty years...
But now isn't the time to ponder such things. The people need our help.
I've been thinking... By wearing regulators, the people of Alexandria had been spared the fear of death.
That's because the device not only resurrects you─it also erases your memories of the departed. The very notion of dying would have become vague, if not forgotten.
To be killed over and over... I can't imagine how traumatized the survivors must be. Even if they're not physically hurt, they would still need care.
At a time like this, the citizens need their queen to console them. But where has she gone?
I don't know. There are other districts, so perhaps she's checking on them.
In any case, it's too much for her to handle alone...
Countless people will be distraught, and we ought to provide them with what comfort we can.
So while Cahciua and her crew tend to those with physical injuries, let's seek out those whose wounds are emotional.
Understood. If you and Forename want to concentrate on True Vue, the rest of us will see to the other areas.
Sounds like a plan. Alright, everyone─we'll meet up in the Backroom after.
