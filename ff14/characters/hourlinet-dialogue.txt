Hail, Forename. As you can see, Lord Francel yet lives. We must try to reason with the inquisitor─but if his guards judge us a threat, we must also be prepared to defend ourselves.
Joacin Charlemend Francel de Haillenarte─you stand accused of heresy against the Holy See of Ishgard. Is there aught you wish to say in your defense?
Hear me, brothers─these charges are false! The men and women of my line have ever opposed the Dravanians, and I am no different! Since the very birth of our nation, we have gladly shed blood in service to the Holy See! Condemn me and you will strike a blow for the enemies of Ishgard!
It is for Halone to judge if you speak the truth.
Prove your innocence in the eyes of gods and men. Leap from the cliff and entrust your fate to the Fury.
The righteous shall take their place in Halone's halls, while the wicked shall reveal their drachen forms and be put to the sword!
In the name of House Fortemps, I beseech you─stay your hand!
Inquisitor, we are come on behalf of Lord Haurchefant. My lord has uncovered evidence which suggests that the charges against Lord Francel are without merit.
We humbly request that these proceedings be suspended until such time as a full reexamination of the facts has been conducted.
Lord Haurchefant has allowed his personal relationship with the accused to cloud his judgment. That he should harbor private doubts, I might have allowed...but that he would dare interfere in legal proceedings sanctioned by the Holy See, I cannot.
To defy the will of an inquisitor is to commit heresy! A crime for which there is but one punishment!
We must hold them until Lord Haurchefant arrives, Forename! And remember─no harm can come to the inquisitor!
