Heading to the survey site, madam? It's on the eastern shore of the lake, and the swiftest way to get there is by boat.
Look how many people there are!
Should we get to it, then? Pick up anything that seems the least bit “device” like, and we'll make ourselves a pile.
Well if it isn't the hero of the hour! Maybe you'll change our luck─we've found bugger all without you.
Biggs! Wedge!
Aye, aye, well we could hardly say no to a call for aid from the Scions.
Jessie collared the chief for some other business, so we'll be working twice as hard to make up for his not being here.
Thrice as hard, even!
Thank you─both of you! I'm sure we'll find that beacon in no time!
Hm. I'm not seeing anything out here.
D'you reckon you could squeeze in there, Wedge?
And get stuck halfway!? No thank you.
I could try if you like!
Tataru, no! We couldn't ask you to do that!
Oh, I'll be fine. This receptionist is not afraid to get her hands dirty.
...Hm, what's that you got there?
Now that looks promising!
Uhh...isn't that the Ironworks' symbol? ...Counterfeiters?
Now...now I have you!
You all right?
What's happening!?
Stay with me! Focus on my voice!
Let expanse contract, eon become instant...
...Wait, this must be it! The device! This is supposed to happen!
Throw wide the gates that we may pass!
Safe journey, Warrior of Light. Find our friends, and bring them home!
