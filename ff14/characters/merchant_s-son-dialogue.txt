Aaah...aaah...no!
Faaa...grrraaaaaaghhh!
Vrtra... Our people... You must save them!
My son...he...he... The satrap!
Enough! You must run, for their sake and your own!
Yes. You will survive. You must.
Be strong, my friends!
Fear not, for we will defeat these abominations!
Brave men and women of the Radiant Host! Lend Y'shtola and Thancred your aid! Let not a single beast escape!
The rest of you, flee this place! Carry the wounded if you must! Head indoors, or underground!
Above all, stay calm. No beasts will follow you─we will see to that.
Alphinaud! Alisaie! Leave the city to us, and make for Palaka's Stand at once!
Matsya, show my friends to the village. I promise you─they're more capable than the Host's finest.
R-Right!
Go with them, will you?
We will save these people─as many as we can!
We meet again. You...you do remember me, yes?
You saved my skin twice over in Yedlihmad. And now I find myself turning to you for help once more... But let us tarry here no longer!
Damn it all... Staying calm isn't exactly my forte...
We must save Palaka's Stand. Whatever it takes.
Matsya. It pains me to put you into harm's way, but I would ask your aid as well.
O-Of course! Palaka's Stand is not far, just down that hill.
But as I told His Excellency before, the path was blocked by terrible creatures. I had no choice but to turn back.
In that case, this is what we shall do...
Forename. I ask that you take the lead and dispatch any beasts you encounter.
Alisaie and I will keep Matsya hidden amidst the trees, and follow when the path is clear.
There is no telling what dangers await us. Keep your eyes peeled.
