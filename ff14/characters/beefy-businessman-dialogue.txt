Hey! Don't sneak up on me like that! Are ye tryin' to make me soil me breeches!?
Hm? Yer here for the job, are ye? Well, I hope ye've experience dismantlin' golems.
We've been gatherin' reports o' some never-afore-seen constructs what've begun showin' up all over the damn realm.
Nary a soul knows what the creatures are made of, so Amajina & Sons means to be the first to take a pickaxe to this mystery mother lode!
I need ye to get out there, take apart one o' them shamblin' piles o' bricks, an' bring me back a good size chunk o' the remainin' rubble. What do ye say, eh? Will ye give it a shot?
No!? Surely, ye can't pass up this once-in-a-lifetime chance!
Good lasslad! I'll have a nice “refreshing” reward for ye when ye get back!
Have ye taken a sample of one o' them odd golems?
Ooh, now ain't that special! That luster... That shine...
Can ye smell it? 'Tis the scent o' profit, my friend!
That's some fine work ye did, adventurer. Very fine, indeed.
Now, just as I promised ye, I've prepared a payment yer sure to enjoy!
Don't be shy now, lasslad. We all need a bit o' pamperin' from time to time!
