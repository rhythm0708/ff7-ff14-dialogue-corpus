Many years have passed since we installed a message board on an unassuming street corner. To see it continue to be utilized by adventurers fills me and my fellow keepers with pride.
Like a lodestone, the message board draws people together, and it is our hope that it keeps serving you well as a means to share information.
For our humble part, we shall endeavor to maintain the board in good repair while bringing you news that may be of interest.With best wishes,A Message Board Keeper
