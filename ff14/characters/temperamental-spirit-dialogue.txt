We and the star were fulfilled...
Wanted for naught, mourned for naught...
So why... Why did it have to end!?
The Final Days taught us to fear a death forced upon us.
The injustice of duties and dreams left unfulfilled. The grief of unexpected partings...
Swift as darkness, cold as ash.
Such tragedy, yet no catharsis! Such truth, yet no consolation...
Such tragedy, yet no catharsis! Such truth, yet no consolation...
Such tragedy, yet no catharsis! Such truth, yet no consolation...
Such tragedy, yet no catharsis! Such truth, yet no consolation...
Such tragedy, yet no catharsis! Such truth, yet no consolation...
Such tragedy, yet no catharsis! Such truth, yet no consolation...
