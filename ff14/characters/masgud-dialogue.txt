How urgent this business must be to leave our conversation unfinished!
The kinsai. Will you buy it? There is but one bundle left. If not, thenâ”€
I will, I will! Though I had not thought to pay so high a price...
It is a bargain for which you should be grateful. If you lack the coin, then the fault is your own, and you will leave with nothing.
Please, I must have the kinsai! The gods themselves requested it! We are bound to their will!
...Pay me the difference in whisperroot. I will sell it to the next apothecary to pass through Reunion, and we will each feel fairly treated.
But do not tarry. Should another come before you, coin in hand, I will not refuse him.
I understand. Thank you for this kindness!
I am sorry, but we must speak of Hien later. I cannot leave Reunion without that kinsai...
You...you want to help me, is that it?
I do not know what to say... Thank you, Forename, thank you!
The lumbering ones we must fell wander the plains to the west of Reunion. If we each harvest two, then we should have enough whisperroot.
Return here when you have finished. Good luck!
Welcome back, Forename. Have you brought the whisperroot?
Blessed is he who shows kindness to strangers, for with fortune does he ever ride.
Will this quantity suffice?
It shall. The kinsai is yours.
The gods favor you more than you know, child. Udgan rarely have need of such herbs, and so my stock is limited. Had you come a day earlier or later, I would have none for you.
Perhaps the gods guided me here, as they guided Grandmother. As they guided this woman from the West...
Hey! How goes the search? Any luck?
Ho, what fortune to meet a friend of the young master!
Well met, Cirina. If you have an inkling as to the current whereabouts of Lord Hien, we should be most grateful for your assistance.
Oh, please... It is I who should be grateful.
