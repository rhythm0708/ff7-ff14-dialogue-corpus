Ah, you're Forename Surname of the Scions? My thanks for coming, friend. We're stronger for your assistance.
Allow me to brief you on our mission. Our objective is to capture Amalj'aa and prise from them the whereabouts of the abductees.
The lizardmen aren't aware that their man, Ungust, has been exposed. When they come to the rendezvous point to meet the traitor, we'll spring the trap.
Owing to the clandestine nature of the mission, we can deploy only a small contingent. Every member must count, and so we requested the aid of the Scions.
The rendezvous will take place at the Invisible City. Please make your way there and lie in wait.
We stand to learn much and more of the Amalj'aa plot if the mission succeeds, Forename. Let's make sure it does.
Is the bait in place?
