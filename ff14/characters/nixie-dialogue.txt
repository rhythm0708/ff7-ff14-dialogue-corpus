Tee hee hee! Let's play, let's play!
Water, water, become spears.♪Things of flesh and bone to pierce.♪
Water, water, flow so swift.♪Wash away and set adrift.♪
Ahahaha, such fun! More water! We need more water!
Noooooo, all my water is gone! But I can't lose! I won't!
Hmph! Why won't you get hit!?
<whimper> All right, all right, I give up... You win...
Ahhh, to have closure after all these years...
Wait... Was it you who created that familiar!?
The water is flowing again, ribbit! Let us head back!
Last but not least, we need to fire up the kiln.
Ugh, I'm freezing in my sodden clothes...
Worry not, you will be warm again soon. Very warm.
Master Matoya will be getting impatient─assuming she hasn't fallen asleep.
