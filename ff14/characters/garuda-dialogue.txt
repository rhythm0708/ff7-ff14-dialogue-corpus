Who dares intrude upon my sanctuary!?
Your insolence shall not go unpunished, landwalkers!
Twelve preserve...she's...she's huge!
As I live and breathe...
Over there─look.
Amalj'aa and kobold prisoners. But why would the Ixal bring them here...?
Heehee HAHA hahaha HEEHEE haha HEEEEEE!!!
Wherefore come you hither, foolish mortals!?
Garuda! We are come to put an end to your reign of terror!
Hear you this blasphemy, my children? These landwalkers would bring me low!
You who are bound to crawl upon the earth should revere me─FOR I AM THE WIND!
Did we not take to the skies, and slip your defenses!? We are bound by nothing, Garuda!
You think your playthings give you strength?
They will not help you here, landwalker. This is my realm, where none can challenge my supremacy! Struggle though you may─I shall slake the roots with your blood, and festoon the canopy with your ENTRAILS! HAHAHAHAHAAA!
Squaaawk! Slay the unfeathered ones, we shall! As an offering to Garuda, they will serve!
Leave the Ixal to us, Forename! We will keep them distracted while you deal with her!
Do not fail, Forename! Remember: you fight for the Scions! For Eorzea!
This worm would die by mine own hand! Come, then...I shall grant you that which you seek!
Heehee HAHA hahaha HEEHEE haha HEEEEEE!!!
Together, we can weather this storm!
Quickly─take cover!
Soon you will see the depths of your folly, mortals!
THE RECKONING COMES!!!
There is no escape! No hope! NONE!!!
My power... No...
No... Nooo! NO! NO!!!
What!? How in the hells─!?
HAHAHAHAHAAA! This...is...MY REALM! You have no hope here! None! NONNNE!!!
Did you truly believe you could defy a god, landwalkers!?
My power is limitless! My children legion!
And they have rendered unto me a wealth of crystals.
Their gifts sustain me, their faith empowers me!
None save my children will escape the reckoning, mortals! And those who would use my crystals to waken the rest shall realize the folly of their faith!
Then all shall worship none but me! The one true god! HEE HEE HEE HEE HEEEEEE!!!
...Of course! Worship! So long as the Ixal keep praying, she will never fall!
Then let's stop them!
Ugh!
HAHA hahaha HEEHEE heehee HAHAHA!!!No harm will come to you, my children!
This is only the beginning, landwalkers! All who oppose me shall suffer for their defiance!
Soon, the worms of the forest shall receive my judgment! The desert vermin next─their walls of stone will not shield them from the tempest!
And then will I take vengeance on the sea lice! Their wooden boats cannot outrun the wind!
Tremble, mortals, for I shall visit you all in time! And all shall be mine! ALL MIIINE!!!
You, landwalker─you who dared to raise your hand against me─you shall be the first to pay for your sins! Not with your death─but with your LIFE!
You will serve me, landwalker...to your last breath!
No, NO!!! I claimed you! You should be MINE!
What...what are you? What have you done to me!?
No mortal should possess such power! This...this is impossible!
Why do you not tremble at my might? Why do you not beg for mercy!? Why do you not DIE!?
We've done it!
Is that all!?
O Lady of the Vortex! O mighty Garuda!
Of all primals, the most terrible. I say again...IS─THAT─ALL!?
Gaius!?
Ah, Cid, my boy. You look well─for one who has forsaken kin and country. I wonder, what else you will forsake before the day is done.
What!?
What exactly did you hope to accomplish here this day?
I...
Well, I shall accomplish far more!
...Is that all? IS THAT ALL!?
Insolent mortal! I shall make you suffer!
That foul stench... I see now... She has touched you!
Very well...
Seven hells, does she still mean to fight!?
