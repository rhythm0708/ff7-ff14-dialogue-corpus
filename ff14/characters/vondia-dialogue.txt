Ah, a newly come traveler. Allin chi'si, and welcome to Slitherbough.
You must forgive us if we seem strangely reserved. We are a quiet and taciturn people.
Silent and serene as the sunless sea. The quiet makes it easy to discern the presence of eaters and other dangers here in the woods.
allin tuta
