Apologies for the trouble I've caused.
So long as this body holds, I shall fight with you!
'Tis but a flesh wound!
It's building up energy! Have care!
For queen and country!
It gathers lightning to itself!
Let's split up and deal with them!
Hmph! Not holding anything back, are we?
Hmph! Not holding anything back, are we?
Leave this to me!
Behold the bladework of a royal knight!
Is it over...?
Dare I hope...?
Dare I hope...?
Such tremendous lightning!
So many... This is going to be tough.
So many... This is going to be tough.
Oh no...
Watch out!
I...cannot move...
I...cannot move...
Not good... At this rate...
Upon mine honor, we shall weather this storm!
Now! Lay the fiend low!
Otis, you must stop! Your body can't survive this!
Nay, I cannot yield...even should it cost me my life!
Otiiis!
Otiiis!
Otiiis!
Otiiis!
My queen... Are you unharmed?
Otis...
Thank you, Lord Captain. For the delicious repast. For everything.
The old units do not have regulators. Their souls cannot be recovered.
He is gone... The Otis who so valiantly fought for us...
I'm truly grateful for your help. Would that I had the time to thank you properly...
But I'm afraid I cannot linger.
There are urgent duties I must perform.
Hey, wait!
Is everyone all right!?
We're fine, but Otis is...
So he's the one who was looking after Gulool Ja...
Thanks to you, Solution Nine has been spared the worst, but the situation on the other levels is grim.
We're currently assessing the full extent of the casualties. In the meantime, could you help us treat the wounded?
Thank you, Otis... I pray your soul is at peace.
I did not expect that such carnage would unfold here...
To slaughter his adopted people too... Is there no end to his villainy?
I was scared out of my wits when the machines started attacking, and I'm still shaking... But seeing you makes me feel better. Thanks for coming by.
We've managed to seal off access routes on all levels. Any remaining soldiers should be contained now.
We couldn't have done it without you and yours out there fighting. Thank you.
