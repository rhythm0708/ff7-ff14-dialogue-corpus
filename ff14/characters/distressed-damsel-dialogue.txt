M-Mama... Wh-Where are you? <sniff>
I thought this would be a fine opportunity to accrue some appreciation, but the poor girl is beside herself─she keeps calling out for her “Mama”... Might I enlist your help?
This must be the lost lass we've been looking for. If we want to earn her thanks, we'll need to reunite her with her mother, wouldn't you say?
Which means we now have a lady to locate... Any suggestions?
Ah. You're saying that the mother will be worried about her daughter having gone missing? Brilliant! This is exactly why I had you accompany me! Right then...
I know I can't keep relying on you, but just thinking about having to think for myself is making me anxious...
Ah, that's it: anxiety! That's how one would feel having misplaced their offspring, right? Then that's the emotion I need to find...
Come, say something! Your silence is making me anxious...
Ah, anxiety! I imagine that's how one would feel having lost their daughter! Hmm, let's see...
Found her! I don't know which is the bigger boon, having you by my side, or this fancy finery.
I think I've learned my way around the city, more or less. I'll handle this next part on my own. Wait here, I'll be back with the girl's mother in no time!
