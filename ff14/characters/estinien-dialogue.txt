...You flatter me overmuch, Lord Commander.
So, you are the adventurer of whom they spoke...I see now why my blood fair sang in anticipation of our meeting.
...Well, now that we have all been introduced, let us proceed to the matter at hand. I would share with you what we have learned of Iceheart's design, as confessed by the heretics taken captive after the assault on the gates.
'Twould seem that Lady Iceheart and the Dravanians share a common goal─the reclamation of Nidhogg's stolen eye.
Nidhogg...One of the seven great wyrms.
His name features prominently in your nation's history. Though once defeated by the hero Haldrath, the beast is said to have terrorized Coerthas since Ishgard's founding.
Aye, many are the scars our walls bear from Nidhogg's relentless efforts to raze the city.
The trophy Haldrath plucked from the bested wyrm's skull─known simply as “the Eye”─is a treasured relic of Ishgard, and one possessed of untold power.
Should it ever be returned to Nidhogg, the dread creature would be restored to the height of his strength. ...And then no wall or ward we could erect would be stout enough to deny him.
