The Dawnservant awaits you within. While I was not informed of the reason for your audience, in terms of attire, I would suggest full battle regalia.
Forgive me this sudden summons.
When I learned my daughter's champion was back in the city, I couldn't resist the opportunity.
And they call me Head of Resolve for good reason─old as I am, I have not lost a battle worthy of the name since the day I took the throne.
And I've been craving a proper challenge. The lance-wielder, Estinien, he fought well enough...but our bout was ended before a victor could be decided.
Judging by the sailors' gossip, you are a warrior of renown in your homeland.
Yet I wonder─with all your deeds done and victories won...
Are you warrior enough to stand against me?
A spirited answer! Why not, indeed!
Not even the slightest hint of fear... I knew you were no pretender.
Do you think me unworthy? I'll soon change your mind!
The battle rage is upon me! I'll stop short of killing you, of course...but expect no other mercies!
Come! Ready your arms and show me the truth of the tales!
Give it your all─I want a fight to remember!
Let's test the waters!
You can do better than that!
They didn't even blink.
Have you ever fought a viper?
I see you know the viper style...
Hah! Let's see how you handle this!
The spearman did not lie. Very well, then!
Resolve and Reason kindle...
Oh, right.
Hah! Did you think you had my measure?
Take this!
Still holding up?
We're far from finished!
No more holding back!
Stay alert!
Hyaaah!
You fight well indeed!
Hah!
You really are formidable!
Now we'll see what you're truly made of...
Hraaaaaargh!
That will do! You've shown me more than enough!
I've brought my full strength to bear against opponents before, but you are the first to withstand it.
Even with my Head of Reason asleep, I never expected you to give me so much trouble...
Estinien did not exaggerate: you are a force to be reckoned with!
Now, a confession. I said I craved a challenge, and that was no lie...but I had another reason for calling you here.
I had to judge for myself if you were fit to attend my beloved daughter.
In some respects, she is much like me: hot-headed and prone to rush into danger.
But one With your adamant defense could shield Lamaty'i from those who would do her harm.
But one with your healing touch could sustain Lamaty'i even as she contends with the most fearsome of foes.
But one with your talents could readily dispatch the threats that bar Lamaty'i's way.
Will you hear my question and answer me plainly? Address me not as the ruler of Tuliyollal, but a concerned father.
Thank you.
Then tell me, given your journey together thus far, what is your impression of Lamaty'i?
Whether it be as Third Promise, or just a companion on the road. Speak your mind.
A tactful response. But agreed: she is not ready for the throne. Not yet.
Well, I did ask you to speak your mind. But agreed: she is not ready for the throne. Not yet.
Lamaty'i thinks she understands our many peoples─their histories, their cultures, their beliefs. But she knows only what she's seen in the capital.
And it's not only her who concerns me. Even this early in the contest, you must have realized...
As potential rulers, all four claimants are lacking.
This is why I elected to hold the rite of succession─not to choose a fitting candidate, but to cultivate one.
And if no one has impressed me by the end of it, then to no one will I yield my throne.
As a parent, I pray that my children rise to the occasion...
With outsiders dragged into my game, I am also hopeful that the different perspectives you and your companions have to offer will inspire them to grow.
I imagine you in particular have traveled many lands. Known many peoples and cultures─loved them and been loved in turn.
Guide Lamaty'i as you think best. Walk at her side and, when needed, push her to walk ahead.
I knew it!
There I was, about to sit down for some of Namikka's cooking, when I heard that Papa had sent for you.
You were dueling behind my back, weren't you!
I see there is no point in denying it!
You needn't worry, Daughter: I took care not to inflict lasting injuries.
You and your ally may return to the contest without disadvantage. No harm done!
I swear, just as I was learning newfound respect for my father...
Let's take our leave of this battle-mad oaf before he calls on the rest of my entourage.
Watch over her, champion.
Koana's recruits are no less sharp─as one might expect of Galuf's countrymen. They saw the flaws in our claimants from the outset.
The other two, though... They dismiss comrades willing to point out their shortcomings, and no good can come of it...
If he had his way, Papa would keep dueling until the day he dies.
Even now, I know of only three people who didn't need to be carried away after their bouts: Zoraal Ja, your lance-wielding friend Estinien, and yourself.
You really do live up to your fearsome reputation!
I'm curious, though. Did Papa want anything else of you?
Well, if that's all it was...
I still haven't had one bite of Namikka's food thanks to Papa's nonsense, so I'm going back to finish my plate before I head out.
I've otherwise asked everyone to meet at the For'ard Cabins. Come and join us after you've had a moment to recover, eh?
Dammit, Papa...
Sorry to keep everyone waiting.
Is that it? You're all set to go?
I left Eorzea prepared to travel in search of work, so I had few belongings to begin with. Bidding farewell to my fellow artisans took rather a lot of time, however.
Again, I appreciate you making this commitment, Fonjeantaine.
Shall we depart for Earthenshire, then?
A word before you go.
Wuk Evu, what are you doing here?
Ahhh! I spend my days correcting manners, and here I am perpetrating the grave offense of delaying the Third Promise's departure!
Please, take up your axe and rend my flesh unto taco meat!
Must your demands be so gruesome!? Besides, I told you that kind of thing doesn't bother me!
All right, then. I won't let it bother me either.
What was that all about...?
I'd come to the city to purchase supplies when I spotted your entourage getting ready to leave. You seek the city of gold, if I'm not mistaken?
That's right─it's the final step of the rite of succession. If you know anything about the subject, I'd love to hear it.
Then allow me to be of service. As you know, legends of the golden city have been passed down in Tural for a thousand years.
Yet when it comes to describing the place itself, the stories do not always agree. Some portray it as one might expect: a glittering metropolis of golden towers. Others suggest it is more unassuming and owes the name to a fabulous treasure hidden at its heart.
Every telling, however, has a common thread: those who go in search of the golden city do not return.
The lesson to be learned from this, Third Promise, is that to seek the legend is to court death. I must implore you to proceed with the utmost care.
That is all I wished to say. I shall pray for your safe journey.
Thank you, Wuk Evu.
What are we to make of these cautionary tales? If every expedition has ended in tragedy, how then did the Dawnservant find the city and return without incident?
It seems the legend originated with the Yok Huy. Speaking with them remains our strongest lead, I feel.
A lead we shall follow in time. But first, let us see Fonjeantaine safely into the Moblins' care.
A lead we shall follow in time. But first, let us see Fonjeantaine safely into the Moblins' care.
Finding a willing artisan was even easier than expected.
Many indeed are eager to curry favor with the Resilient Son─especially if it means sharing the promise of new territories.
Those who prove useful will have all the land they desire.
Such generous words, yet the manner in which he speaks them...
If neither wealth nor territory are of value, wherefore does he seek to bring the world to heel...?
Step aside.
Remind me... There was no rule against poaching craftsmen from other claimants, was there?
Do not be foolish, Bakool Ja Ja!
Hah! Foolish would be carrying on with these dull feats when all I need to win are the keystones!
And besides... It's long past time I humbled this arrogant one-head.
The Dawnservant may have sired you against all odds, but there is nothing blessed about your birth!
Only a two-head is fit to rule. Only we are worthy!
Draw your weapon! Face me in battle and learn your place!
A moment, First Promise.
Leave him alive, if you would. I foresee a use for this...nuisance.
Too scared to make the first move?
Then allow me!
But he... He's just a runt...
My thanks for your restraint.
I can kill him whenever I please.
Your part in this is far from over.
We're back, and we've brought with us a willing potsworn. This is Fonjeantaine, a talented goldsmith who once worked at Eshtaime's Aesthetics in Ul'dah.
Wonderful! Impressive! You are first to return, Third Promise!
And with an artisan from across the salt, no less! We welcome you and your unique skills to Earthenshire. Helphand will show you to the Workpot.
This is it, then. I look forward to hearing you proclaimed Dawnservant!
Thank you, Fonjeantaine. I'll be sure not to disappoint you.
You have reachmet the requirements of the Feat of Pots. Rediroq presents your keystone with joysmiles and wellwishing!
That makes three...
Pfff... Pfffkohhh... More potsworn candidates!? Come, come, tell Rediroq your tales!
Another feat accomplished, another keystone acquired.
Ohohoho, you are doing well. I expected nothing less of Zoraal Ja's esteemed siblings.
Your cleverness in particular is most admirable, Second Promise. We must have you apply that Sharlayan knowledge you so cherish, and arm Tural with weapons of magitek design.
...In your role as the new Dawnservant's chief advisor, of course.
The tools of war hold no interest for me. I wish only to improve our nation through practical innovations.
Foreign powers will think twice about testing our strength once Tuliyollal is known for its advanced technology.
Just as the Garlean Empire was deterred from invading Sharlayan.
That may well be true... But how long will it take Tuliyollal to progress to this advanced state? How many years?
With a collective commitment to education and hard work, it should not take so very─
Your way is too slow.
Easier to expand our territory...and swallow Sharlayan whole.
Conquer other nations through force of arms, and you're looking at a future of uprisings and bloodshed. Yours wouldn't be the first failed empire.
Then we keep fighting, until the mounting costs convince them to lay down their weapons. Until all have grown tired of loss.
How would such an outcome bring anyone joy!? What you propose is a mockery of peace!
Pfff... Pfffkohhh... Rediroq is reminded of days long ago.
In the time before Tuliyollal, there were no potpacts for the potsworn. It was normal to grabsnatch artisans, and force them to work for Mobbies.
Until the day Gulool Ja Ja arrived. The families of the grabsnatched pleaded with him, and so he came to Earthenshire.
Mobbies are not a warmake people. We feared death had come for us, but Gulool Ja Ja just wanted to talk!
