What took ye so bloody long, Edda? If me purse was too light, ye might've considered usin' some of yer own bleedin' coin to get us what we need!
Ye've only ever been as useful as the contents o' yer pockets─the gods know ye can barely 'eal a scratch!
We took up the 'venturin' life to take on the big jobs an' claim the big rewards. How're we meant to do that if ye can't even get our supplies in order?
Hm? It's 'er'im─the one Baderon was talkin' to!
Well, we'll see who gets the glory! This job should've been ours in the first place!
