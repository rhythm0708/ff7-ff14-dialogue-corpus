What you after? Fish? Crab? Think I've got an eel in a barrel somewhere, if you've a taste for 'em...
Ooh, I do love a bit of thyme. Chuck some in the pan, and it's like a bloody festival of flavor.
...Now what is it I can do for you? Can't say as there's been any major upsets to report these past few weeks.
Alphinaud, eh? Aye, I know the one. Our young champion of the downtrodden.
Eulmore's richer than all of Norvrandt put together, but it's a different story for them as live outside the city. Most spend every wakin' moment just tryin' to stay alive─which makes your friend's dedication to helpin' others stand out all the more.
Aye, I can hazard a guess as to where he is now, get a message to him. But you'll need somewhere quiet to meet, away from pryin' eyes...
Make for Stilltide─that's the fishin' village just up the path there. You're lookin' for a run-down excuse for a tavern the locals call the Leaky Keel. Wait there, and I'll see that Alphinaud joins you.
