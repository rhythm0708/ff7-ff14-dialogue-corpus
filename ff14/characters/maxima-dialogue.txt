But, Ambassador...
Disobey me, Pilus, and you disobey the Emperor. Make preparations to withdrawâ”€now.
...As you command.
My lord! You must fall back!
You ask me to run!?
Bah... Against such a foe, I would be more hindrance than help. The field is yours!
Spare my pride, would you? I know this foe is beyond me. The field is yours!
We will withdraw...but not without our countrymen. I want every soul accounted for. Every soul!
My lord!
