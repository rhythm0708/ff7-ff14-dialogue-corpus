You'd best keep your distance, if you know what's good for you. Say your piece and move on.
Looking for folks down on their luck? Congratulations, you've found one. As you can see, my leg ain't what it used to be. Some days I can hardly walk for the pain.
Mornings are the worst, especially after cold nights. Hard labor's right out─too much pain and trouble for others.
There's a tea what helps with it, though...I'd need to grind a chapuli horn and a hornbill talon for the blend...
Eh? You'll go and get some for me, just like that? You needn't trouble yourself so...
You've been gone a while. What brings you back to Ala Gannha?
Oh, I never meant to... I mean, in times like these, you never think people will actually...
This country's hard on people, but it's not just that. The imperials, they...they've made it known I'm not to be helped. A dead man's good for one lesson, you know, whereas a live one...
You're with the Resistance, right? I suppose there's no reason not to tell you then.
My father, gods rest his soul, was deathly sick at the time, and so I'd gone out into the forest, spear in hand, to gather herbs. And then I had the good fortune to run into an imperial patrol.
My weapon marked me as a rebel, or so they said. Not that it'd've made a difference if I'd fought back. I knew what the lot of them were about the moment that centurion laid eyes on me...
Didn't matter in the end, of course. Some people just like to hurt others. And by the time I limped back to the hut, it was too late for my father.
Too late for me too, aye, and many others I imagine. Help them too if you like─they'll be grateful and say thank you. But beyond that, I wouldn't hope for much.
