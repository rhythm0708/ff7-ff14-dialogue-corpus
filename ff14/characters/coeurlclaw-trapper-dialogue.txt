Gridanian bastards! How dare you attack our people!
...I told you, I do not need or want your assistance. Quite why you have deluded yourselves into thinking─
You're the one who's deluded! Thinking you could deceive us, when even a blind man could see that you cover your mouth every time you tell a lie.
...
Observe with intent, overlooking not the smallest detail. Discern your subject's unique characteristics, and recognize patterns in their behavior.
I learned these things from Luciane...and from you.
And I'll be damned if I'm going to watch you get yourself killed! There's still so much I don't know about Gridania and Wildwood archery, so much that I...that I need you to teach me!
...Hmph. I suppose fixing your form is the least I can do.
Why, you─
Pawah's gang is already on the move. We have but one chance to catch them.
Poachers throughout the Twelveswood use bone whistles like this one to communicate. With it, I believe we can lure Pawah out of hiding─assuming she has not moved on.
So that's why you came to Takers' Rot...for this gang's whistle.
Forename─if you are determined to help me, I have a task for you.
Pawah was last seen near Issom-Har. To the east of the camp, through a hollow tree trunk, is a clearing where two streams meet, and efts are wont to congregate. We will lay our trap there, and you will be the bait.
Do not fear, Forename. I swear on my honor as a Gridanian archer that no harm will come to you.
Bollocks. I knew I should've trusted me gut.
...Some blokes just can't take a hint.
I do hope you will forgive my forwardness, madam.
No, no, sir...'tis most flatterin'.
Wouldn't ye agree, sisters!? Why don't we show our gallant Wildwood admirer an' his mates just how much we appreciate their attentions!?
I hope ye like it rough, darlin'!
Leih, Forename─deal with the others. Pawah and I have unfinished business.
Heh, as you will!
