Ah, Captain Surname! Yours is a most welcome presence here at Camp Bluefog!
Logistically speaking, we are ready to march on Castrum Meridianum at a moment's notice. Alas, while our troops are here in body, their minds are anywhere but.
The garrison's mood is dark, so daunting is the prospect of joining what may prove to be the bloodiest battle in history. But with a hero such as you walking among them, we may yet rekindle the dwindling embers within their souls.
Captain Surname. I mentioned that I was hoping you might raise the flagging spirits of the men and women of our garrison.
Worry not, it is no unnecessarily laborious task that we ask of you. The mere presence of a hero such as you walking in their midst would no doubt serve to restore in them a measure of morale.
And so I ask of you this: make your way to the Ceruleum Processing Plant, and report to General Raubahn once you have arrived. And godsspeed, Captain Surnameâ”€our troops are counting on you.
Well, if it isn't the hero who brought down the praefectus! It's good to have you with us, friend.
As you can see, the mood about the camp here is grim at best. I was hoping that your presence alone might serve to raise spirits some.
Unfortunately, it would seem that many are too preoccupied wallowing in fear and self-pity that they have yet to even notice you have arrived.
Might I ask you to make the rounds and share a few words of encouragement to those men and women whose spirit falters? I had a mind to do it myself, but I am quite certain it would carry more weight coming from you.
Once you have seen to the others, go and do the same for Edelstein. No matter what he may claim, the lieutenant would also be better for a bit of rousing. Trust me, I know.
