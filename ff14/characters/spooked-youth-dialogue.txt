L-Leave me be, please! I swear to you, my flesh tastes absolutely terrible!
...Oh, gods, what are you doing, scaring me like that? If we're not quiet, those beasts'll find us!
The square, you say?
But that's where the satrap was killed─with my very eyes I saw him crushed in that creature's maw! So many lives lost...such terrible carnage...
And you say there is someone else who would lead Radz-at-Han in his stead!? Whoever they are, if they say anything to sully the memory of our beloved satrap, I'll make them regret it!
Welcome back, Forename. Alphinaud told me everything.
I was pleased to hear that Vrtra has chosen to reveal himself at last. The people of Radz-at-Han need a strong and wise satrap more than ever.
Finished rounding up the stragglers? The proclamation will begin shortly─let's wait here, lest we miss something important.
People are slowly making their way here, but many are still gripped by fear and doubt. Hopefully Vrtra's message of hope will resonate strongly enough with the ones willing to listen, and spread to every corner of Thavnair...
It would seem the people still have lingering doubts...and I cannot blame them.
Yet we know what strength is afforded us with one of the first brood on our side. I have faith the citizenry will come to understand and accept him in time.
I hear you were able to bring the situation at Palaka's Stand under control. Every life lost is a tragedy, but you should take pride in doing what you could.
When I assumed command during the earlier panic, I did so instinctively and out of necessity. 'Twas not my place to give orders, but I am glad the people heeded them.
But now they have need of a true leader─a magnanimous and just satrap who can guide them every step of the way. Fortunately, they are blessed with one such soul. If anyone can protect and guide them through this calamity, it is he.
Wyrm and man, working towards a common goal...
