...Aye, I served at the pleasure of King Theodoric, and lived to tell the tale. One of the palace guards, I was.
Truth be told, it was a dark chapter in my life, and one I'd sooner forget. Hardly a night went by when we didn't hear bloodcurdling screams echoing from the inner chambers─which, of course, we were under orders to ignore.
So we'd stand still as statues, trying not to imagine what horrors were unfolding within...<sigh> If you're hells-bent on finding out what happened in the palace, head down the street here and ask old Ernold─he was the king's head scribe.
