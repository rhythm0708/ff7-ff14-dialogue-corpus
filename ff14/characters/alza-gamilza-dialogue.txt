The Isles of Umbra? What interest have you in that godsforsaken place? Ever since we were forced to abandon Pharos Sirius, the isles have become naught more than a graveyard for ships unable to navigate the shores─and a purgatory for the souls dragged down to the depths with 'em.
R-R-Really!? Infested with the undead, you say. That...that is a very, very interesting development. Excuse me for a moment while I gather my thoughts.
W-W-Worry not, my friend! I've given your findings some thought, and I've concluded that this talk of spirits is naught more than local folklore. As for why all travel to the Isles of Umbra is restricted, well...mayhap it's considered too dangerous, owing to the abandonment of Pharos Sirius?
Yes, well, anyway─while you were questioning those Yellowjackets, I paid a visit to the local pub, since even an esteemed scholar like myself enjoys dulling her wits on occasion.
It was there that I heard tell of a man named Skyfryn, who was recently detained after returning from─wait for it─the Isles of Umbra!
This is the first I've heard of someone actually traveling to and from there, so I'm curious as to how he obtained permission. Mind having a chat with him in my stead? He was arrested, after all, so I'm somewhat reticent to approach him myself...
