Tesleen!
Have you seen Halric!? I swear, I only took my eyes off him for a moment...
Forename, Alisaie─we have to go look for Halric!
I don't know what's gotten into him, but if he's wandering out there alone...
We'll assign search areas and split up. Any idea where he might be headed?
No, he's never done anything like this before. But it can't be a coincidence that the other patients are suddenly so agitated. They can sense something...
In any case, let's keep the search close to the Inn. Halric isn't very sure on his feet, so he won't have gone far. I'll search the east side!
Please, Halric... Please be all right...!
I'll cover the north and west, then. You take everything from here to the south!
I'll cover the north and west, then. You take everything from here to the south!

Any sign of him!?
No luck, then. But he surely can't have gone far.
We should keep looking. The sin eaters are out in force, and if we don't find him soon, you can be sure they will.
Did you see the size of that thing? It must be one of the nasty ones.
Wherever it's going, it can only mean trouble. After it!
There it is!
Is that─ Oh...oh no!
Halric!
We have to run!
Tesleen, no!
We all deserve happiness...wherever we can find it...
The time left to you...is precious... No one should die...in pain...
Mother...Mother, I...
Oh no, no... No, no, no, no, no!
Forgive me...Alisaie...
I...
I'm sorry, Forename. I tried to tell the carers what happened, but...
...I can't be the shoulder they lean on. Not like this.
