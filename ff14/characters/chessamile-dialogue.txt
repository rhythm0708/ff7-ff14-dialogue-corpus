Yes, sweetie? Is there something you need? ...Oh, one of the guard come for your dram, are you?
Here you go. A dose of this will keep you firmly in the waking world while your enemies are off in dreamland.
Now, if this is your first time, I should warn you: it's bitter as sin. Prince's kiss, they call it, but if you ask me, it should be crone's kiss! Hee hee!
Jests aside, the stuff really is foul. Most people gag like there's no tomorrow─but if you don't drain every last drop, you're liable to end up taking a trip to dreamland yourself. So I must ask you to drink it here and now, while I watch. Come on! Give the old crone a kiss, hee hee!
Well done, sweetie! I'm proud of you! Why, if I didn't know any better, I'd even say you enjoyed it! And now you needn't fear falling asleep on the battlefield. Just have care you don't lose any limbs out there, all right? They don't tend to grow back.
Yes? What do you require of me?
An amaro to take you to the Imperative, eh?
As much as I would like to oblige, all our mounts are reserved for the coming operation. I fear you will have to go by foot.
Hmmm, but wait. There might be another way, assuming you are willing to lend a hand.
I was about to deliver an amaro to Radisca's Round, one of the locations whence the beasts will fly for the operation.
The tower lies along the route to the Imperative. If near enough is good enough for you, you may make the delivery in my stead.
Very good. I shall ready the amaro for departure at once.
Radisca's Round is to the north and west. You can take the road or you can fly─it is up to you.
Upon arriving, make yourself known to the sentry, and she will give you further instructions.
If you should become separated from the amaro, worry not─the beasts are trained to return to the rookery. That is all. Go well.
