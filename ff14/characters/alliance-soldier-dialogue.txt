Is that the Azure Dragoon?
What took you so long?
I-Incredible...
The Amalj'aa are in trouble.Let's split up.
Estinien! Leave these foes to us!
One could not ask for more dependable allies!
Let us follow Tiamat and Ser Estinien's lead!
Very well. I shall fly to their aid.
Such strength...
Hyah!
Here I come!
Have at you!
Fall, damn you!
Lord Aymeric! And Lucia!
The armies of the Alliance have entered the fray.
We shall see the wounded to safety.You are needed elsewhere!
That should give us a moment's rest.
Help is on the way. Please, hold on a little longer...
Fall back!
Oh no you don't.
Together, we will force the enemy back!
It seems Estinien is good for something after all.
As you should well know!Or have you been ignoring my tales of his exploits?
My poor child...I shall free thee from thy pain.
My children...
The time has come...
So be it.
May you finally be at peace.
