And so they came, at a friend's behest.
To Ishgard, shining city on the mount, overlooking the dominion of Coerthas...
A great and proud nation devoted to Halone, the Fury, ruled by Thordan VII, Archbishop of the Ishgardian Orthodox Church...
The last bastion of the Faith, her walls ever bristling with the sworn swords and spears of her four High Houses...
A land that after a thousand years of war had forgotten what it was to be at peace.
Through gates long closed the Warrior of Light and her companions passed, entering at last a city whose history was written in blood.
In the midst of the Dragonsong War they cameâ€”three weary travelers whose arrival would set in motion great change...
Though none knew then how great...
Though none knew then how great...
