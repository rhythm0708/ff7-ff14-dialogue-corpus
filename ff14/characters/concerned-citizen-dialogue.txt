And you wouldn't be mistaken.
But it's been five years since the Calamity! Why are they only coming here now?
It's simple, really─while a number of hamlets survived the immediate aftermath of the Calamity, many were no longer able to support their communities.
The residents found their lands had either been rendered barren, or cut off from trade routes─and problems like those aren't easily solved. Though they tried to make the best of it, it was only a matter of time before they were forced to abandon their homes and seek a new life in the city.
I see...
But the Calamity affected the whole realm, didn't it? Is the same thing happening in the other cities?
If the talk is true, yes.
Though perhaps our situation is more pronounced. Ul'dah has a reputation for being prosperous, so it's natural that the refugees would try their luck here first.
My heart goes out to them, it truly does...but I would be lying if I said that I wasn't apprehensive. I hope their presence doesn't foment lawlessness in the city.
Well, if things do take a turn for the worse, we always have the Immortal Flames. I daresay the Brass Blades would welcome their help.
The heroes who fought the Garlean Empire, patrolling the streets for riffraff?
It may well come to that.
Impoverished and desperate as they are, you may be sure that some of the refugees will turn to crime.
You know what this place is like. If you've no coin, you've no hope.
<sigh> What will become of our city?
Not all refugees are bad, mind you. Some are able to find employment and lead honest lives.
