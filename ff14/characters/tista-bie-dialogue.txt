Welcome to the Beehive, my little drone. Seeking the sting of excitement to liven up your day?
...Hm hm, I can tell at a glance when folk are new to our happy colony. It's the nervous fluttering, you see─always gives them away.
Why don't we play some cards to set you at your ease, eh? A quick game of “High or Low”─it's simply a matter of guessing who has the bigger hand.
If you win, I'll grant you a single favor...within reason, of course. Interested?
Ready for a game of “High or Low”, then?
Good for you! No time like the present, I say!
Oh? Well, you know where to find me if you want to play a hand or two.

Three cards for you, three cards for me. You flip one of yours over, and I flip two of mine.
Now, what's your call? Will your total be higher or lower than mine?
You're going with “high,” then? Right, let's see what we've got...
You're going with low,” then? Right, let's see what we've got...
My cards add up to ○○. And you have...
...a total of ○○.
Oho, it seems we came out equal. But as lovely a coincidence as that may be, we still need a clear winner...
That's what I like to hear. Let me shuffle the deck...
Had enough for now? Fine, fine─I'll be sitting right here should the mood strike you.
Aw... Sorry, honeybee, but this match goes to me.

Congratulations, your guess was right!
Hm... Usually I'd concede defeat at this point, but what do you say to a rematch? One more win, then we'll talk about that favor.
Another match of “High or Low”? Come now, little honeybee, we all need our diversions.
Good for you! No time like the present, I say!

Well, well, would you look at that. I think you've got a knack for this, newcomer.
Congratulations! Victory is yours...as is the prize I promised.
Come whisper in my ear, then, and don't be shy. Tell ol' Tista what she can do for you.
...That's all? How delightfully wholesome. But if knowledge is what you want, then that is what you shall have.
In my humble estimation, the most wondrous thing about this town is how safe we are from the sin eaters.
They say Lord Vauthry was born with the power to command them─which means no Eulmoran need ever raise a weapon in defense of the city.
...Was that the kind of thing you wished to know? If your itch still needs scratching, you might get a few words out of Atharn over there. There's naught that merry sot likes more than the sound of his own voice.
