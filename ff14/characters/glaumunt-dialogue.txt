Lookin' for Glaumunt, are you? Well, you've found him, whoever you are.
...Eh? You're lookin' to get inside Castrum Centri, and you need my help? Heh, somethin' tells me we're gonna get along just fine.
...So you have friends at Castrum Centri what want for rescue. That Slafborn knows me too well─aye, you can count on my help.
I've got a score to settle with the imperials, an' I never pass on an opportunity to get back at the whoresons. But enough about me, let's talk strategy.
Rescuin' folk from captivity's right delicate business. A single oversight─just one little blunder─an' it's all over. You can't leave any room for uncertainty.
For starters, you need to confirm beyond the shadow of a doubt that your friends're where you think they are. You don't want to risk your neck only to discover they've been moved elsewhere. But how can you find out, you ask? By followin' these instructions:
If you approach Centri from the east, you'll see a swampland to your left called the Tangle. Get in there, never mind all the morbols, an' navigate your way to the southwestern corner.
You'll come upon some drainage pipes comin' down from the stronghold. Don't ask me how I know, but one o' them leads back up to the command tower. If you listen closely, might be as you can eavesdrop on some o' the happenin's within.
Once we know for certain your friends're there, we'll move to the next stage o' the operation. Now, get goin', and godsspeed!
