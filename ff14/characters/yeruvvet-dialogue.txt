Young Matsya here has told me everything. I have not the words to express my gratitude for your aid.
When the heavens began to burn, we were afraid, but did our best to carry on as we always have done...
Until today, when those unholy beasts came pouring into our village, a flood of midnight and death...
There are no words to describe what followed. Men and women I have known since they were babes struck down by the creatures, only to rise again to join the murderous horde, in the guise of those same hideous fiends...
In the chaos, a handful of our villagers fled for their lives. I can only hope they have found their way to safety...
Matsya, do you perchance remember Qerasaf and Mehvan? The young couple who always bought your freshest catches...
How could I forget, Elder? When I first came to peddle my wares─desperate to eke out a living─they showed me such kindness...
Others shunned me as an outsider, as is their way. But Qerasaf and Mehvan bought my fish, and sung its praises. They turned my fortunes around!
Alas, I fear they are in terrible danger. I saw them running towards Agama Temple, one of those beasts in close pursuit.
They had their child─still but a tiny babe. To elude these fiends while caring for one so young is an impossible task, surely. I beg of you, go to their aid...
I...I want to help them. Yet I am but a fisherman─I cannot face beasts on my own. Will you come with me?
Oh, thank you! Agama Temple lies to the west of here. We must hurry!
The temple is just ahead...
It was built by those who worship Saint Agama, but has sadly fallen into disrepair in recent years.
If my friends made it this far, no doubt they are hiding somewhere amidst the ruins.
