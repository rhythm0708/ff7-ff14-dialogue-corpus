Sorry, I didn't mean to stare. My name is Lyse, and these are my friends, Forename and Alisaie.
We're looking for the overseer of Sui-no-Sato, Shiosai. That's you, isn't it?
...The Kojin of the Blue sent you hither, did they?
I am no overseer, nor ever would I claim to be one. I am high priest of Shisui of the Violet Tides. Shiosai.
So you are the man we're looking for! Great! We need your help. We're looking for this jewel called the Yasakani-noâ”€
Stop. I will hear no more.
We will suffer no outside troubles in our sanctuary. Especially those of would-be treasure hunters.
