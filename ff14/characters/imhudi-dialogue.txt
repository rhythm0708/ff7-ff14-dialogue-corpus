Ah, I've heard about you. The visitor from Eorzea. Is there anything you can tell us about the Telophoroi?
We know that they're the ones behind the tower, and that they've declared war on the whole world.
But why are they doing this? What is it that they want? This, we don't understand.
...What? They want to die...and take everyone with them!? What madness is this!?
Well, you can bet that we won't let those bastards have their way! We'll fight them with everything we have, like our Eorzean and Far Eastern brothers!
Grrr, those demented fools... If they want to go to hell, they can bloody well arrange their own passage, and leave the rest of us out of it!
