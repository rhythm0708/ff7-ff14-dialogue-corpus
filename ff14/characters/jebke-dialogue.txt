Oh, hello there! We weren't expecting visitors─not with use of the lift being restricted. How did you make it down here, anyway?
The mineshaft, you say? Well, you're a much hardier soul than I!
Under normal circumstances, I'd reward such tenacity with a guided tour of the fields, but I'm afraid the Forum has us filling order lists a malm long.
Massive-yet-detailed requests. Literal wagonloads of crop samples, and hardly any time to put them together.
When I first heard of this grand “reorganization,” I assumed we would be shuffling around old stock to make room for the new. Then came the orders for ridiculous quantities of seeds we've already thoroughly researched.
Passing strange, eh? I pressed for an explanation...and was met with vague assurances that all would be revealed in due course. Not the most satisfying answer...
