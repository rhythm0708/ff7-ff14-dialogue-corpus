I preach the teachings of Azeyma, the Warden. Hast thou come to partake of the honey of Her wisdom?
Azeyma is keeper of the sun and goddess of inquiry. All is laid bare beneath the light of Her divine countenance. Open thy heart to this light, needy child, and thou shalt want for naught till the end of days!
