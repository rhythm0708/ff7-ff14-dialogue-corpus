You cannot take this from me! Never will I surrender my devotion...my love!
And here I thought we'd moved past this.
'Tis the very depravity she showed at the Waking Sands.
Bear my pain unto my enemy's breast, Aglaea!
Not again... Never again will I yield to you!
My...lord... Gaius!!!
Release thy passions. For thine own sake.
May you be cleansed by the tide.
Follow the flow of aether. It will guide you!
The aether is too dense... I'm losing you!
The aether is too dense... I'm losing you!
Thou ever grantest me the strength to move forward...
She'll always be here for you.
She'll always be here for you.
The heraldry of House Fortemps...
