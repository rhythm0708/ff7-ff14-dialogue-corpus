We never gave up hope that Zekowa would find a way to get us out. He always was the best of the Daybreakers. Glad he was able to convince you to go along with his plan.
Unfortunately, our group is smaller now, and lacking in strength besides. Some outlaws might see us as an easy target.
Even so, if anyone should give the Dustwatch the slip, the Daybreakers'll be there!
We'll train night and day, so no one'll get the better of us ever again. Isn't that right?
Right! And you'll teach us how you draw your pistols so fast, won't you?
Well, we won't need to duel if all goes as it should.
But on the off chance it doesn't, we'd best make sure everyone can match or beat my speed.
We owe you a great debt, and one of these days, I'll be sure to repay it. On that you have my word.
Until we meet again.
If you'll excuse me, I shall find a quiet place to rest.
As I'll be here a while yet, though, do let me know if there is any way I can be of assistance.
Were you not planning to take the train home?
Oh, train service has been suspended. Didn't I tell you?
You mentioned no such thing.
Something about the tracks being damaged in the last quake. The tunnel was closed as well.
An earthquake? It must have happened when we were still down south.
There've been quite a few tremors of late, and a rather large one struck not long before you two arrived. I can only hope no one was hurt...
At any rate, if you want to know when service will resume, you could speak with the stationmaster yourself.
Let's do that. The station is just over there.
I'd like to believe the train will be up and running again soon...
