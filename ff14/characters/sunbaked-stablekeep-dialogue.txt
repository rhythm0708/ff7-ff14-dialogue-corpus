Well, what have we here?
Short on rroneek?
'Fraid so. If one'll suffice, I have a creature ready and waiting.
But if you need two, then you'll have to wait.
The rroneek have been actin' strangely of late─more easily spooked and otherwise disagreeable. Pickin' out the few fit for rentin's provin' bothersome work.
They're usually so docile, and the ones I saw earlier didn't appear to be unhealthy, either. But much has changed since last I was here...
Not the best start to our journey.
Still, the train station isn't far. Seeing as we aren't in a hurry, let's go on foot.
About that, sir. As well traveled as you look, it's not only the rroneek that've been givin' us trouble. Other wildlife have shown signs of aggression, too.
A merchant should be returnin' soon with one of our beasts. Stick around till they do, and I'll see you both on rroneek for a safer trip.
Your offer is most appreciated, but I don't think my friend here is particularly concerned about the wildlife.
As well you should. Glad to see at least one of you's got some sense.
...You're enjoying this, aren't you?
Hahaha! If this is your first time in Shaaloani, I can understand your enthusiasm. It'd be a shame not to ride one at least once while you're here.
A fair point. If we're to give you the “authentic Shaaloani experience,” I suppose it's worth the wait.
Even if you left now, waitin' for the rroneek'd be faster than walkin', and safer besides. You'll be back on the road before you know it, I promise.
And there we have it.
Right, change of plans. There's a small town nearby. We can pass the time there while waiting.
Take it you're headin' to Hhusatahwi, then. I'll have a man bring the rroneek over there.
Just mind yourself around the drunkards and troublemakers, eh?
Won't take long, rest assured. Keep an eye out for a man in Hhusatahwi with two rroneek.
Last time I was here, it was little more than a camp with a shop or three.
Well, well... It's become a proper town.
