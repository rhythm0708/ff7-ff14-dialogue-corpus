It is impossible to adequately discuss Eorzean cuisine without speaking of that land from which many of our modern-day staples hail: the far-western continent of Tural.
Ogre pumpkins, ruby tomatoes, even the ubiquitous popoto─these crops and more that regularly grace Eorzean dining tables trace their origins to the “New World,” as the place is known to most.
The tale of this culinary immigration begins in the year 1498 of the Sixth Astral Era, when a Lominsan sailor named Ketenramm successfully traversed the Indigo Deep to arrive at the theretofore unknown continent.
Ketenramm spent several moons exploring inland, in the course of which he encountered the denizens of the sprawling nation of Mamool Ja. He was even granted an audience with their supreme leader, whose confidence he won along with permission to roam freely.
Ketenramm would return to Tural several times, but during his first expedition he charted the land and gathered myriad root vegetables and seeds to bring back to Limsa Lominsa.
The most notable of these was the popoto, whose ease of cultivation and nutritional value saw it quickly spread to all corners of Eorzea.
Produce was far from the only bounty of Ketenramm's expeditions to Tural. Many tantalizing recipes such as the bean-filled burrito and gripping legends such as that of the golden city reached our shores by way of his ship.
To those outside of Ketenramm's circle, Tural largely remains shrouded in mystery, yet its influence on our cuisine cannot be overstated. Many scholars─myself included─would relish the chance to immerse themselves in the culinary culture of that faraway continent.

Scoured the library to your satisfaction, have you? Excellent.
While there are few books wholly dedicated to the subject of Tural, I daresay you've found tidbits of useful information scattered here and there.
But come, let's continue this outside. The mammets do not take kindly to chatter.
Now then, I'm quite keen to hear your honest impressions.
I couldn't help but notice that we read the very same book on cuisine. I was pleasantly surprised to find references to Tural within.
Among them, did anything in particular pique your interest?
Ah yes, the renowned Lominsan explorer who traversed the Indigo Deep and discovered the unknown west!
And his accomplishments didn't end there. He traveled Tural extensively, and even forged a friendship with the Dawnservant.
If we were able to meet Ketenramm, what things we could learn. Alas, all of this happened nigh four score years ago, and he may no longer be alive to tell his tales...
As have I. Despite having just enjoyed a hearty meal, I found myself craving popotoes.
As they keep well, they were a boon to sailors, and it was that same property that allowed them to survive the voyage to Eorzea.
The book also mentioned a method of preservation which sees popotoes repeatedly frozen and dried. The resultant product was apparently used in a stew by people in mountainous regions. I should like to sample that dish one day─that and all the unique cuisines of that vast continent.
Hah! I suspected any mention of the city of gold would catch your eye. 'Tis truly a mystery among mysteries.
Here is a city whose location is unknown, that no one has ever seen. And yet whispers of its existence continue to persist.
Countless souls have set off in search of it, never to return. I can imagine it being a suitable challenge for the ritual of succession.
But moving on, did you perchance learn aught about the fauna of Tural? Given your adventuring background, I expect the topic would interest you.
Ah yes, the alpaca. In addition to serving as beasts of burden, they provide clothing for people by way of their lush fleece.
They are especially prized by mountain tribes, who hold certain rare specimens sacred.
Ah, yes. The great horned beasts kept by the Mamool Ja, who unleash them on fortified positions to devastating effect.
That reminds me. I recall hearing that a few specimens were brought to Vylbrand not long ago. Perhaps it's possible to see them on the island.
Now why do I get the impression you're imagining pitting your skills against the fell beast?
Unfortunately, I found scant details on your would-be prey. One source simply described it as an “enormous, winged creature with scales hard as steel that rules the skies.” I should like to see it with my own eyes—presuming it even exists.
I thought I heard familiar voices.
Fancy running into the two of you here.
Well, well. Have some research of your own, do you?
Aye, we hope to arm ourselves with knowledge that may benefit the Garlean people.
Having forged a new trade agreement with Radz-at-Han, they will next look to foster relations with other nations. This includes former imperial provinces.
In view of this, we hope to find hints in history on how neighbors of differing races and ideologies might engage with one another.
And what of the two of you? What endeavor brings you here this day?
A nation composed of the disparate peoples of Tural...
I daresay this is precisely the kind of example we seek. We'd do well to read up on Tuliyollal ourselves.
The contest─is Forename the only one allowed to help Wuk Lamat?
There was no mention of such restrictions, as I recall. On the contrary, Wuk Lamat gave us the impression that she could have several champions.
I think I know how to make the most of our respite. Follow me, Alphinaud! We have planning to do!
A-Alisaie! Wait!
<sigh> 'Twould seem our plans have changed. If you'll excuse me...
They never could rest on their laurels...
Come, let us return to the annex.
Oh, it's just... Despite all that we've learned, I can't help but feel we've yet to hear the whole story...
What about you, my friend? Are you inclined to accept or refuse Wuk Lamat's request?
Hah, I thought you might say that.
With an intrepid attitude such as yours, I believe all shall be well.
Be it the contest or something else, there will be many trials for you to overcome at your destination.
But in the course of seeing new lands and meeting new people, you'll surely find a way forward. That's what adventurers do, is it not?
I don't blame you. No matter the assurances, it's no simple thing to wade into the midst of a political struggle, and in a foreign land at that.
How about this, then. Instead of deciding here, go there first and then decide.
In the course of seeing new lands and meeting new people, you'll surely find a way forward.
That's what adventurers do, is it not?
If only others had the same good sense.
If the prospect troubles you so, why not consider what you stand to gain instead? That is, an exciting journey to a faraway continent.
In the course of seeing new lands and meeting new people, you might find yourself moved to help Wuk Lamat after all. And if not, well...you quietly take your leave.
A brazen plan, perhaps, but one that befits a veteran adventurer, you must agree!
Such a journey would be the envy of many a scholar. Distant as it is, Tural remains largely unknown to us, with only meager records to be found in Noumenon.
The experiences to be had─all the things you might hear, feel, and think... It's enough to stir me to the core.
Life is a series of journeys, my friend, and there's no telling what awaits us on the long road.
But what's important is to be true to yourself as you walk it.
Only then can we hope to be content when we arrive at the end of one─and step forward into another.
Ah, but there's an idea!
I have a matter to attend to at the Agora. Please go on inside─I will join you shortly.
Welcome back, Forename. If you're looking for Wuk Lamat, she is currently with the others in her chambers.
If you like, I can go and fetch them for you?
Understood! Please wait in the main hall.
Please go ahead to the main hall. It won't be long.
You have the look of someone who's made up their mind. Go on then, let's hear it.
Then you need me as much as I need you. Together, we'll blaze new trails in Tural!
Excellent! You'll be compensated for your troubles, of course, but I daresay your time in Tural will be its own reward!
You're not planning to leave without us, are you?
Alphinaud! Alisaie! What are you two doing here?
We happened to cross paths at Noumenon earlier, you see, and I told them about Wuk Lamat.
And when we fortuitously met again at the Agora just now, they expressed an interest in meeting our visitor.
Ah, you must be the twins who were sneaking after Erenville as toads!
A hundred things about us you could have told her, and you chose that!?
First impressions last.
'Tis an honor and a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Your Highness. Alphinaud Leveilleur, at your service, and this is my sister, Alisaie.
Oh, no, let's not do that. I really can't stand titles.
So. You want to participate in the contest too, is that right?
Indeed we do.
We've been assisting with the rebuilding effort in Garlemald. Yet while progress is being made, the question remains of how the nation might reconcile with its neighbors.
We believe there is much we might learn from Tuliyollal, a nation founded on unity. And in return for this honor, we would spare no effort in supporting your claim.
The more the merrier, I say. And I'd be keen to learn about Eorzea and Garlemald from you as well.
Having recruited so many committed and capable allies, I presume you have no need for my continued assistance.
Nonsense! Like I told you before, you're indispensable.
They're strong, aye, but strangers to our land. They need someone to guide them─to point out the dangers and spare them grisly deaths.
I can't think of anyone better suited to that task than you. What's more, despite your assertions, I know you haven't given up on the city of gold.
As I recall, Krile, you were the first to state your desire to visit Tural.
Perhaps I was...
Still, I can't help but worry about being away just when our order is beginning to find its feet again.
You have nothing to worry about.
I haven't forgotten how you held the fort while I set off to explore Alzadaal's Legacy; it's only fair that I return the favor. Pray leave the Students to Ojika and me.
But Raha...
You want to retrace your grandfather's steps, don't you? This is a rare opportunity, and I insist that you seize it!
Thank you, Raha. Thank you.
Well, looks like it's settled! I'm counting on you all to help me win the throne!
I suppose now is a good time to show you what I spent a small fortune on at the Agora.
There!
This, my friends, is the latest map of the world, created to celebrate our friendship with the Loporrits. Cast your eyes west of Sharlayan, for there it lies...
The site of your next great adventure─Tural!
Lest you wonder about your passage to Tural, Erenville will arrange a ship through his guild. You need only worry about your own preparations.
Speaking of which, please take this with you─a rugged and ready knapsack! May it serve you well on your coming adventures!
Now, I'm not sure when departure will be, but rest assured I'll let you know when I hear something. Till then, please take your ease!

When does the next ship set sail?
