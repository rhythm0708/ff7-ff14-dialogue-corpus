Herbs, is it? Six sprigs of whatever's on hand? 'Fraid I can't spare that much. You'll take two, and be glad of it.
The remainder you'll have to gather yourself. Shouldn't be too much of a bother, thoughâ”€you'd be surprised what you can find growing underfoot, even in the Reach.
Ah, there you are. Got those herbs I asked for?
Thanks, that'll do nicely. And, uh...sorry to impose upon you, miss. Thought you were another new recruit. Didn't realize until after that you were, uh...
But to answer the question that's probably on your mind, yes. It's always like this. Never enough food or supplies to go around.
All the more reason to be grateful when our countrymen can spare some for the cause. Though that comes at a cost, too. Too many villages, too many children more deserving than us...
But a man can't fight on an empty stomach, can he? So we partake, as we must. And we never lose sight of the dream.
