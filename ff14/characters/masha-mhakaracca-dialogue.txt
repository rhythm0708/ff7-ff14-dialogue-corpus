It'll be eggcellent!
This crowd's got even my knees shakin'... I can't imagine what Peatie must be feelin'.
Grrr...
My thanks, Forename. It seems word has spread even further than I had hoped.
And while this is cause for celebration, Peatie appears to be intimidated by their expectant gazes.
Grrr...
'Course, you could just hop up on her head and she'd calm down just like that. But we can't lean on you forever.
Why don't you rally her spirits with some encouragin' words, Forename? Seems she's warmed to you, and I reckon she'd appreciate whatever you have to say.
She can dazzle them, she just needs to believe...
Grrr...
Grrr...
Truth be told, this is her first time performin' alone in front of so many people. I can see why her legs won't listen to her heart.
Grrr!
That did the trick! You've really got a talent for liftin' the spirits of the downtrodden, Forename!
We are in your debt, truly!
It's almost time. Lady Aliapoh should have arrived by nowâ”€Forename, pray join the bystanders and give Peatie your heartiest cheer!
The show shall start anon. Go on, join the crowd and lend your voice to the cheers!
Your words were like a drop of water on a hot day. I reckon Peatie might even like you more than me!
Grrr!
Grrr!
Ulala! Look at me!
And now for the final act! Bedecked in blooming flowers, this goobbue princess has prepared something unforgettable for all the little ladies out there!
This is just how I envisioned it in my dream!
And to think I ever believed goobbues were naught but wild beasts! Oh, I simply adore her!
