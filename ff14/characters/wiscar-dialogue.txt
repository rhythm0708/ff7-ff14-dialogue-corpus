...And where were you these past twenty years!? Where were you when we were being ground under the Black Wolf's boot!? On the other side of his bastard wall, living the high life, I'll wager!
That's not fair!
Ho, and who's this, another one of your freedom-loving friends, deigning to help us poor unfortunate souls?
Trying to whip us into a frenzy so we'll go and storm a castrum with our pickaxes and shovels!? Leave, all of you, before you bring a cohort down on us all!
And youâ”€don't you dare speak like you're one of us. You can't even begin to understand what we've been through. You weren't here, Lyse! You weren't here!
This is my home, and I love it with all my heart. And if you truly have any love for it too, you'll keep us out of your doomed rebellion.
...He has a point. No matter what I say or do, it doesn't change the fact I left them behind.
But this isn't about me, or anyone else. It's about Ala Mhigo. Let's go and find Meffrid.
Looks like the elder wasn't the only one unwilling to hear us out. Can't blame them, given what happened at the Wall.
I thought I might be able to appeal to them as a fellow...I don't know. But, if anything, it just made them angrier. I haven't lived through it like they have.
I can't claim to know the struggle like they do either, Lyse. I ran too, aye, but if I hadn't, I'd've never met Forename or the rest of you, and we might not be here today, in a position to make a difference.
So I don't regret my choices, nor will I apologize for them. There's more than one way to fight.
