Aye, I'm Sevrin. You the old man's errand boy, now?
Tell my dear old captain not to wet his britches. I'll be along.
Oh, and just so we're clearâ”€I don't care for landlubbers. Go find the chocobo you rode in on, and ride on out.
You continue to impress, lass. All but Sevrin are accounted for.
It's no fault of yours he squirmed out. I've let that worm wriggle through my fingers more times than I can count.
But rest assured, the next time I see him, I'll put him squarely in the dirt, where all such worms belong.
Pains me to say, but all the gil in the world can't buy loyalty. There are some, like you, who can be trusted. But then there are others...
Until now, I've had no choice but to rely on that charlatan Sevrin, even though I am full aware he's been doin' shady deals behind my back. More than once I've heard tell of improper tradin' with goblins.
I wouldn't be the least surprised if that were happenin' right now. Not a bell ago, a sack of oranges vanished, as did Sevrin. I want you to find and confront the bastard for me, Surname. I'm sure there's wrongdoin' afoot, so be sure to doubt anythin' that comes out of his mouth.
What's this now? Staelwyrn sent you for the oranges? Huh... So the old bugger had known all this time... Argh, what does it matter anyway?
Listen, you're one o' those goody-goody adventurer types, right? Go rescue me mates from those double-dealin' goblins! They're just over yonder by the bonfire.
I owe you one. Would've gotten away meself if not fer Sevrin shovin' me aside.
Sevrin sent you? Hah! The way he flew out of here, I was sure he'd sold us down the river!
If you hadn't come, my dodo would've been cooked! Mmm...cooked dodo.
You saved me mates, and for that, I owe you.
S'pose I should be ashamed I couldn't clean up my own mess...
...But a pirate knows no shame! I've no qualms about goin' back on my word! I'm only givin' you this sack 'cause I like the cut of your jib. Take it to Ossine, an' send him my regards.
