Esteemed for their excellence in the study of electrope, the Milalla were favored by the rulers of many a nation.
Some among them have attempted to invoke the power of their ancient relic to return to their homeland, but their efforts were to no avail. Never again has the golden path opened that allowed their ancestors to flee to safety.
Eventually, the relic came to be forgotten, and some now question whether it ever actually existed.
Quite a mystical atmosphere here. Is this what the Milalla homeland was like?
