Wuk Lamat!
Where are you? Wuk Lamat!
By the gods... It's...Namikka...
Begging your pardon, but I'm looking for a child─a small Xbr'aal girl. Have you seen her by any chance?
You─you are Namikka, aren't you?
It's me, Wuk Lamat. Don't you recognize me?
Oh, what am I to do? The child and I, we aren't related by blood, but she's as dear to me as my own...
It's all right. You've found her. I'm here.
You...could it be?
Yes, Namikka. You know these eyes, this voice. It's me, Wuk Lamat.
It is you! How silly of me. But if you're here, then that means...
No, no. I'm still alive.
Good, good... Thank the gods for that...
But what power has brought us together again? This isn't a dream, is it?
It's not a dream.
Or rather, it is a dream come true. I so wanted to hear your voice one more time.
Just look at you. My Wuk Lamat. Stronger and more assured than I've ever seen.
Such hazards you must have braved and hardships endured to come so far...
It was tough, but I made it thanks to my friends.
And to you, Namikka.
I'm the person I am now because you always believed in me. Because you loved me as if I were your own daughter.
Thank you, thank you. You're everything I could've asked for─the best mother!
Ahhh... I'm so glad...
Looking back, I've had a blessed life. And it was because I was a part of yours.
When I lost my child to illness, I thought I'd never know happiness again. But it rekindled in my breast the instant you smiled your little smile at me. You became my purpose. My joy.
You were mine too.
To have this chance to speak with you again and leave nothing unsaid... I know not how or why, but I am grateful. So grateful.
Where you must go, I cannot follow, but know that I'll always be with you. Take care of yourself. Promise me.
I will, Mama. I will.
And one day...we'll meet again!
I understand why Sphene cannot bear to let them go.
But as painful as it is to part...
We're meant to live and die. To let go and let others carry on in our stead. We can't cling to everything forever.
Come, let's keep moving!
Namikka looked truly happy...
The show was breathtaking, was it not?
I've made a wonderful memory. Thank you.
...
Just to make sure, Cahciua─you're not going to disappear when we shut this terminal down, right?
Not just yet. It's the Aero Terminal in the northwestern zone that holds my memories.
...
You already know how to operate the terminal. It's the same process as the fountain's control.
I leave it for you to decide when to shut it down. Doing so will cause the Endless here to fade away, together with this beautiful scenery.
If you still wish to speak with people or see the sights, you'll want to do that first.
Sleep tight, everyone...
This is Living Memory's true appearance...
I had braced myself for it, but to actually erase the Endless is...hard.
Thank you.
...
This hurts. I'd be lying if I said otherwise.
But the only way now is forward...
I chose this path. I won't halt my steps.
Don't torment yourselves so. I asked this of you, so the burden lies with me.
And remember, we Endless are but facsimiles crafted from memories. You needn't feel guilt for erasing us.
Be that as it may, it's so hard to say good-bye...
It is. Nonetheless, it's our duty as the living to know and remember them.
So let's pull ourselves together and keep at it. Keep seeking them out.
I'd appreciate that. Come, let's head to the next zone.
Yesterland, it's called, and another zip line at the Gate of Remembrance will take you there.
Ah, but I ought to mention...
While shutting down a terminal should erase the Endless bound to it, those with strong, unresolved feelings may linger for a time.
If you encounter such individuals, perhaps you could lend them an ear. For their hopes are proof that they once lived.
...Worry not, Forename. I don't intend to halt my steps either.
That lively place yonder appears to be Yesterland. I wonder what manner of folk we will find there.
Yesterland has an altogether different look. Each zone has a distinct character, 'twould seem.
Cahciua's already gone ahead. Let's get going too.
