All aboard! We're castin' off!
It's time. I trust you have everything you need.
And so does our ship cast off from the docks.
We sail west, as Ketenramm did some eighty years past, bound for the “New World”—known to her children as the continent of Tural.
Just wait, Papa! When this contest is said and done, it'll be your daughter who sits the throne... Me, Wuk Lamat!
Smooth sailing so far?
Aye, so far, so good.
But this sea, she's a fickle one. Calm one moment, blowin' a gale the next.
I'll take my rest while I can, then.
We left port what seems an age ago now, and we've seen naught but open water ahead. I knew Tural was far, but it's another thing to really know.
Speaking of which, some of our fellow passengers have made this trip before─several times in fact. I was able to learn a few things about Tuliyollal and the rite of succession.
Since we still have a long way to go─why not have a chat with them yourself? I'm sure you have questions of your own.
Did you look out across these same waters, Grandfather...?
Have you spoken with our shipmates? Tural is still a good distance away, and it might be a pleasant way to pass the time.
I can feel my edge start to dull on these long sea voyages. How about some light sparring later?
Deep breaths... Deep breaths...
