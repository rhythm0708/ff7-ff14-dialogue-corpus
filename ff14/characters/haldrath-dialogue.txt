Aye... The wyrm lies broken and my father is avenged. With the wellspring of his vitality thus denied him, Nidhogg shall not linger long in this world.
But behold the terrible price we have paid. My sire is dead; so many brother knights slain.
We traded our honor for the strength which now courses in our veins. And still we are forced to make such sacrifice.
But not in vain, my lord. Hraesvelgr is the only great wyrm left in Dravania, and he dares not leave his lair.
With Nidhogg's eyes in your possession, who now can challenge the might of Ishgard? Ascend the throne, and take your rightful place as the ruler of our people!
Nay, my friend, I must forsake the mantle of king. Though Nidhogg be defeated, his wyrmling horde yet darkens the skies with wings beyond counting.
As one who partook of Ratatoskr's strength, it shall be my penance to bear a knight's arms until death grants me leave to retire. When that day comes, no prince shall perish, but a hells-bound hunter of dragons...
But Lord Haldrath! What then shall become of the royal line!?
