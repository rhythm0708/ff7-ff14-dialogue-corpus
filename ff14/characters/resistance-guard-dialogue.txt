Commander Kemp! Marshal Tarupin reports that their sweep of the castellum's interior has been completed!
So it's finally over, eh? Pray extend to him my deepest thanks.
It's official, then. Castellum Velodyna is well and truly ours. Mayhap this calls for─ Wait, where is M'naago?
She took her bird and flew off towards the Peering Stones─the village of the M tribe, where she was born.
I doubt that the imperials who fled Velodyna had a mind to give them trouble on their way back east, but she was nevertheless worried, so I gave her leave to go and see that her people were safe.
Though I pray you are right, 'twould be best if M'naago were not alone if she should encounter the enemy.
Agreed! Let's all go to the Peering Stones and make sure that everything is all right.
If that is your wish, then I've no objection. Just let the guard know when you wish to cross.
Greetings, Scion. Do you wish to pass?
The path to the village is through a tunnel just east of here. Follow me!
Ah, you've come. Welcome, friends, to my village. My home.
How fare your people?
Good, all things considered. Better than the Ananta, at any rate...They've sent an emissary. I'll take you to her.
We're here to help. Will you tell us what happened?
