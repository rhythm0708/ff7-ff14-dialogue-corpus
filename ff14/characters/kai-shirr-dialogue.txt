Wha─ I...I...
Forgive me, I just─ I have to get into the city!
I have no family, and all my friends have already been chosen.
No one here gives a damn about me. When the meol gets handed out, I'm lucky if I get a smell of it!
No matter what I do, they won't call out my name! I'm so tired─I'm so bloody hungry...
I thought maybe I could steal your idea─get in that way...
...What is your name?
Kai-Shirr...
Tell me then, Kai-Shirr─must it be Eulmore or nothing?
What of the Crystarium? They may not offer charity, but you would be fairly compensated for any work you did.
No, no, it has to be Eulmore!
That's where all my friends are. We made a promise that we'd live together in paradise...
...I was to make my deal with the Ondo at the Clave. Listen carefully, and I shall tell you my plans for the business, and how best to arouse the Eulmorans' interest.
You'll give me your place? Just like that?
I'm giving you a chance, nothing more. What comes of it is entirely up to you.
...I understand! Oh thank you, thank you!
This was but one path─there will be others. But for young Kai-Shirr, it was the difference between life and death.
I do not regret my decision...yet I will admit that a part of me wonders if it was for the best.
We strive to bring swift salvation to this world, that countless lives might be saved─not least your own. Even if it came at the cost of one man, should I have forged on regardless...?
I suppose not... Were Estinien here, he would most likely scoff at my soft-heartedness. “Same old Alphinaud. Ever the slave to sentiment.”
But I thank you for your kind words, nonetheless. Let us see to it that both these stories have a happy ending.
Indeed. We will find another way, I promise you.
Shall we return to Wright, then?
Is that...?
I can't be sure, but I-I think someone's in trouble!
Come on, they may need our help!
...That should take care of the worst of his injuries.
