Ah, another novice adventurer. Aye, Baderon has sent more than a few of your kind this way of late.
I am Sundhimal, one of the Yellowjackets tasked with keeping the peace in the city. It is also my charge to provide guidance in the use of this device. Fear not, I shall be brief.
Aetherytes are crystalline structures that tap into aetherial energies. They are primarily used as a means to travel swiftly from one place to another.
Return and Teleport─the most common transportation spells─make direct use of the aetherytes and their connection to the flow of aether.
And as these devices are found in almost every corner of Eorzea, any adventurer worthy of the name will wish to seek out and attune himself to each one.
Once you have expanded your horizons beyond the walls of the city, you will soon find yourself performing the act of attunement as a matter of course.
There is, however, no need for unseemly haste. The aetherytes found in and around the city will be sufficient for the present, I assure you.
Should you wish to learn more about aetherytes or transportation magic, I will be here to answer your questions.
