We have them now!
Keep it up!
Fire! Fire!
For freedom:
We constructed the Peacekeeper, the pinnacle of engineering and technology. This mighty war machine was designed to rid us of the Freedom Fighters, as well as any other potential threats to the peace we have so long pined for.Its artificial intelligence ensures that this singular function is carried out with cold and calculating precision. Indeed, the 10,000 Peacekeeper units we created have now routed every threat to peace...including us. All that remains is to stand and fight.
They could have accomplished so much good with their knowledge...
Resuming peace protocol. All life-forms must be eliminated to achieve peace in perpetuity.
Deploying perpetual war machines. Please stand by for order to fire.
Vital signs detected... Initiating extinction protocol in accordance with primary directive.
This is not at all what technology was meant for!
And when one asked, “What is the point?” there were none left to answer.
I did it! I killed them all!
I...killed them all...
I...killed them all...
