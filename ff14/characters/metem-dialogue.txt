Fellow citizens of Alexandria. Ever since our beloved queen's passing, you have understandably abided in grief. Sorrow darkens your once-bright faces.
But is this what Her Majesty would have wished to see? No, most assuredly not. You know this to be true.
If we are to honor her memory, we must reclaim our smiles. To that end...
That's right, friendsâ”€after a long hiatus, I am pleased to announce the grand reopening of the Arcadion!
The realm's finest fighters stand ready to entertain you in glorious and thrilling combat! Come and join us, I bid you, and let your cares be forgotten!
