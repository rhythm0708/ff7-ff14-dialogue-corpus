If it isn't Forename Surname, the Scions' rising star! Is there aught I can do for you?
You wish to win the trust of the people of Little Ala Mhigo! That is a daunting task, my friend, even for our own countrymen.
I would like nothing more than to help, but I'm afraid my name no longer carries weight with that lot.
I used to be a member of the Ala Mhigan Resistance, you see, but I left in favor of joining the Scions.
Though my allegiance may have shifted, my purpose remains ever the sameâ”€the liberation of Ala Mhigo. Yet whatever my reasons were, I abandoned my comrades, and they'll have nothing to do with me.
Now, while I may have no more friends in the Resistance, I know someone who does. Her name is Albreda, and she is a resident of Quarrymill. Say my name when you meet her, and she won't lead you astray.
