Sir!
What is it? Report.
An urgent message from Amarissaix's Spire, sir! A Highwind Skyways airship has taken fire from imperial forces in the skies over the East Shroud!
The vessel's engines were crippled, sir, and it was forced to make an emergency landing southeast of Nine Ivies.
Nine Ivies? Gods, this could not have come at a worse time. All but a handful of our forces are presently afield, dealing with the Ixal.
Forename─I know full well you have yet to be formally inducted into our ranks, but we have urgent need of your aid.
In all likelihood, the airship was bearing civilians, and if the reports are accurate, it will have come down dangerously close to Garlean-occupied territory.
Please make all haste to the area southeast of Nine Ivies, locate the airship, and ascertain the status of the passengers.
An adventurer!? What're you doing out here? No, wait─let's find some cover first...
The Adders' Nest sent you? How do I know you're not an imperial spy? You don't even have a uniform!
