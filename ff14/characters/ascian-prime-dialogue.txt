Come, mortals! Render up your souls, that Lord Zodiark might be reborn!
Ahhh, the power of Darkness surges... Tranquil as ice, vicious as fire!
Feel the might of our magicks combined!
Not even the laws of creation can withstand the tides of chaos!
Stubborn mortals... Very well, we will show you our true strength!
Know eternal despair! Fire and ice consume you!
Even without the blessing of Light... How is this possible!?
Aaargh!!!
What walls are these? Arrrgh! Damn you, Hydaelyn!
That she might regain the blessing of Light I had foreseen...
But she is grown so strong in it as to deny us our power.
Let us withdraw, Lahabrea. That power remains to us, at least.
Impossible!
Aaaaaahhh!
So you harnessed the Eye's power... A pity you spent it all. What will you do now, hero?

You!
In the distant past, King Thordan and his knights twelve fought and defeated Nidhogg.
Though the victory cost them dear, they were rewarded with a great prize: the dread wyrm's eyes, both of which have since been held in the Holy See's safekeeping.
The Eye you possess was Nidhogg's left, and long has it served as the source of the Azure Dragoon's might. As for its twin...
It has lain here, joined to the person of Haldrath, the first Azure Dragoon. For though he learned to harness its power, he was ultimately consumed by it. Even in death, his body decays not─a pitiful end for a fabled hero.
My Ascian friend. Long have you and your kind sown the seeds of chaos by teaching mortals the secrets of summoning.
But if you assumed that we would meekly serve as your pawns, then you are gravely mistaken.
You would raise a hand against us!?
By taking unto my flesh the soul of the legendary King Thordan, I am become a god─
