Esteemed adventurer,Should you chance to read this letter, I pray it finds you well. Much time has passed since you helped us to rebuild in the wake of that terrible disaster, but we still remember you most fondly.
Our lives continue to be hard, and every day brings new challenges. Nonetheless, we have regained a semblance of what we once had, and smiles are beginning to return to faces.
The morrow will be brighter than today─this we dare to believe now thanks to you. And should you yourself face hardship, I pray that you believe the same.
