As an advertising scribe, I create notices for events and products that you see posted to message boards.
Such information isn't exactly essential for adventuring, but I consider it job well done if people are aware of their options, and I'll keep striving to deliver information that may be of interest to adventurers.
Thank you always for your kindness and compassion.Communicatively yours,A Humble Advertising Scribe
