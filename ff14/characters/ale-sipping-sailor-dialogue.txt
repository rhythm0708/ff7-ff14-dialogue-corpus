Hm? What the hells is that chocobo chick supposed to be dressed up as?
Ryunosuke here is wearing a costume that mimics the ryu─dragons of the Far East. It is held that these creatures have mastery over water, and a sailor such as your good self may benefit from knowing about them.
Huh, if you ask me, it looks more like a sea serpent. Hold it... It wouldn't have anythin' to do with that thrice-damned primal Leviathan, would it?
I-I assure you there is no connection whatsoever. Far from causing disasters of water, the ryu is a benevolent beast that protects us from them. If you are interested in knowing more, I invite you to seek us out at the Aftcastle.
Is that right? Still, here in Limsa, we've got the Navigator. That's all the protection we need on the high seas.
Ah, yes! I understand the people of your nation look to Llymlaen to favor them with safe voyages. Be that as it may, disasters of water can strike beyond the bounds of the sea─in which case, placing your faith in the ryu could provide you with added assurance.
Hah, I suppose it don't hurt to have more friends in high places, as it were. Fine, fine, I'll go and see what this is all about.
Oh, what a relief to see the locals take an interest in the ryu! I daresay we have gathered enough people, so let us head back to the Aftcastle.
