Th-Thank you... I'm all right, I think...
Say, you were fighting with Queen Sphene, weren't you? Are the rumors true, then?
That Her Majesty isn't a living person. That her actual body is elsewhere─in the cloud or some such─and she uses a special power to appear before us.
I'd always wondered why the Alexandrians never questioned her true nature, but now I think I understand why.
She personally fought to protect us. That's enough for me to know she's a worthy ruler. It doesn't matter what she is.
To fight for her people is proof of her dedication to her people. Whatever she may be, she is our queen.
