Ho there! Heard there was a visiting expert who we might bother with a few questions. I take it you'd be the one?
Y-Yes... I am...
Wilfsunn and Bloewyda. Sharlayan's foremost researchers in the field of teleportation magick. ...And Moenbryda's parents.
It hath been some time. 'Tis... 'Tis good to see you in...good health.
Likewise, old friend! Bloewyda and I were most honored to answer the call. Never expected this reunion, though, did we, dear?
