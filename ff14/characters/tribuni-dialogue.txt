Yes, my lord!
Scion Surname! Your deeds this day are an inspiration to us all!
With the death of the praefectus, Operation Archon has entered its second phase. Even as we speak, the Maelstrom moves to blockade Castrum Occidens and Castrum Marinum.
And far to the east, in the Black Shroud, the Order of the Twin Adder advances upon Castrum Oriens.
Already, you have done much to advance our cause, performing such feats as are worthy of songâ”€but if our plan is to succeed, more is required of you.
Let me know when your preparations are in order, and I shall relay to you the particulars of your next mission.
Phase two of the operation is presently in motion. Our brothers and sisters of the Maelstrom are holding their own against Garlean forces upon Vylbrand and the Rhotano Sea. Ere long, the third phase will begin and you must take to the field once more.
The Immortal Flames shall strike at Castrum Meridianum by way of a diversionary maneuver. While the Garleans are thus locked in battle, you are to infiltrate the stronghold and bring down the magitek field that surrounds the Praetorium.
The staging point for the mission lies in the shadow of Castrum Meridianum in northern Thanalan, and that is where you must go. On your way there, however, I would ask that you make a brief stop at Camp Bluefog, one of our key outposts in the area.
The garrison, I am told, is in low spirits, and it would do our troops well to see the hero of Cape Westwind appear before them. For the good of our cause, please stoke the fire in their hearts.
