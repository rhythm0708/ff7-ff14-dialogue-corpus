Reactivating magitek field...
Our flames will clear the way!Prepare to strike again!
You fight well!Our brethren will hear of your brave deeds.
The enemy's assault on the city hath been thwarted.
I dread to think how we'd have fared without the Amalj'aa!
I will call unto my children.
The eikon waiteth in the heavens!My child shall bear thee to him!
They have answered Tiamat's call!
I never dreamed I would have the chance to ride a dragon!
We all made it here in one piece, I take it?
Twelve forfend I should make such a perilous journey again...
We bow down to none!
Stand firm! We cannot afford to lose!
The air is thick with aether...We are close.
This is not Bahamut, just a poor imitation!
Imitation or no, we would be fools to underestimate it!
Our efforts may have helped Arenvald and Fordola escape...
Is that the last we've seen of Bahamut?
Hopefully, Tiamat's wounds are not too severe...
