Buuz! Fresh buuz! Your choice of lamb or dzo! Guaranteed to satisfy! How many will you have, miss?
Eh? A Doman? Unless another Dazkar is keeping him in her yurt, he is not here.  More fool her if she took a Doman for a husband.
But enough about Domansâ”€let us speak of buuz instead! You cannot come to the Azim Steppe and not sample this most traditional of delicacies!
