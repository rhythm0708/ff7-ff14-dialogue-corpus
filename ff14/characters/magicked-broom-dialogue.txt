Krow ot emit! Swish-swish-aroo!
Such pernicious stains, you are. No matter...
Ssem a tahw, ssem a tahw! Swish-swish-aroo!
Ugh! Insufferable, the lot of you. I will spare you, but only this once. Now leave me be!
I doubt they will be quite so affable when next we meet.
Another chance to pique their curiosity, then.
Still you press onward? How foolish.
It has to be a trap... It's always a trap.
With wings of dreams, I bar thy path.
I conjure forth the garden's wrath.
Hold them fast with thorn and vine.
To death's embrace their souls consign.
Leannan sith! These cretins have sullied the sanctity of your garden. They must be dealt with!
Is there no end to these creatures?
If they think a few plants can slow us down, they're sorely mistaken.
