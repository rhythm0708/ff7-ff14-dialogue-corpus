On a windswept isle in the southwestern corner of the realm,
amidst the rolling waves of the Rhotano Sea, lies the maritime city-state of Limsa Lominsa.
To this haven for bandits and brigands, cutthroats and curs, seekers of both freedom and fortune, comes a lone adventurer.
Lone, yet not alone, for the hero's arrival has drawn the gaze of the nation's patron deity Llymlaen.
What realm-shaking fate has She descried in the churning waters of this mortal's future?
An' here's where we part ways, lass.
I'm off to the markets to deliver me wares, then it's on to the highroad for me.
Here, I want you to have this─by way of thanks for savin' me arse earlier.
Hey─you never did tell me your name, did you? Well, here's an idea...
Become the sort of storied personage I can brag about havin' met, an' I'll consider us square.
Through peril and hardship, discovery and triumph, may the Navigator guide this brave soul on her life's voyage...
Till sea swallows all.
