You've seen to the patients? How were they?
...Good. That's good. I knew they would enjoy meeting you.
I am concerned about Halric, though... I'll have to speak with the other carers, but I think his time may be near.
We shall leave you to have that discussion, then. I was going to take Forename to Mord Souq if you have any errands there that need doing...?
Well, I suppose there is one thing...
Would you pick up a nectarine from the markets, please? Cassard's caravan just passed through, so Rhon Ron should have some fresh fruit.
Come, then, Forename─there's something I want you to see. Right after we stop at Rhon Ron's stall, of course.
Oho, back again, are you? You need another taste of Rhon Ron's wares?
Actually, we're looking to buy a nectarine. Do you have any in stock?
Oh, yes! Nectarines, peaches, grapes! Fresh and juicy!
Hm... Given how richly you cracked your coinpurse with me, I might still owe you food... Here, take this one! Free of charge!
Gods, I've never seen a Mord merchant give away something for nothing before. How much coin did you spend here...?
Oh yes, I'll take a jar of honeyed worms as well.
Hm? Oh no! They're not for me! It's...an offering of sorts.
...Ahem, the worms, if you please?
Only the best wrigglers for you! Come again, my friends!
Right, that's our shopping chores taken care of. Let's head up past the aetheryte to the main tower─the view I want to show you can only be seen from its very top.
Here are your precious worms. That buys us a trip to the top of the tower, does it not?
