You are well come, Forename Surname of the Scions. As communications officer, it falls to me to issue you your orders, and provide guidance on forthcoming missions.
Your first mission is to infiltrate the imperial outpost at Cape Westwind and eliminate Praefectus Rhitahtyn sas Arvina.
All participating units are now in position and awaiting your arrival. Please proceed to the staging point and report to Lieutenant Adalbert.
This is but the first step in our bid to purge the realm of the Garlean menace. I shall pray for your success!
