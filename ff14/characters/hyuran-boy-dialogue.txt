A-Are the beasts all gone? I've been hiding, and...I'm too scared to go out and look.
O-Oh, that's a relief! I thought one of those beasts was going to eat me!
I wonder where Varshahn is... He's the slowest runner. I hope he got away.
Hmm... He could be with the other people from the palace. Maybe I'll see him in the square!
