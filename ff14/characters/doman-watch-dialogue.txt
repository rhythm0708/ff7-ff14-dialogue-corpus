You're in luck, miss. I was about to send word to Revenant's Toll about the Garleans.
Of late, I've seen small airships─likely from Castrum Centri─come and go from the Keeper of the Lake. Though I cannot say for certain at this distance, I believe they may be salvaging something from within the wreckage.
The castrum's supply lines have been cut for some time, and I'd wager they're desperately in need of spare parts and other equipment.
So it's true, then? The Ishgardians honestly fear that the wyrm might rise again?
Well, from here that seems rather unlikely...but if it's assurances they want, you've no choice but to inspect the corpse in its entirety.
Easier said than done, given the creatures which inhabit the wreckage─and the aforementioned Garleans who won't take kindly to your presence.
They're sure to fire upon an airship, so I'd advise a more stealthy approach. Take this boat and a few of your comrades to the base of the Agrius, then climb to the top. That's the only viable approach, I'd say.
Hmmm. This scaffolding seems sturdy enough.
What will we find in here, I wonder?
Nothing we cannot handle, surely.
Something tells me there are more nearby...
I dare not ask how they learned to use explosives like that.
Thankfully, their aim was poor.
There's no turning back now.
I like not the looks of that inductor. Best we get rid of it.
Leave it to me!
Well, I certainly wasn't expecting a gunship.
Come what may, you'll not want for succor.
I thought it would prove more of a challenge than that.
Did I burn it down too quickly for your liking?
Bah, another aerial assault?
Are we almost there? I fear my legs may give out soon.
