And my bag!
So you found the stolen goods. That's fine work.
This barrel was at Sheshenewezi Springs, mixed in with others bound for Tuliyollal.
The Landsguard would've presumed it part of the regular ceruleum shipments and waved it through. And once it reached its destination, it would have been retrieved, and its contents sold for coin.
The audacity... Do we know who's behind this?
As fortune would have it, I spied the leader of this operation being handed one of the stolen items.
A bracelet, which Vow Wuk Lamat had intended for her nursemaid Namikka.
I-It was from the Vow of Resolve!?
Oh, you've seen it, then?
No! N-No, never! And if I knew who had it, I-I would've arrested the scoundrel!
What's the meaning of this, Wihuwte?
I-It's a set up, sir! I...I have the bracelet, y-yes, but I─only 'cause I found it, I-I swear!
They're the real criminals! They concocted this scheme to frame me─so they could get me out of the picture!
If you feel your honor's at stake, there's always the old-fashioned way.
The law which folks have used to settle their differences for generations.
You don't mean...
Wihuwte─I challenge you to a duel.
The winner is right. The loser is wrong. Doesn't get simpler than that.
