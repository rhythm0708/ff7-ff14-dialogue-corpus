Well met, adventurer. What business brings you here this day?
...A letter? Very well, let's see it.
...Have you read this, adventurer?
I see. But you have some inkling as to its contents, I think.
Mistress Momodi has doubtless explained to you the significance of the crown, and what its loss could mean for Her Grace the sultana... <sigh> This theft shames the Sultansworn─and me most of all.
The blame is mine, you see. I grew lax in my duties, and in a moment of carelessness...
No, it will do no good to recount the tale now. Since the hour of the theft, we've searched frantically for any signs, any whispers as to the whereabouts of the crown. We have found nothing.
The identity of the thieves, and their motives, seemed fated to remain a mystery─until you arrived, bearing this ransom note.
In it, the criminals state their price for the return of Her Grace's crown.
And though it pains me to say it, I fear I have no choice but to acquiesce to their demands. Too much is at stake to do otherwise. The crown symbolizes Her Grace's birthright, and identifies her as the custodian of the Ul legacy. It must be recovered.
I will travel to the Unholy Heir and pay them their ransom.
Though I am not foolish enough to meet these men alone as they stipulate, I dare not bring a host of my comrades lest the thieves take fright. Friend─would you consent to be present for the exchange?
Mistress Momodi has always spoken of you in the most glowing terms, and I have never yet had reason to question her judgment.
On behalf of all those still loyal to the sultana, I beseech you─help us in our hour of need.
I've come as agreed! Now, show me the crown!
