Forgive me, but my shop's closed until further notice. Needless to say, we've more pressing concerns these days...
We have come not in search of wares, but information concerning the enormous fiend that tore through the bazaar. Did you perchance witness anything?
Afraid not, my friend. I was here the whole time, so I only saw its little minions. Made a mess of the place, they did.
While that was all going on, the great big one tore through the west side of the bazaar. You'd have better luck asking there.
...And with that, I do believe we've learned all we can from the bazaar. Let's take a moment to review our findings.
The beasts that attacked us here were scrawny little things, but they caused as much damage as that bigger one. Until the Radiant saw them off, it was all I could do to run for dear life...
