It's you! Forename Surname!
I-I served under Lord Gaius in the XIVth Legion. I was there on the night the Praetorium fell...
You and your adventurers... You killed them. My comrades, my friends... Swept them aside in their dozens, as though they were nothing to you...
...And maybe I am too. Just another faceless enemy to be cut down. But it won't be long until our countrymen returnâ”€until you get what you deserve. Mark my words!
I was ready to abandon all hope...until I saw you. You... Soon, very soon, we'll make you pay for every life you've taken!
Did you learn anything of note?
Then your findings are consistent with my own. Their plight is desperate indeed.
The sick and injured are at greatest risk. Without warmth and proper nutrition, I fear they will soon perish.
I realize there is precious little we can do for them at present, but I cannot bear to see them suffer.
Please, will you help me tend to them?
There are several people in the next carriage I have yet to speak with. Could you start there?
