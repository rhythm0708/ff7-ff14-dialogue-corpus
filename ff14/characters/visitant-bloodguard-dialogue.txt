Your aether will be mine!
I must feed!
If this beast would bar our path...
A simple enough task.
A simple enough task.
A simple enough task.
There is something to be said for the fortitude of nature.
Come. Let us press onward.
To the cavern!
So this is Lapis Manalis...
How vast is this cavern, I wonder?
