Oh, an unfamiliar face. I gather this is your first time on-site, then?
Well, this here's the storehouse. Or rather, the entrance. The real storehouse is underground, much more spacious, and equipped with a temperature regulation system to keep the harvest from spoiling.
Since the entrance is so small, it's much easier to prevent wild beasts from wandering insideâ”€which also makes it a viable facility for breeding and raising livestock. We've even got a few beds down there for emergencies.
My parents often complain about how Alexandrian technology and electrope complicate our lives, but it's just a matter of learning how things work.
Take my job, for instance. I'm presently overseeing the storage of harvested crops.
They'll be taken up to the tower for processing, and from there find their way to every dining table in Alexandria. The work is hard, I'll not deny, but I take great satisfaction in what we do.
I actually live up there. It's only for work that I come down to the outskirts.
