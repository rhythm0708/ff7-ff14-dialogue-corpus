Shut your mouth, you thieving little swine! You stole from me─don't even think to deny it!
P-Please, sir, I didn't steal nothin'!
I b-bought this─paid for it with me own coin!
What rot! You refugees are all the same─couldn't afford maggoty mole meat, much less a choice cut of dodo!
I'm going to say it one more time: give back what you stole, or I'll make you wish you'd never set foot in this town!
By rights, I should turn you over to the Brass Blades, you know─help keep the streets safe for law-abiding citizens. But I'm a reasonable man. If you agree to serve me in...whatever capacity I require, the authorities needn't hear of your crime.
B-But I ain't done nothin' wrong! Twelve as me witness!
P-Please, adventurer! Help me, I beg o' ye!
I swear on me mother's grave, I didn't steal nothin'! I bought this with the coin I'd saved...  I only wanted to treat me children to a decent meal...
And who the hells are you when you're at home!? This dog's master?
I've had enough of this mummer's farce. You lot, teach them a lesson!
