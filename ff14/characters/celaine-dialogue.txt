I'm no bardâ”€just a simple soldier. And it isn't a song I would willingly sing.
The lady has spoken. Seems to me there's nothing else we can do.
You would give up, just like that? We have a duty to accomplish!
Begging your pardons, but your comrade gave me to understand that an operation is due to be conducted presently.
Aye, dragon numbers are on the rise, and we go to cull them.
If you are not averse, we would lend you our aid. The operation would be better for the extra hands, and should you have occasion to employ the song in battle, we would be able to hear it.
...Very well. You may join us, but on one condition: you are to provide our forces with support only.
All right, we have work to do. The operation will take place at Twinpools, to the north and west. Let us present ourselves to the commander and offer him our aid.
And he throws a hissy fit when I do something spontaneous. Hmph.
Well, let's make ourselves useful, the only way a bard can.
