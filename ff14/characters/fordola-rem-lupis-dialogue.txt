Well, well. A rescue party, is it? We'll see about that.
Gah! Who in the seven hells are you!?
What took you so long?
Alphinaud, I need your help!
My lord, the prisoners!
See to your men, Pilus.
Uh─ As you command, my lord.
Your friends were a disappointment. But you...You will entertain me, will you not?
If we kill him, here and now, we can end this!
I have no need for this rabble.
Seven hells... Not even Father could do that...
Hm. You yet stand. Mayhap you have potential.
Better...but lacking nevertheless...
It would seem I misjudged you. This ends now.
Pathetic.
Seven hells...
Shall we give chase, General?
Nay. There has been enough death this day. See to the wounded.
Aye, sir!
You all right, lass?
'Tis no ordinary foe could best the likes of you.
Aye. I do not doubt it.
To best the likes of you... Zenos is not what I took him to be.
Don't you die on me, Y'shtola! Hold on!
Don't worry! It's going to be all right!
Alphinaud! Master Kemp is all yours!
Understood!
Don't just stand there gawping! Hold her down while I work!
The worst is passed, but without the proper facilities I can do no more.
Master Kemp too would be better served in the infirmary.Let us take them there without delay.
Give us a hand, would you, Lyse?
O-Of course!
I know you must be exhausted, but there will be others who need our help. Leave these two to us and look to the other wounded.
You did well, Forename. You saved lives. No matter what happens, remember that.
Now then─let's do what we can for the wounded. Every minute counts!
See to the wounded, Forename. If they live, help them. If not, move on.
