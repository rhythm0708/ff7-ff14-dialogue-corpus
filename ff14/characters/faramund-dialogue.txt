It is well to see you returned. Have you the medicine for our brother?
Gods bless you, adventurer! I'll see that Gallien receives treatment at once!
Hopefully, this will allow the captain to rest easier. It has been a terrible burden on him, trying to keep every man alive. You've done us a great kindness, friend.
A-Adventurer! Gallien has gone missing! He's nowhere to be found!
He shouldn't be walking about, not with those wounds! If he doesn't get the proper medicine and rest, his condition's like to deteriorate to where it was before...or worse.
We need you to help us find him, and quickly. Start by asking Albreda─might be as the woman's seen something!
Ah, finally. It's about time you came asking about Gallien. I watched him leave Quarrymill some time ago, and he left me this sealed letter before he went off. Made me swear not to open it until someone came asking...
“My brothers,I cannot bear to be a burden any longer. That is why I must leave you all. Do not worry for me─just find your way safely to Little Ala Mhigo.”
<sigh> Blast it. Would that I'd known what he was thinking. I'd have stopped this folly myself.
The love Gallien bears for his brothers is so strong, he's willing to sacrifice himself for them. Make no mistake, entering the wood in his weakened state is suicide.
Out in the wilds...alone!? That fool! That great big sentimental fool!
My men and I will scour the wood for Gallien! Please help us find him before something terrible happens!
