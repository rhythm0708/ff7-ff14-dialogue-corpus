A boy? Yes, ran straight past me towards the Greatloam Growery.
Straight towards the Greatloam Growery, like I said. Has he been up to mischief?
Did you learn anything?
So his name is Tenny...
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go to the Greatloam Growery!
I hope you and Saulinne find the boy soon. Perhaps someone in the area can help guide you to him.
Hello, Tenny!
