Forename Surname recognized...Welcome to the city of Amaurot.
Will you be riding the lift?
Wh─!? Did the building just welcome you?
Mayhap it is not so passing strange... Did Emet-Selch not invite Forename to visit his abode?
'Tis plain thy coming was expected.
And where will this lift be taking us?
The lift services every level of Achora Heights, but is presently configured to convey passengers directly to the ground floor.
Well, there you have it. In the absence of some few hundred yalms of rope, we have little choice but to accept the offer.
With emphasis on the we. I'm not about to let you walk into that place alone.
As you wish.The lift will arrive shortly.
Next stop: Ground Floor.Facilities include the Bureau of the Administrator, the Bureau of the Architect, and the Capitol...
It's only at this distance that you start to realize just how big the buildings truly are... What did that voice call the city? “Amaurot”?
Look! Over there!
Is that...a person? Ah, no, my mistake. That's a giant.
It doesn't seem to have noticed us yet...
Giant or no, a resident of this place may have much and more to tell us. I say we make the first move.
Alphinaud, you can't just─ Ugh!
Pray excuse my boldness, but might I ask you a few questions...?
