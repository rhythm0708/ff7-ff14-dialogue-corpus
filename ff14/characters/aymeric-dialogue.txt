Commander Leveilleur. It is both an honor and a pleasure to meet you.
I am Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights.
Alphinaud Leveilleur, at your service.
Your reputation precedes you, Ser Aymeric. I think we will find that we have much in common.
Speaking of reputations, yours towers over us all. Does it not?
