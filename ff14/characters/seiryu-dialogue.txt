When I heard that a celebration was to be held here in honor of me and mine, I wished to gaze upon its splendor with my own eyes... Byakko insisted I don this questionable attire, though he assured me that it would conceal my identity from unsuspecting mortals.
...Hm? A descendant of the maiden I spirited away now takes charge of this festival, you say? Most intriguing.
At the time, my intentions were not as benevolent as she believedâ”€whisking her away was but a means to appease my misguided worshipers. And yet...that her tale should endure this long is a testament to her gratitude. Perhaps I should give my regards to this bugyo of which you speak.
