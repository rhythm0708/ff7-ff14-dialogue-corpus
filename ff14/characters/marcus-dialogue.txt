How do I feel about the contingent? Conflicted, to say the least.
I've been tasked with the distribution of supplies, and I know as well as any that we couldn't survive without outside aid.
Be that as it may, even though the Empire has collapsed, we have our pride. People don't want to be beholden to others forever. And there's no denying that it chafes to see our benefactors occupying the imperial palace...
While our present welfare is important, we must be willing to endure hardship if it helps us to secure our nation's future. Strong leaders like Lord Gnaeus understand this.
Finished touring the enclave, have you? What were you able to learn?
Much the same as me, then. They accept the contingent's help out of necessity, and harbor a measure of resentment.
They have only themselves to blame. If they don't like the bargain, they should reject it.
