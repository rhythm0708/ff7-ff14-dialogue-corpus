Greetings, friend. By your dauntless bearing, I assume you are an adventurer. How might this minstrel be of service?
Ah, my dear friend, what a pleasant surprise this is! I trust you have been keeping well. Now then, how might this minstrel be of service?
So Nhagi's sister wishes to find him... Indeed, I have entrusted him with a task, and have an inkling as to where he might be.
As you may have heard, on the occasion of this Rising celebration, I am hosting an exhibit called the letter forest.
All are invited to anonymously submit letters to this forest and express their gratitude and encouragement for another, and all may peruse the letters at their leisure.
Now, in order to collect missives from outside of Ul'dah, I have dispatched a chocobo carriage. Nhagi is escorting said carriage.
When he contacted me on linkpearl a while ago, he said that they had emerged from the Twelveswood on their way back to Ul'dah. Given the hour, they should have already arrived...
I know not what is causing the delay, but might I trouble you to look for them? I would go myself, except I am needed here at present.
I'm truly grateful. In case it helps, the carriage was meant to pass through Black Brush Station, so perhaps you could take your search to that area. I pray that nothing has befallen them.
As I mentioned, the carriage was meant to pass through Black Brush Station. That may be a sound place for you to begin your search.
There you are. Were you able to learn aught of Nhagi?
Escorting a carriage for the minstrel, so that is the way of it...
As suggested, let us take ourselves to Black Brush Station and try searching in the vicinity!
