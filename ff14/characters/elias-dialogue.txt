Light levels appear to be fine. As for the power source...
Hm? You wish to know about my job?
I tend to the fields, mostly. Watering the crops, keeping the soil fertile, and so on.
It admittedly took some time until I fully understood how best to carry out my duties.
I also manage the lamps we use in the fields. We do our best to keep everything up to code, but should they ever start to malfunction, it's up to me to fix them.
The land and sky being what they are, ensuring a rich harvest makes for constant work. But honestly, I enjoy how involved the process is.
Both my parents being Alexandrian, I didn't grow up knowing much of anything about farming. Every day is an opportunity to learn and grow.
If you should ever take an interest in farming, I'd be more than happy to teach you what I know.
