Ah, walking one is a friend to these ones! Friendly like gracious elder one of forest city. Knows how to dance into these ones' hearts!
Forename! Would you like to hear the good news, or the better news? The good news is that your lovely dancing has brought smiles and high spirits to all of Little Solace! The better news? Why, I've thoroughly recovered from those accursed leg cramps! Onward to our next adventure!
Forename. As an adventurer, you're no stranger to helping distressed folk, I'd wager.
Tales of good deeds are quick to spread. The adventurer who comes to the aid of the local populace can go from stranger to hero o'ernight.
No doubt you see what I'm getting at. The sylphs who make their home in Little Solace do so having been driven from their woodland home. Surely, they have their fair share of troubles.
Seek out troubled sylphs, and see what might be done to ease their worries. A sound plan, would you not say?
That said, the sylphs are not known to share their worries with outsiders. You would be better off inquiring with Hearer Imedia; of the Gridanians who reside here, she is most like to be privy to the sylphs' troubles.
