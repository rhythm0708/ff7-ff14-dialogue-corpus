How'd you find me!? Bah! Guess I need to practice more.
Or maybe you're just good at this? I mean, the Garleans didn't find me...
Wonderful! All the children are accounted─ Hide-and-seek? Ah, I see that you are curious. It is quite simple, really.
Lady Yugiri thought it best that the children know what to do in case the Garleans found us.
I should hope that those days are behind us, but I nevertheless take comfort in knowing that we are prepared.
The first caravan is due to depart shortly, followed by the rest at regular intervals. My family and I─including my stubborn old father Homei─will be traveling in the lead carriage together with young Koharu, whom I believe you've already met.
Though I understand the road to Ul'dah is regularly patrolled by your Brass Blades, it would give us great comfort if you would agree to accompany us on our journey...
Once again, I thank you for your kindness. When you are ready to leave, please inform our coachman.
