Oh bugger, you were sent by the snake, weren't you!? I heard one in four recruits doesn't live through their training. That can't be true, right? Oh bugger, oh bugger...
All recruitsss are presssent and accounted for. My thanksss to you, ssstrider.
Not all appreciate the rigor with which I train my recruitsss. Sssome favor a gentler approach. As if the imperials will be ssso kind.
'Tis a thanklesss job, to teach, sssome sssay. But I sssay their sssurvival is thanksss enough. Fare you well.
