The world is not yours to end...
This is our future. Our story.
No... It can't be...
Bah, a trick of the light. You are a broken husk, nothing more.
How can you hope to stand against me alone?
We stand together!
How didâ”€!? ...I'm surprised you can stand at all.
I could not well leave matters half-finished.
Let expanse contract, eon become instant!
Champions from beyond the rift, heed my call!
Damn you! Damn you all!
Very well. Let us proceed to your final judgment.
The victor shall write the tale, and the vanquished become its villain!
But come! Let us cast aside titles and pretense, and reveal our true faces to one another!
I am Hades! He who shall awaken our brethren from their dark slumber!
