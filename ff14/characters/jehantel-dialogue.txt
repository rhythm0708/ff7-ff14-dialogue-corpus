Ah, another guest. You are kind to pay me visit, young one.
Naught gives us elderly folk more pleasure than the company of the young. Add to that a steaming pot of tea and the beauty of the Twelveswood, and we could want for little more!
Ah. But the curl of your lip tells me that tea and scenery are not what you desire. You seek knowledge of archery, I take it? In which case, I'm afraid I must disappoint you...Forename, was it?
Yes, yes, I am Jehantel, the one they called the Godsbow─but that was in another life. I have long cast aside my bow, taking instead a harp to my breast. For years, I have lived as a bard, going wherever the wind blows, exulting in the beauty of creation through song.
To be sure, I still have the eyes to recognize a promising archer when I see one. And you, young one, have promise. Keep your nose to the grindstone, and one day you may count yourself a virtuoso of the bow.
Yet know that virtuosity is worthless without virtue. Aye, the words of the Ballad of the Vainglorious Fool tell us this much.
...You truly wish to remain and learn poetry and verse? Well, well, well...I must admit to being rather taken aback.
In uncertain days such as these, there are few indeed who would devote their time to song as opposed to more “tangible” endeavors.
You intrigue me, young one. I find myself growing curious as to how the melodies of old might find expression through you.
I do believe a certain friend of mine would be of the selfsame opinion. Aye, that would be as good a place as any for us to begin.
Listen well, Forename. There is a moogle named Pukno Poki, who can oft be found wandering an area situated east of here. I would have you present yourself to him.
Pukno Poki is possessed of a discerning eye for talent. If he sees potential in you, I should be well satisfied that you indeed have the makings of a bard.
Heed me, O Puissant Althyk! Turn Thee over the hourglass of time, that we might gaze upon the battles of yore!
