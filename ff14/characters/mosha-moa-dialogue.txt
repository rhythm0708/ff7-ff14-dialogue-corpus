Good day to you, Mosha-Moa. This is my associate, Forename. We are here to collect the produce I purchased.
...Eh? I loaded your lackey up with the goods not long ago.
My lackey? I know of no such person!
Mystel lad, short blue hair? ...No? He said he'd come on your behalf, and since he seemed to know all the details, I just assumed...
Confound it. Someone must have been eavesdropping on our conversation...
If this charlatan was here not long ago, he cannot have gone far. We should split up and search the area. You find a vantage point on the south side of town, and I shall take the west!

Forename! Any sign of him!?
...You've a keen eye. Let us move in, before he makes good his escape!
There you are!
The thief who claimed the harvest on my behalf. Hand it over.
