Grrroooaaarrr!
Graaahhh!
There is no escape!
Grrroooaaarrr!
Graaahhh!
This is going well...
Vanity...
Beast of my blood, answer my call!
Rend my foes and ward their blows.
Hah, so you really are a monster.
Better a monster than a deceiver. A spinner of foolish dreams and false hopes.
There is no folly in hope!
Hmph!
...I said as much myself, once. I was wrong. Never again.
You but delay the inevitable!
Dammit! I need time to line up a clean shot.
Hmph!
I suppose if there's no other way...
There is no escape!
Begone!
When will you learn?
When you're dead and buried!
Yield now and I will grant you a quick death.
But we've only just begun.
What is this foolishness?
Not good...
The strain is more than I remember... At least now I can get that shot.
I tire of these games...
Show yourself!
Here!
Here!
Now I have you!
I know you're here...
Gah...
You would court death for mere parlor tricks?
<pant> <pant> ...My life would be but a small price to pay.
Then pay it you shall!
Hmph!
You never understood her.
She is not a bird to be locked away in a gilded cage.
And you presume to be her protector. Pathetic!
Looks like I'll have to use it again, then.
Again with these tricks!?
Urgh... Hold still, damn you!
No quarter!
No quarter!
Now I have you!
Ugh...
You have played your hand far too early, boy.
Hmph!
There is no escape!
This has carried on long enough, wouldn't you agree?
Why do you persist in this folly?
Is that all?
Minfilia's last cartridge... Have to... <pant> <pant> ...make it count...
There you are!
Damn...
Gah! But how!?
Fools to a man!
Bah!
I'd hoped you would fall for it a third time...
Urgh... Though two times was... <pant> <pant> ...perhaps already too many...
No more tricks? Then let us finish this.
<pant> <pant>
Is that all?
Guh!
Pathetic...
But you've not even seen the grand finale.
Just...a little more...
Fool.
One...last...disappearing act...
Were you not struggling to stand I might think you serious.
Oh, I am deadly serious.
Fool! You think the shadows will save you?
There is no escape! Do you hear me!?
Just...a little more...
Face me!
There!
Thank you, Minfilia...for this precious gift...
Come!
To hell with you!!!
Gaaaaaah!
You would have her suffer and die. I would spare her that fate!
That is not for you or anyone else to decide─ever again.
Not a single day goes by that I don't think about all that you have given me.
Countless memories and moments I took for granted... Gods, you grew up so fast.
But you had to, didn't you? For those you had lost. For those you could yet save.
A world teetering on the very brink of oblivion, for which you gave your everything without hesitation...
Your kindness, your compassion, your love... Then and now...
One last time, with a little help. I'm so proud to have been a part of your life...
Oh, Minfilia...
This is the place, Forename. This is where she stopped the Flood.
The last time I was here, when I felt her presence overwhelming me...I tried to pretend it wasn't happening─to just...turn away.
But I can't turn away now. Not this time. For Thancred and the others, I have to face her.
I can sense her presence, albeit faintly.
Come on, let's look over by the crystal wall.
Is this─
