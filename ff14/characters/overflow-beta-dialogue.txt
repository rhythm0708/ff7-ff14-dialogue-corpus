Eliminate. Eliminate.
Amazing... Yet another civilization...
Attacked as soon as you arrived!? Not the most welcoming of places, is it...
We must try to find denizens who are amenable to conversation.
We should also get the lay of the land, see how far we can go.
I'll help Alphinaud with that. In the meantime, you and G'raha can search for friendlier folk.
Apart from hostile beings, take care with your footing. I mislike the look of this terrain.
Not knowing what the locals are like, you'd best take care yourselves. We'll find you once we've finished exploring.
I expect the twins will seek the outermost bounds of the isle, so I propose we search the central area.
There are machines patrolling here and there. Sentinels, in all likelihood.
Like those you encountered, they will most certainly attack any who venture too close.
So let us avoid them, and look for others that appear more approachable.
