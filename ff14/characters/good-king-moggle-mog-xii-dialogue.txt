You shall suffer for your transgressions against my subjects!
And now our battle begins in earnest!
Mogglesguard, to arms! Your king has need of you!
Hearken unto me, brave Mogglesguard! These villains must be vanquished!
You did it, kupo! You did it! Good King Moggle Mog XII─may his mighty soul rest in peace─is no more!
I shudder to think what might've happened had you not stopped the Mogglesguard when you did. Thank you, Forename.
Perhaps now they'll come to their senses and stop playing at faerie tales. Rest assured that the chieftain will have choice words for them too!
You should go and tell Pukni Pakk that the king is no more, kupo! She's with Raya-O at Camp Tranquil, and can relay the news to the chieftain.
