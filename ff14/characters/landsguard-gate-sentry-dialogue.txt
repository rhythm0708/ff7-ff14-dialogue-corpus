I believe there's someone waiting for you.
Past these gates and over the bridge lies Xak Tural.
You have your permit, yes? Packed and ready? No last-minute stops to make before we leave?
<sigh> Forgive me. I'm afraid traveling with our new Dawnservant may have scarred me for life...
<sigh> Forgive me. I'm afraid traveling with our new Dawnservant may have scarred me for life...
This...is the gate to the golden city?
Two decades ago, your father bade me transcribe a letter to a scholar across the salt, petitioning the study of this place.
What he discovered was something the Dawnservant feared enough to seal away forever...or so we thought until the rite's objective became the city of gold.
But to think that Tankwa would be entrusted with its safekeeping! Had I known that doddering old fool carried a set of keystones, we might have spared ourselves those tiresome feats.
Great power sleeps here─and with it, you shall obtain your birthright.
So you say. Yet the new Dawnservants succeeded where I could not. Taking their throne will be no easy task.
The Resilient Son underestimates his own potential! There is no need for worry.
I have liberated the key from the Dawnservant's vault. You alone have the means to unlock the gate.
You will gain all you were denied. The rite, your father's shade─these bitter memories shall soon be forgotten.
Seize your future, Promise. Open the gate, and become the ruler you were destined to be!
I-It's working!
