Before the occupation I was a humble historian. While my duties leave me scarce time for aught else, I think it important that these momentous events be recorded for the benefit of future generations.
Primary sources are indispensable, and I had a mind to question a number of my fellow freedom fightersâ”€ask them their motivations for taking up this cause and so forth.
You may take down their statements in this log. And...Forename...thank you for your service. Now and ever after.
