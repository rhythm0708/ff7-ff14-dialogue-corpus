Eh? You want me to introduce you to the Resistance? Hah! Why the hells should I do that? Give me just one reason!
H-Haribehrt sent you!? Grrr, that worthless whoreson... He abandons his comrades─his woman─and now he has the gall to ask me for a favor!? Simply incredible...
I just... I mean... <sigh> Ugh. I realize Haribehrt was only doing what he felt was right. He's a good man. And if he trusts you, then that's all I need to know. You see that bloke there? That's Meffrid, a captain of the Resistance. I hope he can give you what you need.
