Hail to you, traveler! What brings you out this way?...Hm? Foreman Rothe bid you assist me? Well, far be it from me to turn down a helping hand!
I've been tasked with the restoration of this sculpture. Five years of neglect have not been kind, to say the least.
Fortunately, I've just the thing for it─rather, those deepeyes have it. If you could slay three and bring me their bristles, I would be in your debt.
There you are. Have you the bristles?
Ahhh, feel how coarse that is? That's why they're perfect for scrubbing the soot from this statue.
Beautiful, isn't it? The spitting image of Haldrath, first of the Azure Dragoons and one of Ishgard's founding fathers...
A symbol of everything the Dravanians despise, which is why they've taken to searing it with dragon fire every time they pass by.
But no longer will we suffer this desecration of our nation's hero. Soon this statue will be as it once was─a proud, shining testament to the determination of Ishgard, and a message to the heretics that we have returned.
The work may be hard and the conditions harsh, but as a proud Ishgardian, I could ask for no greater honor.
Are you for Falcon's Nest? If so, I've a favor to ask.
There's this knight, Ser Ysaudore, stationed at the Anvil to the west of here. She's always treated me with kindness and respect─more than I deserve, to be honest...
Anyroad, while you were away, she came through on patrol, and I think she might have left a package behind.
It's a bit of a detour, but would you mind returning it to her? My thanks to you, friend.
