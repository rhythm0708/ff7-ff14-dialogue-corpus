Dammit all... Power the Crossbridge and release the beasts! We can stop them there!
The walls hum with energy!
Let's deal with this quickly and get going!
Send in reinforcements! The commander will not tolerate failure!
Is this the best they can do?
If it is, we'll be through in no time at all.
We must be getting close to an exit.
Purging hostiles.
