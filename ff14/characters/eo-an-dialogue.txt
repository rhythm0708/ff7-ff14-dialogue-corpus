Agh! Th-That tickles! Enough! I never had a masterâ”€I'm not accustomed to it!
Not that I dislike your kind, you understand. On the contrary, we amaro were bred to be fond of men.
In the beginning, we were all of us mindless beasts. But then a mage of Ronka gave us the gift of intelligence, that we might better serve our masters.
After that empire fell, those with the gift eventually died out. On rare occasions, however, we are born with the seed of our ancestors in us.
If we live long enough amongst men, this seed may quicken, restoring the power of speech to us amongst other things. So it was with me...though I never had a master, as I told you.
