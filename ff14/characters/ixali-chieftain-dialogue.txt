Squaaawk! Attend me, all!
To us, this forest, Tinolqa, belongs!
Wisdom of Paragons, we possess! To our former glory, restore us it will!
From this tree, a great crystal we take! Unto Garuda, an offering we shall make!
Unfeathered ones and elementals, banish we shall! Our ancient home, reclaim we will! Squaaawk!
First squad, left flank. Second and third, right flank.
The rest, form the main host with me. It is high time we reminded our Ixal guests why we Quivermen are to be feared!
This position is yours, adventurer. May the elementals keep you!
Squawk!?
Interrupt us, you dare!? In your own blood, you shall bathe!
