Looking for work, perchance? If so, you couldn't have come at a better time.
We Stone Torches are sellswords hired by Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern to protect its interests. Our primary duty here is to keep the tracks clear of pests, and it is for this purpose that we require your aid.
I should point out, however, that it can be messy work, and liable to get messier still if you're ill prepared.
A single piece of gear can mean the difference between life and death. I'll not have it on my conscience that I sent an ill-equipped adventurer to an untimely demise.
See to it that your arms and armor are in order. When you are ready, present yourself to me again.
So you are ready for inspection?
Good. Everything appears in order.
Yet know that naught is guaranteed in this world. Fate is a fickle mistress, after all. At any rate, capable adventurers like you are few and far between, and I would not have you throw your life away.
I have had to bury too many comrades who brushed aside cracks in their hauberks and dints in their helms. No matter what you face, do not disregard the importance of gear.
Let's get to it then, shall we?
Ore wagons pass through this station every day─but not without incident.
Wagons coming and going from the Dispatch Yard to the south must pass through a tunnel by Fesca's Watch─a tunnel in which some genius saw fit to put an ore storehouse, creating ideal conditions for a coblyn nest!
So now the ore-loving beasts have taken up residence in a tunnel we dug, and we're practically delivering meals to their doorstep!
But no more. Inside the tunnel in question, you will find a narrow fissure where the coblyns hide. Use this silver ore cluster to lure out the creatures, then slay them.
