Baderon sent ye out here, did he? Then consider yerself welcome at the Skylift.
Look at that bloody cliff, will ye? One blast o' fiery hell from that huge dragon was all it took to split the ground in half.
Cargo still needs to get through, though, so this mess o' wood an' pulleys was our solution to the problem.
Well, one of 'em, at least. If the gods were kind─an' they ain't─I'd have about a dozen more workers to handle me growin' list o' headaches...
Glad I am to see ye again, lass. A wagon driver just returned in a great bloody hurry, screamin' about some monstrosity what sprang out from a millioncorn seedling in his cargo.
Seems the gutless bastard tossed it over the side afore turnin' tail an' runnin' for his life. I need ye to head down the road, recover that seedling, an' deliver it to Lyulf over at Swiftperch in western La Noscea.
Whatever he pays ye for the cargo is yers to keep. After all, I don't rightly know what else is lurkin' inside that plant, an' ye deserve to be rewarded for yer troubles.
Oh, an' ye'll also find an aetheryte in Swiftperch, so the journey should be worth yer while.
