Is some...there? Can...hear me?
...At last!
Who's there!? Show yourself!
If only I could. Alas, this gate will not open for me. Only the key in your possession can connect us.
Then...you are the guardian of the city's great power?
I do not claim this power is great... But the knowledge I possess is enough to realize any desire. To remake worlds.
Is that so...
Hahaha... Ahahaha!
Fascinating. Name your price, then. For my desire is the world itself...
Yes, yes! The Resilient Son rises! Together we shall create a nation worthy of our rule!
P-Promise! Wh-Why?
The useless tool is cast aside.
Deliver me a new world. One that bends to my will.
As you wish. But in exchange...
Ready to get underway?
Then present your travel pass to that guard, and let us be off.
You won't have to wait long to enjoy sightseeing. The bridge to Xak Tural is a wonder in its own right.
Go on, show your travel pass to the guard.
This gate is barred to all save those with express permission from one of the Dawnservants.
...Signed by Vow Wuk Lamat herself! My apologies, miss. If you would wait here just a moment.
Shall we, then?
On the far side of that great bridge unfolded the wilds of Shaaloani—“where the sun guides” in the Shetona tongue.
A harsh guide, to be sure, with its blazing rays scorching the land and hardening its inhabitants.
But sweeping change had come to the arid expanse when, beneath its red crust, vast deposits of ceruleum were discovered.
Embracing this opportunity, Vow Koana's supporters hurtle on, driven by dreams of a future illuminated by blue flame.
It is here that our journey continues, our path taking us along wending roads of steel. Each length of track a declaration of hope—and ambition.
My home, Yyasulani, lies past Shaaloani.
It will be a long journey, but the railroad should make it easier.
As for the way to the train station, let's ride these fellows, shall we?
