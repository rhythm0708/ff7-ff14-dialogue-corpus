My son, they...they told me he walks in Halone's halls. Him and the rest of his unit.
...They told me the same.
I expect they think it's comforting.
Every time I come, I cry. I cannot bear to remember, but to forget would be a thousand times worse.
Yet that is what they would have us do. Accept this truth for the sake of peace. Bury the past and look to the future.
But he was my future. My flesh and bloodâ”€my heart...
