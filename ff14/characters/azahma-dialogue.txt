Yes, I am Azahma. And who might you be?
...All true, I'm afraid. My friend took a ship out in search of Alzadaal's Legacy, and I've been watching for his sails ever since.
I tried to dissuade him, of course, but he refused to listen. All he could talk about was finding that vault.
And that look in his eyes... I knew it wasn't common gold or jewels he lusted after. He was hunting Alzadaal III's “otherworldly” hoard, and his ambition would not be denied.
I see it in you, too─that appetite for the mysterious and the unknown.
But I'll not attempt to turn you from your path. I know too well the futility of that endeavor.
So I will tell you what my friend told me─how he convinced a merchant in the bazaar to give him the rough location of the vault's entrance.
It seems this merchant─one Zasshal, I believe─is selling a map which shows the exact route, but my friend's purse was too light for its exorbitant price.
With what meager wealth he had, he instead paid to learn that there are ruins on a small island somewhere in the Bounty. And within those ruins hides the path to the vault deep below.
If you truly intend on seeking Alzadaal's treasure, I suggest you put your affairs in order. I wish things were different, but I do not believe my friend is ever coming home...
