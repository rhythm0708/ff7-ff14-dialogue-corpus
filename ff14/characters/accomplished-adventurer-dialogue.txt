Spare me your talk of glory and fame─I'm not in the habit of volunteering for lost causes.
I've survived this long by trusting my instincts, and my instincts tell me to stay well away from Ishgard.
Ishgard sounds like she's in a right mess...but that ain't what I wanted to talk to ye about.
I need ye to cast yer mind back to that scuffle with the Empire out by the processin' plant. A lad from Little Ala Mhigo by the name o' Wilred was there with the 4th that day, an' I want to know if ye've seen him since. Have ye?
Godsdammit, I feared as much... No one's bloody seen him. It's like the ground opened up an' swallowed him whole.
But that ain't all. Around the time Wilred stopped turnin' up for duty, them black market weapons went missin' from our vault in Ul'dah...
So now, o' course, half the Braves suspect the lad o' makin' off with the goods.
Folk like to believe our company's a disciplined fightin' force, but as you an' me both know, it's no more'n a motley collection o' mercenaries, adventurers, an' Grand Company veterans.
The only thing as binds us together is some vague oath about fightin' for the freedom of all. That an' the steady pay.
Now, compared to most others in this crew, Wilred's a fresh-faced novice─a bleedin' whelp amongst wolves.
But the boy's got passion. When he talked about bein' a guardian of Eorzea, he bloody well meant it. A lad like him wouldn't rob us blind an' bugger off like that. He ain't the type.
An' then─an' this is just between you an' me, mind─there's the fact that the lad wanted to tell me about somethin' queer he'd noticed in the ledgers. Somethin' about the Braves' numbers not addin' up...
Aye, there's a villain at the end o' this trail I've stumbled on, an' I'll bet me good eye it ain't young Wilred.
Anyroad, ye've got a war to wage, so I'll let ye get on. I just thought someone should know... I'll be seein' ye, Forename.
