If you would come this way, I will direct you to the bridge.
Welcome to the bridge, everyone!
I hope you have everything, because I can't be bothered turning back.
Right then, make yourselves comfortable. We're setting off in just a moment.
It's...incredible...
This is Fourchenault. Can you hear me?
The preparations for the summonings are complete.
In accordance with the fourteenth phase of the plan, we have moved the Ragnarok to the launch site.
The gates are open. You may depart when ready.
So...are we ready?
As ready as we'll ever be. Let's get going.
Oh, come on! A burnt-out star's got more fire in its belly!
Try it again─with feeling!
Me!? B-But I...
No need to be coy, Brother. Do it, and do it well!
If you all insist...
Onward—unto the distant stars and beyond!
Ragnarok, engage!
E-Engage!
