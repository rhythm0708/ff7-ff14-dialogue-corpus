We must tread carefully.
Your lightning won't save you now.
Let's keep moving.
They have the advantage here.
Even so, we must remain calm.
They'll not defeat us through sheer numbers.
This one appears stronger than the others, but it matters little.
I leave the vanguard to you.
<pant> <pant> ...Is it over?
Nidhogg is close. I sense him.
Watch out!
Seven hells!
We must rout them quickly, ere they overwhelm us.
This ends here, Nidhogg!
Halone grant us strength!
Impudent mortal!Thou wouldst use mine own eye against me!?
Tremble at my fury!
Attend me, my kindred!Slay these treacherous children of man!
My rage will consume you!
We shall see whose rage is the greater!
Treacherous mortals!
Thou wouldst use mine own eye against me!? Time hath done naught to dilute thy kind's depravity!
I have not forgotten thee, dragoon! Mine essence claimed thee once...and shall do so again!
No, wyrm! This ends here!
You gifted my people a thousand years of suffering. Now I gift you an eternity in darkness!
