It has been fifteen years, but the bitter taste of defeat lingers still...
	      Fifteen years since the imperial fleet set course for Mor Dhona,led by the Agrius, mightiest of all vessels.Silvertear Lake lay ripe for the taking,and all of Eorzea would soon be ours......or so we believed.But an innumerable host of dragons met us that day,at the heart of which flew the great Midgardsormr.Though we succeeded in slaying that lord among wyrms,the dread serpent's defeat was bought at too high a price.Our invincible flagship was lost,and all hope of victory with her.So ended our glorious conquest.
Eorzea... A blighted realm, riddled with false gods...
Twice now it has eluded the Empire's grasp.
For all the destruction it wrought, even Meteor, the Great Sin, failed to yield us control over it.
And for this failure, the realm has sunk deeper into depravity.
It is twisted beyond all reckoningâ”€rotten nigh to the core.
Yet it must be saved.
Only Garlean rule can bring order to Eorzea. It falls to us to deliver the misguided masses from their ignorance.
