But why!? Why must I die!? By all that is holy, I swear to you that I have never questioned the teachings of Halone!
Inquisitor! Release the maid and come with us!
My lord Drillemont─what is the meaning of this interruption? You are aware that I am at present conducting an interrogation, are you not?
Silence, villain! I name thee heretic, murderer of Inquisitor Guillaime and countless innocents!
You are a traitor to Ishgard, to your own kith and kin! Your sins are beyond measure─beyond redemption!
Ah...grave allegations indeed. But you will find your logic is flawed. How can I betray that which I owe no allegiance? No, Lord Drillemont─my conscience is quite clear, I assure you.
I wonder...can you say the same? You whose hands are black with the blood of those whose only sin was to question your nation's crazed crusade!
You speak to me of Ishgardian innocents? Hah! All are complicit in these crimes, for all live their lives by the archbishop's lies.
But I know you will not hear me, deafened by dogma as you are. If you desire retribution, Lord Drillemont, then come─let us see how Ishgardian steel fares against Dravanian fang and claw!
