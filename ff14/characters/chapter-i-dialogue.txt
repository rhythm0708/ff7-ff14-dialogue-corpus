In the distant past, the Milalla abided in peace upon isles of eternal summer. Winter never visited that bountiful land, and the flowers ever bloomed in all the colors of the rainbow.
But such idyllic days did not last. For just when it seemed the westerly wind had turned cold, the seas suddenly froze over. From the fish in the water to the birds in the sky, all of the animals soon perished.
This unnatural weather continued with seemingly no end, and one by one the Milalla fell until the death toll was beyond counting. Those who lived still could do naught but pray as they huddled together for precious warmth.
