Not bad, if you ask me. The adventurer pulls a good bow, and is enthusiastic besides.
A pleasure to meet you. My name is Leih Aliapoh, and this is my second year at the guild.
It's quite plain that you have talent with a bow, but you must take care to mind your surroundings when you're pursuing a target.
I had my eye on you for the duration of your trial, but not once did you notice my presence.
