Hm? 'Twould seem the Hall is host to a most precocious visitor this day. And what, pray tell, shall be the subject of our discussion, young one?
Ah...the Convocation and their handling of the coming peril. 'Tis only natural that you should have questions.
Shall we begin with the members themselves? As all know, the Fourteen are the wisest and most puissant among us. They are the stewards of order, responsible for decisions which keep this star turning season after season.
Be it the speaker, Lahabrea, or the emissary, Elidibus, each seat is occupied by an elected sage of surpassing intellect.
Loghrif, Mitron, Emet-Selch... Their individual titles have, as a gesture of respect and a matter of tradition, become synonymous with their incumbents.
Thus it is with great incredulity that I greet this recent rumor that a seat in the Convocation is soon to be left vacant.
If proven true, 'twould be an unprecedented developmentâ”€and testament to the immense pressure under which our saviors are toiling... In any event, I for one am confident they shall deliver our star unto salvation.
