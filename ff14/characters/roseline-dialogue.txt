You're here on Keitha's behalf? Hm? I see. Broke one of her eggs, you say? And there were four of the creatures?
The Qiqirn are a nuisance at the best of times, but we must now add trespass and chocobo murder to their list of transgressions... They have forced our hand. Our retribution must needs be swift and decisive.
And who better than you to deliver it, adventurer? Find the lair to the west of here and make an example of exactly four Qiqirn scramblers. We can send no clearer message.
The deed is done? Good. A grim task, but a necessary one.
You have shown them the folly of inciting the wrath of those who consort with adventurers. Perhaps now the Qiqirn will think twice before giving in to their larcenous proclivities.
