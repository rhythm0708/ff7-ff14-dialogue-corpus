A stirring story needs a formidable antagonist, one who stands in the protagonists' way and causes them sadness and suffering.
When the heroes finally overcome that foe, they will know a joy that is as sweet as their struggles were bitter.
Those who shared in that joy will go on to become friends true, their bond transcending age, station, and nations.
In order to create such depressing lows and soaring highs, I will strive to conceive of more compelling antagonists.Dramatically yours,A Humble Playwright
