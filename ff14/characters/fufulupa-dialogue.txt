Greetings and salutations, adventurer. To what do I owe thisâ”€ What, you've slain how many swarms of sun midges!?
You have my sincerest thanks! The Brass Blades have been struggling to keep them in check, so your assistance is greatly appreciated.
Will you be staying in Horizon long? If so, there is much and more you can do to help here.
Pray allow me to enlist your aid, brave adventurer. I would have you ascertain the whereabouts of a missive I sent to Lost Hope the other day.
Captain Leofric is stationed there. Ever since he was transferred, we've exchanged letters, but never before has it taken this long to receive a reply.
And so I fear that the courier may have met with some misfortune en route.
She must have made it to central Thanalan, or the Brass Blades that patrol the roads between here and Scorpion Crossing would have seen something. But, if she made it as far as Black Brush Station, she would have surely delivered the letter by now. Lost Hope is practically on its doorstep...
I suggest you focus your search on the road to Black Brush Station, in central Thanalan. With luck, you will find her quickly.
