Time for the chain!
...Yes, it's ready! Go, Angelo!
Argh! Wh-What sorcery is this!?
<huff> <huff>
Alisaie, are you all right!?
Ugh, his tempering is too severe... <huff> I can't finish the job...
This is only the beginning.
So one person's aether alone is not enough...
Ugh, just what we need...
They're targeting Alisaie! Everyone, gather close!
Everyone back! I will shield Alisaie!
Alphinaud! Let us lend Alisaie our aether!
Understood!
They can come from anywhere. Stay alert.
Here it comes, Alisaie!
Here you are, Alisaie!
Aye, Admiral.
Thanks, you two... I'll give it another try!
Bombs! We can't let them get near Alisaie!
Ungh... I am nearing my limit...
Curses, more of them... Spread out and hold them off!
Just a little more!
Seven hells, there's too many...
Leave this to me! Stand clear, all of you!
Argh...
Of all the reckless things... Alisaieâ”€now's your chance!
All right! Please... Please let this work!
Ahhh! My head! The pain, the pain!
Ungh...
<huff> <huff>
Is it still not enough...?
<huff> Almost there... <puff> Forename, please lend me your aether too!
