M-M-MONSTER! AAAAAAAAAHH!
Did she say monster!? Damn it all! The people are starting to panic!
Please, Forename, you've got to help us. I'll stay here and try to keep the crowd calmâ”€you head north and find that woman!
That scream sounded like it came from somewhere north of here. If there is a monster, I need you to handle it!
