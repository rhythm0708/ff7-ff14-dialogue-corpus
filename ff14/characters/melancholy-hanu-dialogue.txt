Ugh... Without Ihih'hana, life feels so empty...

Thank you for letting me know. I would very much like to attend the festival, but the repairs should be finished as soon as possible. What to do, what to do...
<sigh> There's nothing to look forward to anymore...

The festival is about to begin? What do you expect me to say...
...besides “Of course I'll be there!” Cleaning up the storm's aftermath may have been hard on us all, but the Lifting of Wings is tradition! And a joyous one at that!
I won't sit here brooding my days away! Give me a moment to get ready!
