Gah! Why won't you move, damn it?
Hey, do you know if there's a garage nearby?
<sigh> Just my luck to have a breakdown in the middle of nowhere... What is this place, anyway?
Thanalan? Eorzea? That's on no map I've ever seen.
I'm not sure how I got here, and I've got no idea where I need to go...but I'm going nowhere at this rate. Isn't there anyone around here who can fix cars?
Seriously!? Man, what a relief...
Wait, what? Cid is here too!? What in the world's going on...?
Anyway, might as well keep pushing her along.
Hey, mind giving me a hand? She's heavier than she looks.
What's your name, by the way?
Appreciate the help, Forename. My name's Noctis, but you can call me Noct.
And now that we're introduced, let's put our backs into it. <sigh> Talk about deja vu... Un. Believable.
