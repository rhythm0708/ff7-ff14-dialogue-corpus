Pardon me, are you an adventurer? Allow me to introduce myself, I am...er...
If it isn't my favorite adventurer! You do remember me, don't you?
...Perhaps I should remove my beard.
Much better! Starlight celebrant Amh Garanjy, at your service. I am ever so pleased to meet you during this most sacrosanct of seasons.
In commemoration of the Ishgardian knights who once sheltered needy orphans from the cold, we strive to deliver joy and comfort to all younglings each Starlight Celebration.
This year, we pay particular tribute to the figure at the heart of Starlight legendâ”€the snowy-bearded captain dubbed the Saint of Nymeia. As you can see, we have commissioned replicas of his red coat and fluffy white beard.
How better to delight the children than by distributing presents as the saint himself, after all!
So far, we have been successful in spreading Starlight cheer. However...
It seems there is a particular youngling who finds our felicitous festivities distressing.
Were I free to wander, I would reach out to them myself and provide what aid I could. Alas, my duties as celebrant require my attendance here.
Might you assist this child in my stead? I am sure they would welcome the insights of an adventurer such as yourself.
I am most grateful. Let me summon the young lady who first brought this matter to my attention.
