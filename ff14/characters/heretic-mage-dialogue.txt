Yes...yes...excellent.
My lady, everything has been accounted for. If there is aught else you would have us do, pray speak, and it shall be done.
It seems as though we are always one step behind, our quarry ever just beyond our reach. Though I would like to believe that the tables are about to turn, I must confess to having certain doubts. A joint effort may succeed where others have failed...but it could yet yield the selfsame result.
Fortunately, we are not without other options. I trust you haven't forgotten Inquisitor Guillaime?
We have not. The mystery of how the heretic remained undiscovered for so long has been much in our thoughts, as has the question of what steps might be taken to prevent a similar breach of security in future.
Accordingly, we conducted an exhaustive─and covert─evaluation of everyone in Whitebrim Front.
Though some were found to have committed certain minor transgressions, we identified only one possible heretic.
If this man has pledged himself to Iceheart's cause, he will have taken note of the movements of the Temple Knights and the Crystal Braves. And upon recognizing their intent, he may attempt to warn the heretics.
The man's watch is to end soon, at which point he must report to Ser Jeantremont in the yard. I would have you keep an eye on him. If he ventures beyond the walls, follow him discreetly.
Should he meet with a heretic, do not interfere─simply watch and listen. I have seen to it that the suspect knows nothing which could endanger our plans.
