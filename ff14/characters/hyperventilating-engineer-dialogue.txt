No cause for concern...even though we may need to depart at any moment...and if the hull I designed buckles under the strain, the entire vessel may explode on launch, claiming countless lives and dooming all mankind...but that is highly unlikely! Yes, yes, highly unlikely... Highly...
...Our visitors can help me triple check for structural flaws, you say? Why, that would be wonderful! I'm breathing more easily already.
