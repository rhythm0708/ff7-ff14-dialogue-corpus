Hey, no touching! That merchandise is spoken for! You couldn't possibly change my mind with a better offer...
...What? Cassard sent you!? Wh-Why didn't you say so? I wouldn't dream of selling his goods to a higher bidder! Oh no, no, no!
Nabaath Areng relics, wasn't it? All packed in that box there. Handle with care!
Don't tell me you've been round the entire market already!?
Aye, that's the lot, all right. Good work.
And quick work, too, considering you've not set foot in the place before. I'd thought you one to sit in the city like the Exarch, but something tells me you're not a stranger to visiting strange lands...
Unfortunately, your efficiency presents something of a problem. I'd hoped to conclude all my business before you returned, but it seems there's been some confusion over one of the orders I placed.
I'll have to drag in my middleman and sort this mess out. I'm sorry to make you sit around and twiddle your thumbs...
