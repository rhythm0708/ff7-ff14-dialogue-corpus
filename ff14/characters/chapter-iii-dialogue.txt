Since ancient times, the Milalla have excelled in calculations. By using formulae and figures to represent all natural phenomena, they had succeeded in devising a unique system of magic.
This gift proved invaluable in their new homeland, where they employed their calculations to etch arcane circuits upon the ore which later came to be known as electrope.
Through this ingenious technique, electrope was transformed into a tool that could not only store lightning, but convert it into energy of any element.
