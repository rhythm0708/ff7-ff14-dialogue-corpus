What shall it be tonight, Capâ€” You're not the captain!
I'm not one of them! I swear it on what little remains of my virtue!
Who are you!?
Who are you!?
Who are you!?
Who are you!?
Back fer more, eh? I sharpened me blade, just fer this very occasion.
Squawk!
Scurvy Scurvy dog! Squawk!
What do you see now? Nothin'! Nothin' at all!
Eat 'em alive!
Eat 'em alive!
Batten down the hatches! Batten down the hatches! Squawk!
Cap'n is strong! Cap'n is strong! Squawk!
M-M-Might ye consider a parley?
Parley! Parley! Parley! Squaaawk!
He won't escape next time!
