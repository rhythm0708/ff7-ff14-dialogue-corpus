You are the Gridanian envoy? Welcome to Limsa Lominsa.
The Admiral has been looking forward to your arrival.
Please proceed to the Crow's Lift at your earliest convenience. It will take you to Bulwark Hall.
Once there, pray speak with Zanthael. He will be pleased to show you in to the Admiral's command room on the Bridge.
Greetings, madam, and welcome to our fair city. If you would permit me to examine the seal on the missive you carry...
Yes, everything seems to be in order. My apologies. We cannot afford to be complacent, you understand. Please, step this way.
Enter.
I did not expect the Gridanian envoy to be an adventurer. It speaks highly of your character that the Elder Seedseer would choose an outsider to represent her nation's interests.
This way.
I bid you welcome.
I am Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn, Admiral of Limsa Lominsa, and commander of the Maelstrom.
Now, what news from the Black Shroud?
Hm. A memorial service to honor the fallen.
Seven hells... Has it been five years?
Five years since the Garlean Empire sought to wrest Eorzea from our grasp...
It was in answer to the imperial threat that the city-states formed the Grand Companies, and forged the Eorzean Alliance anew. But Garlemald was not content to wager all on a simple contest of martial might. They had other plans─the Meteor project.
Legatus Nael van Darnus─hells take him─intended to “cleanse” our realm by snatching the lesser moon, Dalamud, from the heavens and casting it down upon our heads. Desperate to prevent this lunatic scheme, we marched our forces to the Carteneau Flats and there met the VIIth Imperial Legion in battle.
Never have I seen a fight like the Battle of Carteneau─and I have seen full many.
But though we gave no quarter, spared not one onze of effort...we could not prevent what followed.
From inside the shell of Dalamud came a winged nightmare─a dragon the size of a bloody city. 'Twas the elder primal Bahamut, bent on making an eighth hell of Eorzea.
In the space of a breath, the legions of the Empire were set aflame, while our own armies fared little better. 'Twas as if the whole world was burning... Words cannot well describe the scene.
And yet...by some miracle, a few among us were spared.
Even as I steeled myself for death, a blinding white light enveloped me, robbing me of my senses.
When I regained them, the dragon was gone, and the still-smoldering land was warped beyond all knowing.
Were Archon Louisoix still with us, he would doubtless shed some light on these unfathomable happenings. Alas, he is not, and I fear we will want for his wisdom in the days to come.
For while our nations struggle to recover from the devastation, the beastmen call forth their damned primals to torment us anew.
Unless we put aside our differences and rebuild now, our foes will catch us unprepared.
And I speak not only of the beastmen. Do not imagine that the Empire has forsaken its claim on Eorzea. The imperials crowd our borders, waiting to strike.
Damn it all, we need champions to replace those we lost...
But such thoughts are worse than worthless. Time is short, and none will save us, save ourselves. It is the duty of every soul who survived the Calamity to work together for the good of Eorzea...and this memorial service may be the very thing to unite us.
Aye, Kan-E-Senna has the right of it. I accept her proposal.
Your duty is done here, adventurer─I will see to it that the Elder Seedseer receives my reply.
You travel next to Ul'dah, yes?
Pray give my regards to General Raubahn. Oh, and tell him the wolf has been sniffing around the stables. A private jest─and one in poor taste─but I would have you tell it all the same.
Fare you well, Forename. May the Navigator guide you on your journey.
Greetings, madam. This is the counter for passengers traveling to Ul'dah.
A pleasure to serve you again, madam. Are you ready to board the airship to Ul'dah?
Very well, madam. I'll be glad to assist you when you are.
Ah, you must be the envoy from Gridania! Welcome to Ul'dah, madam. The Flame General awaits your arrival.
Please let me know if you require any assistance.
Welcome to Ul'dah, madam. We have been expecting you.
Flame General Raubahn will receive you in the Fragrant Chamber. Please take the lift down to the Hustings Strip and speak with Bartholomew at the Royal Promenade.
The Gridanian envoy, I presume? Would you be so good as to allow me to inspect the missive you bear, madam? My thanks.
Ah yes, the seal of the Elder Seedseer. Please proceed.
Ah, a guest from Gridania. I thought I smelled leaf mold.
I won't hold it against you. If you're half the warrior Kan-E says, 'tis a wonder you don't reek of dead Ixal.
Welcome to the sultanate of Ul'dah. I am Raubahn Aldynn, General of the Immortal Flames.
But you did not come all this way to trade formalities.
...Carteneau. Aye, I remember bloody Carteneau.
Do you know what happened that day, adventurer? When we took the field against the Garleans?
So my counterparts have educated you.
Hm? Oh. Trust Merlwyb to make light of our wolf problem. Woman always did have a black sense of humor.
Wolves are bloodthirsty beasts upon which one cannot turn one's back. 'Tis only a matter of time before they bite.
So it was with the Garleans, fifty years ago.
No sooner had they learned how to use magitek than they began seizing territory from their neighbors.
Led by then legatus Solus zos Galvus, they swiftly brought the other nations of Ilsabard to heel. And so the legatus became an emperor, and his republic an empire...
An empire which then set its sights upon Eorzea.
But the conquering emperor is now an old man of four score winters. His health is failing, and he has no clear successor. Like as not, this is why the Garleans have been quiet of late.
But the XIVth Imperial Legion is still entrenched within our borders.
And their commander, Legatus Gaius van Baelsar, has long harbored ambitions of conquest.
Were he to strike now, I fear we would fall like so many others before us. And not only Ul'dah, but Gridania and Limsa Lominsa as well.
For the Calamity brought the lot of us to our knees, and we've yet to get up. We barely have the strength to stand against the beast tribes, never mind the primals they mean to summon.
We are a realm divided, adventurer. An alliance in name only.
But the wolf cares not for the plight of its prey.
The Garleans stir, and the Admiral would not let it go unnoticed.
All other concerns pale in comparison to the Empire─even the beast tribes and their bloody primals.
We must stand united once more, that much is clear. And if we're to do so, we must remember the cause which last brought us together. Kan-E will have her memorial.
We will honor the memory of the fallen. We will remind the people what their brothers and sisters fought and died for.
Shall I inform the sultana and the Syndicate?
I will speak with Her Grace myself.
Very good, sir.
The Elder Seedseer will have my reply anon.
My thanks to you, adventurer.
Ah, my lady envoy. I trust your stay in the sultanate has been pleasant. Now, if you do not mind my asking, do you perchance have plans to visit Limsa Lominsa in the near future? If so, I have information that may be of interest to you.
I once accompanied the Flame General on an official visit to the seaside city-state, during which time I became acquainted with Baderon, the proprietor of the Drowning Wench. Well, the man sent word just now that he has a job for a capable adventurer.
I can think of none with better credentials than you. Baderon would doubtless be pleased were you to offer him your services.
Welcome to the Drownin' Wench! Sit wherever ye like, lass. I'll be with ye in a─
Hm? Aye, I'm Baderon, all right. Who's askin'?
Ah, 'eard as I've got a job fer a capable 'venturer, ye say? Well, yer bloody right!
Just so yer fairly warned, though, this ain't no job fer the faint of 'eart. Things're liable to get downright bleedin' 'airy. But if ye think yer still interested, let me know, an' I'll fill ye in on the details.
