No...
No, no... We were promised an escape... Not the same doom we fled...
Noooooooooo!
I shall not meet my final days here in this blasted waste.
Calm yourselves! Your panic is our greatest enemy.
Come, we must build a line of defense.
How...?
Leave the fighting to us, Father. You must lead the people to safety!
I can handle this pair. You...
Shall tend to the refugees. Let us be about it!
As you wish, my little lord!
I'll command the beasts' attention. See to the wounded!
