Ahhh, the rage... It rises... Rises...
Stop!
Calm yourself. Please...
We die in pain. We die in suffering! Who are you to live? Who are you to hope!?
Hold on, my friends!
Urianger, watch out!
Alphinaud!
We cannot comprehend. We cannot know. We cannot know!
Don't, please! Don't do this to them. To yourself!
Just one good strike.
What?
Stop. Please, stop!
We will not suffer alone...
All will know our pain!
No you don't!
All awash in ice. A frozen waste. Forever silent!
Wait!
Don't!
You gifted them escape.
And rendered yourself powerless.
Bereft of the synergy you claim is your strength. Unless you mean to call upon the dead once more.
Defiant to the last. But you will be one with us ere long.
You will be battered and torn and made to crawl. You will weep and wail and curse your impotence. Curse your life as it fades.
As we did! As we died!
Such pain and sorrow we felt... Such anguish and rage... We tried. We tried. But it was no use...
Only when we surrendered did we find release. Only when we embraced death.
So join us in despair...and embrace yours!
My Ultimatum... What is happening...?
At the end of everything I find you, my friend.
I sought something in you, once. As you did in me.
When at last I understood what it was, I journeyed to Sharlayan to seek you out. Struck a bargain with the woman who shares your gift.
In exchange for lending the Scions my aid, I was given the means to come hither.
Gorging upon what remained of the Mothercrystal, I reclaimed the form of the dragon. And hungry still for our reunion, I rode the light of the stars to you.
I take it this is your prey.
But why does it still live? Surely it is no match for you.
I had assumed you would be above something so banal as despair. Am I mistaken?
And I'd rather not give it. Nay, I would have preferred that we enjoy a private reunion.
I care not. What I desire of you isn't succor. It is satisfaction.
So come, let us dispense with this distraction, you and I!
You struggle in vain. You will not silence our song of oblivion!
You will never reach it. Will never reach the deliverance you seek.
Our hunt ends this day. There is nowhere you can flee that we cannot follow.
Even stars must die.
Even stars must die.
Utterly futile.
Your suffering is at an end.
This is a kindness.
All of us have known despair.
We have seen the end.
The same end, again and again.
A sorrow so deep only emptiness remains.
'Tis so lonely between the stars.
If there is no happiness in life...
There is only one place it may be found.
Oblivion!
Oblivion!
Oblivion!
Dynamis?
No matter. You only delay the inevitable.
This is fate!
This is fate!
Your time has come. It always does...
Your time has come. It always does...
Your time has come. It always does...
