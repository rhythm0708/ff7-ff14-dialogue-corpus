The Mamool Ja have finally found peace in Tuliyollal. A pity those fanatics are intent on keeping that “tradition” alive...
The chosen of Mamook, Bakool Ja Ja. Winner of the recent martial tournament, and the only claimant not of the Dawn's Promise.
His strength is undeniable, but...you see how he is. A few devoted Mamool Ja are his only supporters.
What would he do with the throne should he win it?
His policies and so forth? I doubt he's thought much beyond winning the contest itself.
But one thing seems certain: if he does become Dawnservant, he will see the Mamool Ja exalted as the ruling class, and all others forced into subservience.
Sounds like another that “cannot be allowed to rule.”
