Eh? Ye don't look like one of them church fellas. Not that I'll turn ye away, no sir.
As ye can see, we've got a pile of unidentified bodies over yonder. No one's come to claim 'em, so off to the lichyard they go.
Be thankful ye didn't have to go inside and see the carnage for yerself. 'Twas the stuff of nightmares, I tell ye. Godsdamned imperials.
I don't know what quarrel they had with these folks, and I sure as hells don't want to know. The sooner we put this behind us, the better.
Say...ain't I seen you 'round here afore? Or do ye just have one of them faces? Ah, never mind...
Anyroad, there's a carriage come to haul the bodies to the lichyard, out by the east gate.
There's only eight left to load up, but seein' as I'm exhausted from carryin' all the others, I've a mind to leave the remainder to you.
Might want to cover yer nose while ye work. Some of these folk're startin' to turn...
