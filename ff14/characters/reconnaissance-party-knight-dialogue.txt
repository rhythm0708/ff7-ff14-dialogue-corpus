Thank...thank the Fury... I thought no one would come...
Three heretics slain and one knight saved, just like that. You certainly live up to your reputation, Mistress Surname.
What happened here, ser? Is there no one else?
We were caught in a furious blizzard north of here, my lord. <cough> <wheeze> Naught but white all around...until we saw shapes moving towards us─running towards us, with naked steel in their hands.
I cut down a few of the bastards who came close, but the others... There was shouting and screaming, but after a while I could only hear unfamiliar voices... I found my way to the camp, hoping to hide while the storm passed.
But the heretics tracked you here.
Aye... <cough> <cough> ...My lord, the heretics' hideaway lies somewhere to the north. We must move quickly, before the snow buries all traces of their passing. For my brothers, we...we must... <cough> <wheeze>
Have faith, ser. Justice will be done. But first, we must see you to safety.
He has the right of it, Mistress Surname. Whatever remains of the heretics' trail will be gone with the next snowfall. But we cannot very well leave our friend here...
I will see him to Falcon's Nest and gather reinforcements. In the meantime, I would have you search the area to the north of the camp for signs of the attack. Should you pick up the heretics' trail, do not wait for me─follow it back to their lair forthwith, being sure to leave me some clear footprints.
...I realize that this plan may place you in considerable danger, but I see no alternative.
Rest assured we will not be far behind. And Forename...thank you.
