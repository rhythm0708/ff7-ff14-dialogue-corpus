There's been an incident inside Copperbell Mines. We are here to ensure that its effects are contained, but for your own safety, I suggest you stay well away from here.
What? You're the adventurer who's volunteered to quell the hecatoncheires?
I didn't think that Papashan would be able to find someone so quickly...if at all.
The giants are content to wreak havoc inside the mines for now, but it's only a matter of time before they think to come outside. The sooner you see to them, the better. Make ready as best you can, and enter at will.
Good luck in there, adventurer. We Stone Torches will continue our vigil here, lest the foe slip by you.
