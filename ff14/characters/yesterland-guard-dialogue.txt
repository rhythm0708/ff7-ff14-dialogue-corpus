I bid you welcome to Yesterland, where the dreams of children and inner children alike come true! Please enjoy your stay!
Amazing... Is this also a recreation of an actual place?
After a fashion. Yesterland is themed upon a period of peace, before the Storm Surge had engulfed the world in conflict.
It was a golden age for Alexandria, and they've captured it here in the form of an amusement park.
Well now, another large-scale attraction!
Haha, I'm not ashamed to admit I'm excited as well, and I imagine this is how we're intended to feel.
So it goes with such places. But at the very least, it doesn't appear overly crowded.
It does, doesn't it? It's exciting to simply step through the entrance, and I imagine this is how we're intended to feel.
You mean you've visited the pixies' Garden of Dreams!? Thank goodness you are still with us...
'Tis all too easy to lose oneself in such a wondrous place. By the time you think to leave, dozens of years may have already passed.
And perhaps the very same could be said of this place...
On the far side of Yesterland is a castle. That's where the terminal is located, in the basement.
I'll go on ahead and wait for you there. Take what time you need to get acquainted with the locals.
Have fun, now!
Like before, we'll speak with the Endless. We'll learn what's dear to them before doing what we must.
Right, let's start by exploring and get our bearings!
