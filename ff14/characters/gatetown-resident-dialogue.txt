Thank goodness.
Over here!
“Meol” is a foodstuff which Eulmore routinely doles out to the people of Gatetown, and apparently a staple for its citizens as well.
Many here rely on it to survive in these times of scarcity. Yet the whole arrangement just seems...
Well, let us just say it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Now you understand why my attempts to enter the city have thus far come to naught. The dubious privilege of residency must be won via a contest with ever-changing rules...
They say this policy has been in place for the past two decades, ever since Eulmore's current ruler came into power.
Yet from what I have seen, it does more harm than good. Not only does it distract people from our shared struggle against the sin eaters, it robs them of their self-sufficiency. I have tried to propose ways they could improve their lot, but my words invariably fall on deaf ears.
The attitude is so entrenched now, I worry that─ Well, mayhap you should take a turn around Gatetown, and judge the situation for yourself.
Still here, are you? Can't blame you for wanting a slice of Eulmore's pie. If you ask me, you should ditch that sour-faced brat and make a home for yourself here!
Gatetown's not much to look at, aye, but at least it's safe. And the meol is the best thing I've ever tasted!
