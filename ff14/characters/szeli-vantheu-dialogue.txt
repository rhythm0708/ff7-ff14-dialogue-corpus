Ah, the last amaro! My thanks, friend. You may leave the beast with me.
Say, I don't believe I know you. Did you join the guard recently?
Hah, so that is the way of it! Well, you managed to arrive, and that's all that matters in the end.
I bid you welcome to the Ostall Imperative, one of our key strongholds in Lakeland.
The first thing you'll want to do is report to the captain. You'll find her at the lookout across the way.
So, it seems that rather than the amaro delivering you, you delivered the amaro.
I'll not thank youâ”€I expect all my soldiers to make themselves useful. Speaking of which, I have a task for you.
In readiness for the operation, the amaro will need to be treated with the same serum as us.
As you well know, however, it is not pleasant. In order to coax them into taking it, we have sprinkled it on their fodder.
All that remains is to feed it to them. A task I am sure you will enjoy. Fetch the fodder from the amaro launch and see to four of the beasts. Dismissed.
