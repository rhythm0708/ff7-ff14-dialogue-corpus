You the lass responsible for that commotion upstairs? Aye, word travels fast in Whitebrim Front. I gather you still wish to change Lord Drillemont's mind?
If there's one thing I've learned about the man in my time here, it's that he listens to and respects the opinions of those under his command. Win over the barracks, and he's sure to take notice. How, you ask? That's easy─serve the poor souls decent fare for a change.
The last few supply shipments contained no meat whatsoever, and the knights are rightfully beginning to complain. I'm thinking we could prepare them steaks using mudpuppy tail meat. 'Twouldn't be a quality meal, 'tis true, but it'd be a damn sight better than nothing.
If you've a mind to lend a hand, why not await a lurking mudpuppy in Daniffen Pass? And take this bottle of vinegar; locals say it weakens mudpuppies by clogging their mucous glands, drying their skin.
It didn't work, did it? Aye, I thought it was an idiotic idea...
Oh dear...remind me to never wander near mudpuppy spawning grounds without a bottle of vinegar. Anyroad, this should only take a moment. I'll just need to do this...and this...and voilà! Never seen a man cook steaks that fast, have you? Take these three and distribute them to the hungry knights here and up above.
