Teteroon? Aye, I seen him. That is to say, I saw him.
He was headed somewhere up north, by way of the ferry to Aleport. Might as well head there and see what ye can suss out. The skipper here can take you there.
When ye arrive, I'd start by askin' Ahldfoet. He's an old hand what knows a great deal about a great many things.
