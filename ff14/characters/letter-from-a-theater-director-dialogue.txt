I used to be an adventurer, but in the course of my travels, I developed the urge to recreate for others the sense of marvel that I was experiencing. One thing led to another, and I eventually became a theater director.
My role is to produce spectacular theater, and nothing is more gratifying than to receive praise from the audience.
For a long time to come, I hope to continue creating memorable adventures to share with everyone.Yours in imagination and wonderment,A Humble Theater Director
