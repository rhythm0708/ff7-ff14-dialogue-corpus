A Tuliyollan? ...No, you are from farther away than that, I think.
As for the High Luminary, I can only guess where he might be. He is warder of the Skyruin, but also keeper of the sepulchres, and his duties often take him outside the village.
As we receive few visitors, it is not often that I speak Turali. I am glad for the chance to keep in practice.
