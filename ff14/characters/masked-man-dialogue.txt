We have it, my lord! Turned it up among his retainer's possessions!
At long last, Gylbarde's journal...and not a moment too soon. I'd just about outstayed my welcome at the garrison.
When that adventurer caught us falling upon the patrol, I had feared that the game was up.
But thankfully, the other two were blind fools. All this time watching me, and they didn't see a thing. Hehehe...
We've only skimmed the tome, but it seems you were right. About what happened to Lord Vainchelon.
Was there ever any doubt? Once we return to Gridania and make this knowledge public, none shall harbor so much as a shred of sympathy for Ala Mhigo.
That shall pave the way for us to propagate Lord Vainchelon's will...and advance our agenda.
At last we've uncovered Nourval's purpose, and the tome is right before our eyes, no less.
Commander Heuloix spoke of a faction that vehemently opposes our aiding Ala Mhigo. I daresay we have found them.
But how did Nourval come to lead such a crew? And what is this talk of Vainchelon?
What, the Gridanian general sung about in nigh a hundred songs, who led our forces against Gylbarde in the Autumn War?
Only to die of an illness before the fighting was over. Aye, the very same. Having lost his leadership, we would have lost the war entirely had the other nations not come to our aid.
Don't know about the rest of you, but it seems to me our damning little secret pertains to Vainchelon.
And Nourval seeks to use it to stoke the fires of anti-Ala Mhigan sentiment to some sinister end. This cannot be borneâ”€we cannot let them have the journal! Are you with me?
Nourval! We cannot allow you to have that tome!
