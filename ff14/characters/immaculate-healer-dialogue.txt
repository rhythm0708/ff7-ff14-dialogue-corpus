Hrrrgh!
Ugh... <groan>
Hurrr... Urrrgh!
It worked! It really worked! I can't believe it...
Huh!? Are they...defending her? Dammit!We'll have to deal with them first!
This will work, I know it!
Godsdamn you, Lanbyrd! I'm sorry you're dead but you don't have to be such a bloody arse about it!
Hrugh!
Leave me alone, Lanbyrd!
Something's not right...
Keep your distance!
What did I do to deserve such attention?
Just die already!
Hragh!
Graaagh!
Huh!?
What!?
Ugh...
Guh...
Ahh...
That's it! Only two more to go!
I'll draw off Andreia! You handle the knight!
Your fight is with me, Andreia!
Stay away from the knight!
Hraaagh!
Get behind the knight!
Hrah!
Gah! That bloody knight is in the way. Dispatch him first!
Bracing!
Graaah!
Now, Forename! Now's our chance!
Oh no you don't!
You all right?
Heads up! Arrows incoming!
Graaagh!
Heads up!
Gah...
It's just us and Andreia now! It's time for Reeq and Forename to write a new legend for the ages!
Yes, yes!
Forename, to me!
Over here!
I...I really thought I...
Dammit...
Rest in peace, Renda-Rae...
We...we won... Even seeing it and saying it, it hardly feels real...
Huh? What's that you've got there?
Wicked white, you're...
You're Renda-Rae. The real Renda-Rae...
