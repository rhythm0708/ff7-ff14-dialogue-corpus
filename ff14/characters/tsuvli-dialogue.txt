Gobli might be a deft hand at distilling, but he's got no sense when it comes to appearances.
Rumor has it he's been invited to the palace for business negotiations. If he presents himself to the court wearing his usual rumpled attire, though, he'll be laughed out of Sunperch.
Most Pelupelu have at least one set of especially fine garments. The success of a deal can hinge on how you present yourself, so it pays to dress to impress.
So, what did you find out?
Oh, we can make use of all of those tidbits! The deal is as good as sealed!
As for me, I found out where Gobli is workingâ”€there's a millstone at the top of the slope behind the distillery. You go on ahead and I'll bring Wuk Lamat!
