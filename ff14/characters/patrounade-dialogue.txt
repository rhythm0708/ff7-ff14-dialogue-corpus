Ugh... Everything hurts. I think I was struck by debris from the tower...
Wait, I know you! Forename Surname! Ward of House Fortemps!
We fought together on the Steps of Faith. You saved my life back then...and now...
I can walk. Thank you. A thousand times, thank you...
Conrad! Conrad, can you hear me!?Naago, put him down over there!
Conrad! Conrad! Speak to me!
It...it was all so sudden. Conrad had just convinced the last few Skulls to surrender, when...when we heard the bang, and...and everything started to shake...
We carried the survivors to safety, but Conrad is... We have done what we can for him. All that remains is to pray.
Ugh...
Conrad!?
Is...is that you, Lyse? Can't...can't see a damn thing...
Well, that's that, then. Time's up.
What are you talking about!? You'll be on your feet before you know it!
It's all right, Lyse. I've lived long enough. But listen... I want...I want you to lead the Resistance in my stead.
Don't say another word! You'll recover─we'll recover! We'll bring freedom to Ala Mhigo together! We're not going to stop here!
No...no, you won't. Everything we've built, everyone we've brought together...I know you'll show them the way...
You've got it in you, Lyse. Not because you're Curtis's daughter, or Yda's sister, but because...because you're you. Because you're you...
Conrad...
Lead them to victory. To freedom.
I will, Conrad. I will. I promise.
I will, Conrad. I will. I promise.
Next round! Double the charge!
Come, Nidhogg. We are needed.
That's the ceruleum pipeline!
Impossible! How can one man─ Shoot the bastard! Shoot him!
Heh. My lance has slain far greater beasts.
...You're welcome, boy.
Notify all units─I want that intruder found!And get the engineers to fix my bloody cannon!
The savages are coming!
We could have killed them. We could have walked away...
But instead we tried to convince them to lay down their arms. We tried to seek a peaceful resolution.
We showed them mercy, and this was their response. Fire and blood! This was their answer!
Such crimes cannot go unpunished. They must not! Gods as my witness, there will be a reckoning!
...Forgive me. Now is not the time for vows of vengeance. We must remain calm and rational and in control.
The imperials have demonstrated a willingness to fire on their own. So long as we remain here, we are in danger.
We three will see to Commander Kemp's body. Find my sister and return to Ala Ghiri.
There, that should suffice for now. Go on and join the others.
...Tell me you've found Alphinaud. Tell me he is all right.
Oh, thank the Twelve! I don't know what I would have done... Though, saying that, what will the Resistance do without Commander Kemp?
Sorry─not here, not now. We should return to Ala Ghiri. Keep an eye out for any wounded who need our help on the way.
