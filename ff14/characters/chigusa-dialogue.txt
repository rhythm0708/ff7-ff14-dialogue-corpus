I stand corrected! Such a warm and cordial nature you possess. I pray you forgive me my earlier rudeness.
It has been some time since the viceroy came to our village to purge it of insurgents. Those who resisted suffered terribly, and those who did not fared little better.
We who remain know better than to risk her ire. If the imperials demand laborers, we comply. If they demand conscripts to send as soldiers to other provinces, we obey.
Ours is a difficult life, with little in the way of luxuries. I know not what you sell, merchant, but I doubt that I─nor anyone else here─can afford it.
