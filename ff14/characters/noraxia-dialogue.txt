Walking ones, please help this one! This one needs help! Needs help to help elder one! Poor Frixio! Poor, poor Frixiooo!!!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hooold your chocobos. Take a deep breath and tell us what's wrong, nice and slow.
Elder one went into Toto-Rak, but has not returned! This one is worried, so very worried!
And you're right to be... The place fair crawls with nasties waiting to make a meal of anyone daft enough to wander in.
What in the seven hells was he thinking, entering that bloody death trap?
Elder one had no choice! Imperial ones were chasing elder one! Please! Walking ones must help elder one─help elder one now!
Argh! The fates conspire against us... Forgive my pragmatism, but Frixio is our best hope of reaching an accord with the sylphs. Were we to lose him, all our efforts thus far will have been for naught.
I will tend to her wounds. Yda, make haste to the Adders' Nest and request assistance.
Understood!
Forename─go to the Thousand Maws of Toto-Rak and see that Frixio comes to no harm. Peace between man and sylph rests upon your success.
