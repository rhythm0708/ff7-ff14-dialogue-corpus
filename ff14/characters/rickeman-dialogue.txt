Eh? Someone tamperin' with shipments? Fury strike me down, if all them rosaries found in our people's possessions were planted... Hey now, don't you give me that look, lass! I'm a House Haillenarte man through an' through. This heresy nonsense is bad for me an' my family too!
I ain't sayin' the porters what were bringin' the shipment did it, though. I know most of them what work the trade routes, an' I've never had cause to question their faith. But if it wasn't them neither, then your guess is as good as mine. After all, most every shipment is thoroughly inspected before itâ”€
Eh? Could it've been the fellas what were responsible for the inspections? Hah! Ishgardian knights and inquisitors, the lot of them. As if they'd ever turn their cloaks. <sigh> Reckon that means the porters are your most likely suspects.
Hate to think it, but maybe you should question them. There's a crew comin' to Camp Dragonhead from Whitebrim Front this eve. You might consider havin' a word with them.
