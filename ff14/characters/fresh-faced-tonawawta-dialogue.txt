You're looking for a Mamool Ja woman?
Oh, Gulool Ja's mother... I can't help you there, I'm afraid.
I only know a little about Zoraal Ja, and then only what my father told me.
He said that before the dome cut us off from the outside world, a tural vidraal had appeared and was terrorizing the region.
In response, Zoraal Ja assembled a party of warriors, and with them confronted and felled the beast. It was interesting to hear of the king's feat in the past.

What a battle it must've been, between the king's men and the tural vidraal. And all without regulators, too...
