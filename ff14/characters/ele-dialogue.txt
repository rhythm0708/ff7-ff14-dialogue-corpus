<sniffle> Have... Have you seen my parents?
They told me to stay here with the others.  They said they'd be back soon, but it's been days...
They left with the man from Ul'dah. The man said they were gonna change everything─make it so we could live inside the walls with everyone else. I liked it when he said that.
I didn't like it when he talked about making the rich people pay. Everyone looked so angry, and I got scared...
Say, miss...are you looking for someone?
You mean...the man who left with my parents? But I don't know where he─
Wait...look! Over there! I think that's him!
