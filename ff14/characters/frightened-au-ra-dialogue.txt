Have you...have you come to...help us?
Too late...too late... My family...my friends... <sob>
I...I am fine, thank you... Please...save the others...
Are these the only villagers who survived?
I can only hope others managed to flee. But if the rest have been turned to beasts... By the Twelve...
Let us do what we can to see that the damage spreads no further. And no matter what comes, we must keep our spirits high...lest we ourselves suffer a similar fate.
I can tend to the rest. Pray look after Matsya─no doubt what we have seen here weighs even heavier on his heart than ours.
Stay by Matsya's side, Forename. Unlike us, he is not accustomed to seeing such horrors...
Oh, Forename! Forename!
This is Yeruvvet, the elder here. He is hurt, but─praise be to the Sisters─he still lives!
