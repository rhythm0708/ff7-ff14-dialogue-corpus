As someone who composes music for the stage, nothing pleases me more than to hear that you are moved by my work.
I am also humbled to receive your words of appreciation for the concerts we hold and the orchestrion rolls we release.
You are my motivation, spurring me to continue composing music that brings the story to life, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.Yours in the melody,A Humble Theater Composer
