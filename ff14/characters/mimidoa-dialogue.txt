'Nother 'nitiate, are ye? No? Then what are ye? Speak up, missy, I can't hear ye!
Eh!? Bugger me, is this what I think it is? Nah, couldn't be... Ye found this, ye say? Where'd ye say ye found it?
Skyfryn, ye say? Was hopin' to have a word with the lad, but it sounds like there's naught left 'twixt his ears. He was s'posed to help patch up Pharos Sirius, he was. Company sent me to supervise the lot of 'em.
Weren't gettin' work done on their own, see─half of 'em walked off, half of 'em ran off, an' half of 'em up an' vanished.
What's that? Ye be lookin' fer passage to the Isles of Umbra!? Why didn't ye say so─I've been thinkin' o' dispatchin' someone to take a look on behalf of ol' Mimidoa. Tell him how the land lies.
Ain't nobody been interested till you came a-callin'. Whole port's up in arms 'bout spirits an' so forth. If I had the gil, I'd hire some sellswords an' let 'em sort it out...
But ye'll do in a pinch, ye will. Show this parchment to the skipper an' he'll see ye there an' back.
So you went and had a word with Mimidoa. I hope the valuable time you saw fit to waste amounted to something.
You mean that disgusting creature was Skyfryn's superior? I find that hard to believe. But this writ of passage does appear to be genuine, so it must be true...
I must say, it is a relief to work with such an industrious woman as you. I look forward to hearing of the discoveries you will make on the Isles of Umbra...without me.
<sigh> Fine, fine! I fail to see the justification for dragging me along on your journey, but if you insist, I will go as well.
But Twelve as my witness, if you leave me behind to be devoured by some horrid abomination, I...I shall come back to haunt you!
