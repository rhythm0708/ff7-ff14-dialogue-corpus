Take heart, tiller of the soil. The Resilient Son, blood heir to the Dawnservant, has heard your pleas.
Zoraal Ja. The First Promise and commander of the Landsguard.
Sareel Ja, the palace seer. As he was so careful to remind the crowd, Zoraal Ja is indeed the natural child of Gulool Ja Ja.
And “Resilient Son”? Is that another title, like the First Promise?
After a fashion. Common knowledge has it that two-headed Mamool Ja cannot sire children...
Yet Zoraal Ja was born all the same, with the Head of Resolve's features and the Head of Reason's scales─an extraordinary example of life's unyielding resilience.
And a warrior's reticence. He says little, but the way he moves... I know a hardened soldier when I see one.
He's a natural swordsman─a gift he inherited from his father. Some even say that the son has already surpassed the sire.
Should he come to power, the First Promise means to employ that martial prowess in the conquest of foreign lands. For this, he and his supporters have been labeled expansionists.
This puts him in direct opposition to Wuk Lamat, who advocates for the preservation of peace.
You may recall that she spoke of a claimant who “cannot be allowed to rule.” That is Zoraal Ja─the warmonger.
Krile? Are you all right?
The Echo... It gave me a glimpse into Zoraal Ja's ambitions.
Deep and unknowable, like an abyss, yet at the same time a roaring, unquenchable fire...
It was a trifle terrifying, to be frank.
