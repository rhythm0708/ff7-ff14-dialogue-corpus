Oh, hello there! I'm Yozan, son of Hozan. Will you be coming with us to Ul'dah? I hear we're traveling by horsebird-drawn carriage!
But...don't you think they're queer? Giant birds that people ride like horses? I still want to try riding one, butâ”€
What's that? You're looking for the others? Don't worry. I already told them to get ready for the carriages.
I'll need your help, though. We were just finishing a game of hide-and-seek. Three players are still in hiding, and since Lady Yugiri told us to take it really seriously, they won't move until they're found. But Vesper Bay isn't that big, so I bet you can find them in no time!
