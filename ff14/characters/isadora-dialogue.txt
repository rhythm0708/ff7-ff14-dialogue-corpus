Your Majesty! You came!
I have friends with me today. Is that all right?
Of course! Friends of the queen are friends of ours. Please, make yourselves at home.
How has Milos been?
There's been no change, but the symptoms are thankfully mild today.
Hello, Milos. Have you missed me?
My son was born with levin sickness─a severe aetheric imbalance towards lightning.
As a result, he suffers from paralysis. He cannot walk and struggles to speak.
For a blessing, he still has his hearing, and even on bad days he can communicate with his eyes.
I see... Sphene visits often, does she?
She does. Milos simply adores her. He sometimes even manages a smile when she's here.
What of yourself, Isadora? How are you holding up?
You needn't worry about me, Your Majesty. You always make time for us, and we have everything we need.
I'm glad to hear that. But you mustn't strain yourself, understood?
There is nothing you can do for him? Perhaps a treatment with souls or...
Unfortunately no. While souls can revive those who have met with an accident, they cannot reverse the effects of old age and illness.
Truth be told, many children are born like Milos. The illness has existed for generations, but we've been unable to find a cure.
The cause is quite clear, though─the excess lightning in the environment. It's no coincidence the number of cases has risen dramatically these past thirty years.
It's all my fault...
What was that?
I'm sorry, Isadora, but I must be going. I promise to make it a proper visit next time, with treats to share.
There's no need to apologize, Your Majesty. If it weren't for you, Milos and I wouldn't still be here.
