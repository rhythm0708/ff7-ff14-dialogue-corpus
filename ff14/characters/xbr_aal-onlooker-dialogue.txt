The elders, they complain and complain about “abandoning tradition,” but we're not like them, afraid of everything foreign and new!
You have our wholehearted support! With your ingenuity and knowledge, you're sure to win the contest!
Forgive me, but the rite of succession is barely begun. I will hear your petitions if and when I am named Dawnservant.
If you will excuse me.
Plainspoken, as always.
That's our Koana, practical to a fault.
Here we have Koana, the Second Promise, who spent time as a pupil at Sharlayan's own Studium.
Now that you mention it, I think I did see him in the halls once or twice. There was nothing to suggest he was Turali, much less from a royal family.
That was by design. He forewent his usual garb and took an Eorzean name to avoid attention.
So it was Koana who introduced the dirigibles. And the railway, too, given what we just heard...?
In furtherance of his goal: to enrich Tuliyollal with every bright notion he learned of in Sharlayan. He is the hope of those who prize innovation.
As aloof as he may seem, Koana and Wuk Lamat actually get along rather well. They bicker and banter as only close siblings do.
How gracious of you all to cheer the lesser claimants!
Oh come now, what are you afraid of? I'm no different from your Dawnservant.
That my kind should reign is Mamool Ja tradition─and has been so since before there was a Tuliyollal!
I'll brush aside your feeble contenders, and then you'll see who deserves your fealty!
Well said, Brother!
