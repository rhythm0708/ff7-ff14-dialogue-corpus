Hello there, I'm Mablu! Did you have a question for me?
...Sorry, I don't know about any “electors.” You should take a moment to see our prized alpacas before you leave, though!
Oh, but be sure to admire them from a respectable distance! Get too close, and our nervous darlings may be tempted to spit on you─and that stuff stinks!
It happened to a visiting buyer not so long ago. Tobli─that's the head rancher─was so mad at me for not giving a proper warning.
No one makes a mistake without Tobli noticing. He knows everything that happens on this ranch.
Well, it's back to work for me! I'll catch a scolding if Tobli finds me standing idle!
You really have to watch yourself around these silver-tongued peddlers. I almost bought a bottle of mezcal. And a stack of blankets. And then there was this enchanting ornament...
Anyway, I did manage to learn that Tobli is the man to talk to about the contest. Now if only they'd share where this “head ledger” of theirs is to be found.
Really!? He's also the head rancher?
Well, the alpaca ranch is not far from here. I say we pay it a visit before the others return.
Back already?
