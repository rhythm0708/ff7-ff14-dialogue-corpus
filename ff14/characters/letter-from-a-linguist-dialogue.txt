I first set foot in this land ten years ago. Since then, I have had occasion to meet numerous fine adventurers like yourself.
Many languages exist, and they sometimes act as a wall that divide us. This world, however, is a place where we might transcend that wall and come together in unity.
Each and every day, you and yours find various ways to forge bonds. In so doing, you gain access to a new world as seen through different eyesâ”€and that is what makes life endlessly fascinating.
As you carry on adventuring, I pray that you will be blessed with many such enriching encounters.Yours in understanding and unity,A Humble Linguist
