Yes? Is there something you require?
Lady Y'mhitra, it is an honor to meet you. My name is Alphinaud Leveilleur, and this is Tataru Taru.
So you are my sister's comrades in the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.
When I heard that your people were being pursued, I desperately sought to reach Shtola, but all mine efforts were to no avail. Now I know why. A forbidden spell, of all things! That she should be so reckless...
But what's done is done. I thank you for bringing word to me. Needless to say, I should be glad to help.
Though we were born of different mothers, our veins course with the same father's blood. I hope that this will be enough for the elementals. Come, let us make for Everschade at once.
Let us begin.
Raya-O, A-Ruhnâ”€if you would.
Hearken to me, O great ones. Pray give yourselves to the Lifestream, a drifting soul to find.
Please, Y'shtola... Please come back to us...
There!
Now!
A room has been readied at the Roost. Pray bear her thither at once.
All that remains is to pray, my friends.
<sniff> <sniff> Oh, Y'shtola...
Just seeing her face again... It's... <sniff> Oh, I've been so worried...
Y'shtola is resting within an inn room. Though she's still unconscious, the signs are positive.
The conjurers say she is in sound health and should awaken before long! Isn't that wonderful?
Now, while we wait for Y'shtola to wake up, I thought I'd take the opportunity to finish my little surprise for her.
It's something I've been working on for a while now, in the hope that she'd one day return to us. It wants for just a couple more items before it's ready.
I've already placed orders for these items. Could I ask you to retrieve them for me? One is with the Leatherworkers' Guild and another is with the Conjurers' Guild. Speak with Mistress Geva and Brother E-Sumi-Yan, and they ought to take care of you!
