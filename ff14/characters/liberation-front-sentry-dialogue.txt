Aye, the captain went outside some few bells agoâ”€and looking quite unwell, I am sorry to say. This I mentioned to Lord Gosetsu, who straightways struck out after him. I hope they will be all right...
Gosetsu too? It seems everyone is bent on joining the search.
That's all well and good, but someone has to stay behind. There's no telling what the Empire is plotting.
You go on, Forename. Alphinaud and I shall hold the fort.
