Well, I am. Fellow I know claims he came upon them near the Hawthorne Hut in the East Shroud. At first he thought they were men, but on closer inspection, he says they were more like dolls.
And you didn't think to share this little tidbit with me, Brother? If I were to fall victim to these abominations, I shall consider my death on your head.
I pray I do not run afoul of these mechanical monstrosities alone in the forest. The mere thought chills me to the spine...
As I said, the fellow I know claims he came upon the mechanical soldiers near the Hawthorne Hut in the East Shroud. At first he thought they were men, but on closer inspection, he says they were more like dolls.
Mechanical soldiers? As a matter of fact, one of our sentries at Amarissaix's Spire reported encountering them while patrolling the Bramble Patch.
At first he took them to be scarecrows, but as he approached them, they suddenly sprang to life and set upon him. We suspect that they are some heretofore unknown imperial weapon, and we are deliberating a response even as we speak.
If your path takes you near that area, you would do well to exercise all caution.
