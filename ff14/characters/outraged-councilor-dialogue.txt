Mind your tongue, Archon! If you had seen─!
Yes, we are bound by a duty we cannot ignore.
Knowing this, what would you have us do? Abandon our vital work, and join you on the field of battle?
We will never choose the way of the sword. We will fulfill our mission not through strife and bloodshed, but survival.
Come what may, we shall live on. We must.
Do as you must then. But we Scions will fight─until the heavens fall, until our last breath.
Such misguided zeal...
Father, I... Master Fourchenault.
I fail to understand the stance you have elected to take. But by the same token, I have yet to find a compelling argument to counter the challenge you put to us in Gridania.
Still, in the midst of my uncertainty...
I must trust in myself to do what is right. As others have chosen to trust in me.
So I will continue as I always have, weighing the consequences of my every action, and allowing my hope for the future to inform my decisions.
