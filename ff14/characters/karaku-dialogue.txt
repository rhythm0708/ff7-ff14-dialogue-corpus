Come one, come all! Burns, cuts, embarrassing rashes─there is naught that the mystical waters of the Bokaisen Hot Springs cannot heal!
Ho, what is that in your hand?
Hmm...you seek this Au Ra and this Roegadyn, do you?
A thousand apologies, but I cannot help you. It is against our policy to divulge information regarding patrons past or present.
Please! We came all the way from Eorzea to find our friends!
We have our reputation to consider, miss. Men and women from all walks of life come here in search of rejuvenation─body and soul.
They seek privacy and discretion, and we have ever honored their wishes. Only the Sekiseigumi may demand otherwise. I am sorry, but there is naught I can do.
I suppose we'll just have to ask someone else, then. What about that woman who runs the hostelry? Kotokaze, was it?
