Those kobolds certainly know how to handle themselves!
The Amalj'aa will not soon forget this day...
Our allies have steered well clear of the tower, for good reason.
Children of man... The shade of my beloved is no more, and I...I shall be forever in your debt.
By your deeds are we set free. And free we shall remain, as long as I draw breath. Never again shall the dragons of Meracydia hearken to the lies of the Ascians. This I vow.
