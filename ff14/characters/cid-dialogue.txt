I am Marques, yes. A body? Of course... There...there have been...so many bodies of late...
I... I apologize, miss. If you seek a place of burial, then there is an empty grave atop the ridge. Take the path and lay him to rest there.
May they all walk in Thal's realm... ...What? Missing people? I...I'm afraid I cannot help you.
But maybe Sister Ourcen can. She has been kind to me. Everyone...everyone has been so kind.
I don't know why, though. I... Pardon me. You will find Sister Ourcen within the church walls.
