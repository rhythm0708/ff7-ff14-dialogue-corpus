When summer arrives and brings the scorching rays of the sun with it, there's no better place to be than Costa del Sol. That would be true even if the Moonfire Faire weren't underway, so you're doubly lucky to be here! If you have any questions about this singular event, please ask away!
Several years ago, the Adventurers' Guild formed the Cascadiers to combat an invasion of rampaging Bombards. The Moonfire Faire was first held to attract new members to the cause.
It proved so popular that it has been held annually ever since, whether the Bombards appear or not. It helps spread word of the guild's activities and generate interest among potential new recruits. In charge of the proceedings is the grand chaperone, Haermaga.
He has decided to have members of the Adventurers' Guild demonstrate their courage and physical prowess to faire-goers through a series of challenges in Costa del Sol.
Master Gegeruju has once again provided the space and funding for the event. It's sure to be the most spectacular Moonfire Faire held to date!
Since you're here, why not join in the festivities?
The Eorzean Nimble Warrior course offers adventurers unparalleled challenge and excitement!
Never content to rest on their laurels, the guild has prepared new routes that will challenge the nimblest of contenders. Yes, this crucible promises to forge memories whose luster will never fade!
Why not have a crack at it and make some memories of your own? You have my word that even seasoned adventurers will find plenty to be thrilled about!
