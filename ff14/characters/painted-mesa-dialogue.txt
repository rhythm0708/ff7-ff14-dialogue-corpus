Lookin' for Painted Mesa? You found him.
So you're the adventurer who's volunteered to deal with the mess down in Copperbell, are you?
You've got guts, miss. I just hope you've got skills to go with 'em, 'cause things ain't pretty down there. The hecatoncheires've left the place in a right state, and nary a week after minin' resumed.
I don't know if you know this, but Copperbell was old when the second Ul Dynasty was still young, and it was abandoned centuries ago. If it hadn't been for the shortage of materials needed for the rebuildin' effort, the Concern would never have thought to reopen it.
We knew full well about the giants beforehand, but the project went ahead anyway. I mean, nothin' could possibly survive bein' buried under a mountain's worth of rock for three centuries, right? Wrong!
Our miners dug up more than they bargained for. One swing of the pickaxe too many, and they found 'emselves in the company of giants. Unless we can subdue 'em, the nation's glorious recovery'll grind to a halt for want of aught to build with.
The Stone Torches're keepin' watch over the entrance in case the giants fancy some sunlight and fresh air. One of 'em will be able to show you the way in. The hope of the nation's restin' on you, friend. Best of luck!
The hope of the nation's restin' on your shoulders, friend. Send them giants back to whichever of the seven hells they escaped from!
