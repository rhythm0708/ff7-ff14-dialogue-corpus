So you are the Emissary-to-be. Miounne sent word that you would be coming to collect the ceremonial artifact.
The good news is that it's ready─painstakingly crafted by these very hands, and from the rarest of materials.
Take it, along with this warning: get so much as a scratch on the thing, and I shall make an unceremonial artifact out of you.
Back from your trip to the Carpenters' Guild? Let's see what you have in that box.
Ahhh...this is by far the finest Monoa mask I have ever laid eyes upon. The timbermaster has truly outdone himself this time.
In case he didn't mention, the mask is crafted from consecrated lumber rendered up by the Guardian Tree, solely for use in the ceremony. In other words, it is priceless─Mother bids you to handle it with care.
And with that, your preparations are complete. The venue should just about be in order as well. If you have any questions, now's the time to ask them.
Now that you have the Monoa mask, all that's left is to participate in the ceremony.
Perchance you are feeling nervous, but never fear─despite all the pomp surrounding the role, there really is nothing to being Emissary.
All you are required to do is wear the mask, stand up straight, and look dignified. The more involved aspects of the proceedings will be handled by others. Simple, no?
The ceremony will be held at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre. When you are ready, make yourself known to the caretaker there─a woman named Estaine.
Oh, and be sure to wear your mask or she may not recognize you. Now, off you go, Forename, and good luck!
