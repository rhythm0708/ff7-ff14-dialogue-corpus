Well, well, who should it be but young Varshahn. On an errand for the satrap?
I am. His Excellency bade me come to collect your report.
He also wished to express his heartfelt gratitude to the brave men and women of the Radiant Host for their unflagging dedication.
We simply do our duty, but we are honored to receive His Excellency's regard.
And yet, for his boundless benevolence, his treatment of one so young could be regarded as...callous.
Though we have enjoyed relative peace and calm these past few days, this remains the front line of battle. No place for children.
Your predecessor too often traveled alone. It's been, what, two years now since you took over? I wonder how the fellow is faring...
Like those before him, he went on to represent the satrap in foreign lands. Wherever he may now be, I am certain he is well.
As for myself, I assure you that all I do, I do of my own volition, and gladly. I pray you do not think ill of His Excellency.
Certainly not, lad... Whatever happens, my faith in the satrap is unwavering. But still I worry for you.
We would be overcome with sadness if something were to befall you, for you are as a little brother to us all. Take care, do you hear?
I will, Nahbdeen. Thank you.
And who might this be? Not Hannish by the look of her.
Permit me to introduce Forename Surname, of the Eorzean contingent, come to assist in the making of the talisman.
From Eorzea, you say! Towers have appeared over there too, yes? Tell me, what is the situation like?
May I suggest that you exchange information with our soldiers? Both parties would stand to learn something of value, I believe.
An excellent idea. Given the unprecedented nature of the threat, some of ours are understandably anxious. We would be glad for any tidings you can share.
You two, bring Varshahn the latest report, and answer any questions he may have.
All appears quiet with the tower at the moment. I daresay the soldiers won't mind if you approached them.
It occurs to me I have yet to properly introduce our company.
We are the Radiant Host, a military order under the satrap's command. Our duty is to preserve peace in the land, be it patrolling the streets or dealing with heretofore unknown threats such as now.
We train hard, and admit only capable warriors to our ranks. Even so, we've struggled to contend with the fiends from the tower.
Though we succeeded in striking them down on the two occasions they came in force, we had to pay a heavy price.
What of the towers in Eorzea? Do they likewise spawn monsters?
So it's much the same everywhere... With every nation struggling, we cannot expect calls for outside aid to be answered.
My thanks not only for the information, but for accompanying Varshahn besides. While he's wise beyond his years, he's still a child, and we couldn't bear to see him come to harm.
