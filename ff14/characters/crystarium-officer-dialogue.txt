Forward! Forward! If you can still hold a sword, follow me! Wounded, to the rear!
Weapons at the ready! Let's make this count!
Fight and struggle. Seek salvation by your own hands.
Though the losses be grave, endure them. Though the victories be hollow, claim them.
It seems we've driven them back─for the time being, at least.
The wounded have been collected and are undergoing treatment now. Once they're ready to be moved, we'll have them carried back to the Crystarium.
The dead as well, of course. Those whose bodies remain, anyway...
The others are helping to treat the wounded. I'm planning to assist in moving them, but even so, we simply don't have enough hands.
I'm sure you're fit to fall over after what we've been through─gods know I am─but if you could see to a few of the patients, it would be an enormous help.
Captain Lyna is about somewhere, so you might also consider asking her if there are any other outstanding areas of need. We'll talk later.
