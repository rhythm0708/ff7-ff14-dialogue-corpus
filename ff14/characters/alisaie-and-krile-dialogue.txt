...Sharlayan's foremost educational institute!
You always did enjoy giving the grand tour to new students!
Indeed, I've long since lost track of how many times he has recited that same foppish speech. Such is his undying love for his old stamping ground.
He was in top form back then. Youngest to enter the Studium, graduated with highest honors in magical arts and aetherology, undisputed champion of the debating chamber...
Hold on. You both joined the Studium at the same age, yes? And from where I stand, you're equally prodigious scholars.
Nice of you to say, but Alphinaud actually entered half a year before me. Nor did I do well enough to graduate with honors. And I am certainly not the Studium's most notorious master debater.
In all respects have I ever been in his shadow. If nothing else, just remember that this was where the legend of Alphinaud Leveilleur began.
We should expect everyone to be fully aware of our recent escapades. Hopefully, we'll be somewhat more welcome here than we were at the Last Stand.
I know better than anyone the adoration the student body has for Alphinaud, and with a bit of luck, it might work to our advantage.
Well, there's no time like the present.
First things first, let's look for Scholarch Montichaigne. Other faculty tend to frequent their offices, but unfortunately for us, he's fond of wandering wheresoever his whims take him...
Let's split up and ask the students if they've seen him!
