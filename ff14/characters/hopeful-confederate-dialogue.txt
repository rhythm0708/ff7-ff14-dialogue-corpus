The Confederacy! They've come to save us!
And this after I took such pains to cow them. Even pirates have their pride, I suppose. Enough to march to their deaths, no less. Oh, the stupidity of it all...

My lady, I... I'm going outside!
The kami are not finished with you yet...
There's no end to them! They just keep coming!
Then we must be doing something right. We have to hold out for as long as we can. She's counting on us!
