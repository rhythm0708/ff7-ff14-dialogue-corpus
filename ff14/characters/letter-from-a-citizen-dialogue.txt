Dear adventurer,During the Calamity and for a long time afterwards, there was nary a smile to be seen upon faces.
Now, however, I often see you and yours walking happily through the city, and it never fails to warm the heart. In my mind, you are the symbols of the new era.
No one can say what the future holds, but when I see your smiles, I am reassured that somehow all will be well.Sincerely yours,A Humble Citizen
