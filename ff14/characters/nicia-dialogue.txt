Greetings, adventurer. I see you are faithfully following Mother Miounne's instructions.
Allow me to offer you a bit of instruction myself. I am Nicia of the Wood Wailers, and I know a thing or two about the aetheryte─yes, that big crystal right there.
Aetherytes are devices that tap into aetherial energies, and are primarily used as a means to travel swiftly from one place to another.
Return and Teleport─the most common transportation spells─make direct use of the aetherytes and their connection to the flow of aether.
And as these devices are found in almost every corner of Eorzea, any adventurer worthy of the name will wish to seek out and attune herself to each one.
Truly, few things in this world are so useful to an intrepid explorer.
But you need not locate them all at once. Before rushing out into the wilds, I suggest you start with the aetherytes found here in Gridania.
Should you wish to learn more about the aetheryte or transportation magic, I am here to answer your questions.
