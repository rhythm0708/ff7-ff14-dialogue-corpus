What's all this commotion, then?
Mister Boulder and Mister Coultenet! Did you know that Miss Forename is back!?
So it would seem. Welcome home, Forename. My companion and I but recently became full members of the Scions, and I believe proper introductions have yet to be made.
I am known as Hoary Boulder, and this bookish fellow is Coultenet. Though we remain largely unproven as adventurers, we have taken it upon ourselves to instruct the Doman younglings in the arts of combat.
Ugh, I told you, Mister Boulder: we are not younglings anymoreâ”€we are adventurers!
And we were just asking Miss Forename if she could give us some special training. I think we're ready to hunt monsters alongside her, don't you?
Well, you've certainly been diligent with your drills...but I'm afraid the fiends of Mor Dhona are still ever so slightly too dangerous for you.
I have a counter-proposal: what if I were to cross swords with Forename? A demonstration of skill at arms, if you will.
