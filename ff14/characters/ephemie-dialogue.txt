Forename Surname!? Gods, I did not expect to meet you strolling about town! The tales of your primal battles were what inspired me to come to Revenant's Toll.
'Tis an honor to receive this uniform from your hands. I shall wear it with pride!
Yes, Forename? Ah, Tataru mentioned you were handing out the new uniforms. I assume you've now met the rest of the recruits?
Some few answered the call to arms I put forth through the established Grand Companies and such. We are not yet an army, but there is much a small corps of elite warriors can achieve.
...Did I mention I'd thought of a name for the company? 'Tis my hope that it shall soon be known across the breadth of Eorzea.
The moment of truth draws near, Forename. Once the last of the recruits have gathered, I shall make the official announcement.
Comrades! Your presence here this day signifies the momentous choice that each of you has made.
With your strength now pledged to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, you are beholden to no single nation. You stand as the vanguard for a united Eorzea!
From this moment forth, I declare you Crystal Braves! Let us mend this fractured realm, and face our enemies as one!
Whether it be the beastmen and their primals, or the conflict in Carteneau, it is plain that the nations of Eorzea cannot solve the problems which plague the realm. Thus does it fall to some few heroic souls to succeed where they have failed!
Come! Take your place at the Scions' side as guardians of Eorzea! And together we shall fight for the freedom of all!
