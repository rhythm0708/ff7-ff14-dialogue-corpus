Gods, it never ends, does it? <sigh> What can I do for you?
We've brought samples from Sharlayan Hamlet─series one-one-zero? The crates are by the entrance.
Ah, thank you. I had expected one of my colleagues, but we are dreadfully shorthanded...
Just a moment─you are Fourchenault's children, are you not?
Alphinaud and Alisaie, at your service. You're well acquainted with Father, I take it?
Quite! I've been friends with your parents since our days at the Studium. I remember when you were yea high, waddling hither and thither...
Clearly, it's been quite some time since we've met. 'Tis good to see you again─wielding your father's nouliths, no less!
You knew our parents when they were young? What were they like? Pray, spare no detail!
I should like nothing more than to regale you─alas, I am meant to be in charge here, and reams of paperwork want for submission.
We can help with that! In exchange for the sort of stories our parents would never willingly divulge, of course.
Er...very well, then. There happen to be three sets of documents in need of delivery, so how about you each take one?
Wait right there!
You will find a Forum representative waiting to collect these near the southernmost structure. I hope I haven't kept her waiting too long...
Never mind Alphinaud and Alisaie─I'm certain they will be back soon enough.
Who are you, by the by? The twins' minder?
