Ah! N-No one said you'd be coming! Could you give me a moment to clean up my station?
Ah! N-No one said you'd be coming! Er...how can I help you?
You wish to try my clothes? Really?
O-Of course! It would be my honor! Did you have anything in mind?
I-I think I can handle that. Let's see...
This should do!
Some of my best work yet.
It's a relatively new concept incorporating an idea that's never been tried with clothing before.
Fragrance! Can you smell the carrots? <sniff> <sniff> Ah, simply divine!
I was worried how the concept would turn out when put to the proof, but it looks stunning on you!
Won't you go and show Livingway? I'm sure she's eager to see what we've come up with.
Looking for a fresh set, are we? Here you go.
What happened to my concept? No matterâ”€I can fix this!
Oh? What happened to the change of wardrobe?
My, don't we look splendid!
The result of much trial and error, but I know quality work when I see it.
Shhh. You needn't speak. I can see your adoration for the moon and we Loporrits in your eyes. No doubt your friends feel the same having sampled our creations.
Sorry to have kept you waiting...
They insisted we sample all of their concepts ere we returned.
Verily, 'tis an ensemble most becoming.
