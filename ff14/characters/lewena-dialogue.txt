Excellent. The next show should be commencing any moment now...
Hm? Eavesdropping, are we? How very quaint. If you must know, I will soon be making for Blunderville, that I might spectate a few rounds of organized chaos. You have heard of it, yes? ...No?
It shouldn't come as any surprise, but the Gold Saucer has once again deigned to dream bigger. They now offer a host of precarious obstacle courses─which they refer to as “shows”─and lavish prizes to those who participate.
If you prefer something more thrilling than cards and Cactpots, perhaps you might find it to your liking. Speak with a curiously dressed man named Wy, and he shall guide you to Blunderville Square.
If you wish to gaze upon the Saucer's newest attraction for yourself, you need only speak with Wy at Wonder Square.
