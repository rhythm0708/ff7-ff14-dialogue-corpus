Lord Haurchefant! Chocobos are prohibited in the Supreme Sacred Tribunal of Halonic Inquisitory Doctrine! Your steed must remain outside!
Black chocobos are all well and good, but the true reward for your efforts is the exoneration of your comrades.
They shall be released upon the completion of certain minor formalities, which I mean to see to personally. In the meantime, pray return to Fortemps Manor. The count has done so already, and will doubtless be eager to discuss the day's events.
Halone smiles on us yet again, Mistress Surname, guiding you to victory and setting your comrades free.
I confess, I did fear for your safety. Which is not to say I doubted your prowess, you understand... I merely knew the strength of your opponents. Ahem. You do have a habit of exceeding my expectations.
Besting two of the Heavens' Ward while the city's elite looked on? By the Fury, anyone who hasn't been paying attention to you will surely do so from now on!
M-My lord!
We have just received a message from the Vault. His Eminence the archbishop requests the presence of Mistress Surname.
An invitation from the archbishop!?
What an honor...
A personal summons is indeed a great honor, and given recent events, you would be wise not to delay...
Go, Mistress Surname. We shall speak anon.
A priest will be waiting for you outside the Vault. Identify yourself to him and he will escort you inside.
