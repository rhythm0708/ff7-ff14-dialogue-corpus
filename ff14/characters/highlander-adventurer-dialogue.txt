Hm? Somethin' you need?
Oh, Nhagi. Aye, I know the sprightly lad. Couldn't say where he is now, but last I saw him, he mentioned takin' on some delivery work.
He's a curious one, he is. Gets along with everyone well enough, but doesn't seem to like workin' in a team. What with talk of bandits prowlin' the road of late, I can't help but worry.
As I said, I couldn't say where Nhagi is now, but he mentioned takin' on some delivery work. Might be as that's what he's out doin'.
