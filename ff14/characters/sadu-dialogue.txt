What is this? Who are these outsiders?
Sadu Khatun! Forgive me. We were returning from our hunt when we were caught unawares by manzasiri.
These ones saved me, but Geser is...
Who are you? Why have you come? Not to cross the sands, that much is certain.
I have heard tales of travelers in league with another tribe. Are you they? Who do you serve? Answer me.
If I may begin to answer your questions before you ask more...we are friends of the Mol, and we are come to see the strength of the Dotharl for ourselves.
The Mol? The little lambs who wander to and fro at the behest of their gods?
Bwahahaha! What fools you are to share the soil of such weaklings! Next you will tell me you wish to fight in the Naadam!
Ah...so you do. Hah! That is unexpected...yet not unwelcome.
I am Sadu. Khatun of the Dotharl.For your deeds, I grant you leave to walk among us. Come. Look on our glory and despair.
We fear no tribe─least of all the Mol. Though, if you were of the Oronir, I would burn the flesh from your bones here and now.
You can stand, yes? See to the corpse.
Y-Yes, Khatun!
So that is the leader of the Dotharl. Clearly not a woman to be crossed.
But how callously she spoke of her dead! “See to the corpse”? Surely this warrior deserves better than that...
Forgive me, Forename, but I cannot in good conscience ignore the callous disregard that woman showed for her kinsman!
We must seek her out at once! With me!
How he died matters not.Geser was a great warrior. He will return to us in time.
