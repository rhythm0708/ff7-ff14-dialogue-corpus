My thanks. I'll be fine now.
But we failed to protect the people...
Why did so many have to die? Where were Vow Wuk Lamat and Vow Koana!?
Ugh, they're not to blame. I understand, I do, but... <sigh> I need to clear my head...
Th-Thanks... I think I'm alright...
Did you see them? Those soldiers?
They looked like people, but they killed and killed with no hesitation...
If they attack us again, how can we hope to defend ourselves...?
