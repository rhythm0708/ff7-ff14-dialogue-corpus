If this plan succeeds, we'll have the power to lay the Empire low! To change the world for the better!
Might be as Gundobald's content to eke out an existence in this musty old cave, but I'll be damned if I'm going to spend the rest of my life here. Now, where in the seven hells did I put that bloody map?
O mighty Rhalgr, Lord of Destruction...we implore You, lend us Your strength and put an end to the suffering of Your people...
Hmph, here to interfere again? Well, you're too late. Our plan is already in motion.
Once we have the crystals, our enemies will pay for their crimes, and no one will dare oppress us ever again!
...Gone? The whole lot of them? Then it is as I feared─they mean to take matters into their own hands. But what exactly is it that they mean to do?
What's this? A hunting knife...and a map of Zanr'ak? ...Wait. You said Wilred spoke of crystals, did you not? But they couldn't possibly mean to─ By the gods, this is rank madness...
The young fools are untrained and unblooded, all. They have no notion of how dangerous the Amalj'aa are. They'll be butchered before they get within a hundred yalms of the crystals.
They are headed east. If we hurry, we may yet find them before it's too late.
Wilred... Did no others survive?
This is all wrong... Getting the crystals was supposed to be the start... We were going to reclaim our homeland... We were... We...
Pull yourself together, lad!
W-We were going to make an offering of crystals to Rhalgr─to summon Him, j-just like the masked man taught us.
We plotted to sneak into Zanr'ak and make off with the lizardmen's cache, b-but they caught us and...and... So many dead... Gods forgive me...
