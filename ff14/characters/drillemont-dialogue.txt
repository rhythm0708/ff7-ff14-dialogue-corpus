Ser Goudernoux permitted your passage? Very well. Speak.
You wish to brave a ruined outpost filled with scalekin to secure an airship that may or may not be there. Are you the avatar of the Fury Herself?
We are the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, Lord Drillemont. You know our name, and you know our deeds.
We are come to Coerthas to slay Garuda, Lady of the Vortex. To that end, we seek the Enterprise, the airship of Master Cid nan Garlond, who stands before you now.
Master Garlond, you're alive!? But that's impossible!
Indeed it is, my lord.
Do not be deceived by their honeyed words. These foreigners are not to be trusted.
At this critical moment in Ishgardian history, as House Durendaire marshals its forces to retake the Stone Vigil, who should appear in Whitebrim Front but three mysterious strangers...
Cid Garlond─missing and presumed dead since before the Calamity, and two Scions of the Seventh Dawn─a defunct band of misfits recently exterminated by the Empire.
The lesser houses may have been duped by these grandiose lies, but I should hope that House Durendaire would have greater sense. I know not why these three seek the Stone Vigil, but I know that we cannot permit them to pass.
Thank you for your counsel, Inquisitor. For a moment, I nearly believed this mummer's farce.
You three will not enter the outpost until we have reclaimed it─and until you declare your true intentions as well.
It could be moons before House Durendaire purges the dragons from the Stone Vigil. We cannot afford to wait that long!
Cid, Forename─we must do whatever it takes to earn Lord Drillemont's trust. Understood?
