Hm? You wish to know about our gods? What a curious visitor you are. Most want fish. In any case, I'm happy to oblige.
Now, I don't know how it is whence you hail, but our isle is home to many gods.
They can be divided into two groups: the Manusya, beings of wisdom who assume the form of men; and the Mrga, beings of might who assume the form of beasts.
Together They are divinities─Their forms and personalities many and varied.
Some are kind and gentle, others stern and temperamental─just like we mortals can be.
All are possessed of great insight and experience, and by heeding Their teachings, we strive to be better people and live better lives.
Different though They may be, both the Manusya and the Mrga are equally divine and equally revered.
