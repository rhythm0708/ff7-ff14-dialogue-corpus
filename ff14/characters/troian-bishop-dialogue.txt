Surprise, surprise.
I sense potent magicks from her. Have care.
That you should make it this far...No matter, I will devour you personally!

Surrender your souls to me!
Surrender your souls to me!

They're too strong... Someone else can devour them!
Hmph, she's quick on her feet if nothing else.
She may still be a threat. After her.
Terraces in the sky...
Do voidsent appreciate flowers too, I wonder...
