They think only of the prize─of the peace Ser Aymeric promises them. They know in their hearts it's a lie, but they go along with it anyway, desperate fools. But not I. Not I!
I see the wyrm that killed my brother in my dreams every night! And I will not rest until he lies broken at my feet! Him and every last one of his accursed kin!
All this nonsense about kings of eld. As if I care what they did or didn't do! Makes no difference to me and mine! Have the dragons sued for peace in a thousand years? Have they bollocks!
It's a bloody ruse is what it is! And Ser Aymeric and the rest of 'em've bloody fallen for it!
But what can we do? They believe, and naught we can say will ever change their minds.
Whether we like it or not, man and dragon will come together at Falcon's Nest, and all will be forgiven. Forgiven and forgotten.
No. I will not let that happen.
They will remember the true face of the enemy. I will show it to them. And we will rise up against them once more!
Hey! Hey! This is no time for napping!
Do you have your wits about you? Good. Come with me─we have a crisis on our hands!
Hear me, brothers and sisters! Do not be fooled by the honeyed words of the Dravanians! The peace they promise is but a prelude to slaughter!
Remember your husbands and wives, never returned from war! Your children, torn apart by fang and claw! All your loved ones, shown no mercy!
Does not your heart cry out for vengeance!? Your blood boil at the injustice!? Remember the face of your enemy, brothers and sisters! Remember it and strike back!
You there! Don't just stand around gawping! Do something, man! Stop her!
