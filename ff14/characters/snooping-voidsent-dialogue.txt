Not good... Lord Golbez must hear of this!
Without a master to rule us, it won't be long before we start preying on one another. And the weak are the first to be devoured. I must find someone strong to serve, and quickly...
Ahhh, my mistress... What must I do to bask in your sublime gaze once more?
You look tastier every time you walk by... <slurp> But I mustn't eat you... I mustn't eat you...
Not all voidsent can fly. It stands to reason that some would be made to serve as mounts.
Were I here in my true form, I would be able to carry you all. But even were it possible to so enlarge the gate, the risk would be too great.
Zero will best know how to handle the creatures. Let us watch and learn.
We should be able to find a mount here. With the castle in disarray, the creatures will be hungry. Just a little aether should suffice.
Are you ready?
There it is.
Good, it agrees to serve. Get on.
What is this place?
My domain.
In the beginning, it was a sanctuary for me alone.
But over time, others began to gather here. Those who had nowhere else to go.
A settlement of pariahs...
