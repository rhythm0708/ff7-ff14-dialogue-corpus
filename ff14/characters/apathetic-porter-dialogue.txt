Beg your pardon? You suspect that we porters have been planting draconian rosaries in House Haillenarte shipments!? What nerve! If you truly believe such nonsense, search our parcels and see what you find!
Are we finished? If so, I would appreciate an apology.
But...but that's impossible! Once the knight at Whitebrim Front concluded her inspection, I loaded the parcels into the wagon myself!
And if I had been the culprit, I would have never allowed you to search my shipments! Say what you will to Lord Haurchefant─I will not be held accountable for this!
Did something happen outside? I thought I heard shouting... Ah, but more importantly, what did Rickeman have to say?
More draconian rosaries!? In every single parcel bound for Skyfire Locks? That beggars belief!
Even the inquisitors must acknowledge that this is no more than a crass attempt to sully House Haillenarte's reputation. Whoever is responsible has overplayed his hand.
And praise Halone that he did! Lord Francel's trial is upon us, and we must act now if we are to clear his name!
From the very first, I knew it could not be that so many members of House Haillenarte were heretics. At last, we can give the lie to these poisonous allegations, and put an end to this travesty!
I will need to prepare a formal statement regarding these developments for the Holy See. In the meantime, I would have you bear my words to Inquisitor Brigie. Tell her that House Fortemps asks─nay, demands that Lord Francel's trial be postponed until a full investigation has been conducted!
