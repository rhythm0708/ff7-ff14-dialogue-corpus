It's not safe here, not anymore. I could try to leave Tural, but...where else is there to go?
You look like the well-traveled sort. Please, I can't stay hereâ”€but I fear nowhere in Tural is beyond the enemy's reach. What of the lands across the salt?
I know, I know. Even if I ran, I know I'd regret it in the end.
I love Tural. This is my home, and I know the Dawnservants would give their lives to defend her.
I will put my faith in them, and listen to what they have to say.
