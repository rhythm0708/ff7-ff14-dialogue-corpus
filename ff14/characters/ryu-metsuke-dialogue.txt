Well met, friend, and welcome to our festivities. I am known in my homeland of Hingashi as the ryu metsuke, and it is my delegation's solemn charge to share our Heavensturn custom with the peoples of Eorzea, that we might join hands in revelry.
Although Heavensturn is observed in both our lands to mark the coming of a new year, there is a difference between our traditions. Here in Eorzea, a deity is chosen from among the Twelve to preside over the heavens, while in the Far East we honor one of twelve noble beasts.
And this year, that beast is the mighty ryu─a creature you Eorzeans might liken to a dragon.
Now, in order to liven up the festivities, we decided to have a pair of horsebird hatchlings─or should I say chocobo chicks─serve as mascots.
Winsomely dressed in draconic attire, we were certain that they would delight all who laid eyes upon them.
However, when the ryu bugyo, the leader of our delegation, presented one of the chicks to a crowd, the reception was disappointingly muted. We know not where we erred...
...I say, you are an adventurer, are you not? In the course of dispensing aid, you must have acquired some insight into the people's interests.
Loath though I am to impose, will you not help us to identify our plan's failings? In so doing, we may yet find a way to win over the locals with our mascots.
You have my thanks! To begin, I ask that you seek out the ryu bugyo.
For want of passersby, she decided to wander around this plaza with her hatchling.
When you find her, pray ask for her account of our dilemma, and thence help us find a solution.
