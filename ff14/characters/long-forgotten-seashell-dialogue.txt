Why do you ask such a question? Do you not see the plague and pestilence that consumes us? Ours is a world of rancid blood and rotting flesh, where death is the only remedy to suffering. There is no meaning to be found in such misery.But it was not always thus... Beneath the waves we knew only peace and plenty. We wanted for naught, and yet craved more, that our progeny might someday flourish as we never could. Eventually we ventured to the lands above bearing flame and iron, toppling any who dared oppose our might.The world was ours for the taking.
It burns... BuRnS!
The pain...
Kill...me...
Until they cursed not the illness, but their fellow corrupted.



Gods, this is awful...




<gurgle>
To live only meant spreading this plague to others.
Those who lived and festered, those who died and decayed...
