Looking for Black Brush Station? Well, you've found it. This is where the wagonloads of ore from the Nanawa Mines end up.
The raw materials are refined inside. With the furnace blazing away in there, the air becomes so stiflingly hot... I much prefer to wait on the shipments out here.
Well done! It shan't be easy work to keep the tunnel free of coblyns, but our wagons should be able to go unmolested for a time.
Disruptions to ore shipments threaten not only the interests of Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern, but of Ul'dah herself. One might liken these train tracks to veins that bear our nation's lifeblood.
If only we had more women like you to lend a hand.
