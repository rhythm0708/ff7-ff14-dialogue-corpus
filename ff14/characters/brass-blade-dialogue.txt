We found her! We found the vein! Wystan, ye must come an' see!
Already!? Amazing! We leave at once!
You should join me, my friend! Come and bear witness to history in the making!
Thal's balls, son! A vein of ore in the middle of a ruined bloody city? Godsdamned idiot!
What did ye think was gonna happen? That ye'd strike it rich and get cozy with the Order, while the masters of Ul'dah looked on? No one crosses the Syndicate!
<pant> <pant> The...the Syndicate!?
Hah! Finally sunk in, has it?
Well look at this! Not all yer friends've deserted ye, it seems... Lucky boy! Now ye won't have to die alone!
O mournful voice of creation! Grant ye this humble stone a soul, that it may wake to life!
Who's that spoutin' gibberish!? Show yerself!
This ain't part o' the plan! Bloody hells, does Lord Lolorito mean to kill us too!?
You are strong. But are you strong enough to withstand this?
Impossible! Never has the golem been so sorely tested!
That the golem could be vanquished...
That woman is no ordinary adventurer.
Damn, seems I've missed all the fun.
I see you didn't need my help this time.
I would compose a ballad in your honor, but I fear no words would do you justice. The Songstress of Ul'dah herself could not rival your beauty.
