No! Oh, please gods, no! Leia's egg!
Forename, you must help me! I stepped out of the stables for but a moment, and when I returned it was gone!
I─ What was gone? An egg! Sorry? You are sure the chocobos will lay another!? Gah! You do not understand─the egg is extremely valuable! I must find it!
You will help me, won't you, Forename? Oh, thank you, thank you!
Someone must have made off with it. There can be no other explanation. I shall scour every ilm of the stable once more just to be sure. While I do so, I should be very grateful if you would ask the others if they noticed anything unusual.
