There's not much I can say about Gobli, but I can tell you what Gobli's been saying...
The other day, he was muttering about monsters prowling around Agave Jaws─that's the field where they gather ingredients for the mezcal.
Their presence has made it harder to procure said ingredients, and thus driven up the price of his product─a boon, some might argue, but it's hard to celebrate when it affects the work as it does. Can't rightly bring joy to people if you can't keep making the thing they love.
Hiring mercenaries to come and cull the threats would eat into profits. I bet Gobli would be glad to find a less expensive solution...
