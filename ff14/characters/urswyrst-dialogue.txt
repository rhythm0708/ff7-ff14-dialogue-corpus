Ghimthota sent you to follow up on my report?
Well, it was not too long ago that I saw some unsavory sort slinking along the top of the bluff near Empty Heart, just over yonder.
It may be that he's still about. If you've got the time, adventurer, I'd much appreciate you getting up there to take a look.
Hail, adventurer. Glad to have another hand aboard to help shore up security.
The gods know our reports would sit on Ghimthota's desk gathering dust if it weren't for the assistance of those such as yourself.
Speaking of reports, though, I saw one of those mangy pirates lurking around the cliff near Empty Heart. I'd take a closer look before he has a chance to cover his tracks.
