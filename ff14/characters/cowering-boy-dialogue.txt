These decorations are so scary... You're not here to trick me, are you?
This one is ripe for the picking, hehe... Ahem! F-Forget I said anything. So? What type of ghoul do you suggest?

Hehe, if you really think so...
Eeeeeek! ...Huh?
...You know, when you look at it, it's actually kind of cute. The puff of smoke was a little scary though!
I think I'm beginning to understand. If a fright doesn't kill your kind, it can actually be somewhat...pleasant!
I believe I'm ready to take the proverbial stab at it! Come, come; there should be more pumpkins around Apkallu Falls.
It gets cuter every time I look at it. I wonder if any of the other pumpkins will transform.
