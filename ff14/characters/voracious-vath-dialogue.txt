You are generous hunters, yes? Many gifts you have brought, but not enough for all Vath to enjoy. Maybe you could bring us just one more?
We are very fond of nanka flesh. Yes, the meat of a young nanka would make a fine repast.
We Vath do enjoy our nanka flesh. Have you been out hunting yet...?
Another gift for the Vath!? So unexpected! Mmm, yes, you will have more of the words you strange hunters hunger for. Listen, now.
The senses of the Onemind are enmeshed by the Overmind─what one sees, all see; what one feels, all feel.
Alert a single Gnath, and the whole hive is alerted. To reach our god undetected is all but impossible!
The Vath are wont to allude to certain concepts without explanation, but I believe I am beginning to grasp a few of the fundamentals.
From what I understand, the king-like “Overmind” sits at the center of Gnath society, and its presence somehow allows its subjects to communicate without need of word or gesture.
These Gnath─the ones who inhabit the larger hive─are known as the “Onemind,” and it was by their combined will that the primal was summoned.
Those who reside in this smaller hive, however, are the Vath─or the “Nonmind”─who, for reasons that yet escape me, seem to have been excluded from the telepathic bond which connects their Gnath counterparts. Thus are the Vath ignorant of the Onemind's thoughts and intentions.
...And of the nature of their own god. In summary, we have wasted our time.
Not so. Perilous though it may be, the Vath did furnish us with one certain method of approaching the primal: as sacrifices. Should we allow ourselves to be captured in the environs of the colony, the Gnath will bring us before their deity to make an offering of our souls...
Forgive me, but let us be clear about what it is that you propose. You mean to say that you would deliberately provoke the Gnath, surrender yourself into what might generously be termed their “custody,” and then wait until their god arrives to claim your soul?
Aye, that fairly well describes my plan. You will join me in this endeavor, will you not, Forename?
Judging by the great risks you took to prevent the summoning of Saint Shiva, you are not a woman to err on the side of caution.
...Would that I could fight at your side, Warrior of Light. But the power of the dragon is no protection against primal influence. Forgive me, but I must remain here with Master Alphinaud.
Then it is settled. Forename, you and I shall challenge the guards at the entrance to the colony. Once the hive is roused, we shall feign a brief show of resistance, and then allow them to take us prisoner.
