It has been far, far too long, Lord Artoirel. And who might your companion be?
Pray forgive us our lateness, Ser Redwald. I present to you Forename Surname, ward of House Fortemps.
Ahhh, yes, of course! Lord Drillemont spoke of you. I, Ser Redwald of House Durendaire, do bid you welcome to Falcon's Nest.
We are both eager to contribute to the settlement's restoration. How may we be of service?
Before we speak of that─would I be correct in assuming that Mistress Surname is unfamiliar with our recent history? Then, with your permission, I shall recount the tale for her benefit.
As you may know, Falcon's Nest was once a hamlet with a small garrison of knights and some few villagers. And then came the Calamity.
When it became clear that the snow would not stop falling, we had no choice but to order a complete withdrawal. The settlement─and the entirety of the western highlands─were to be abandoned.
...Abandoned to the heretics. Lady Iceheart and her kind have walked these lands with impunity ever since.
Aye, but no longer. The Holy See has commanded the reclamation of the western highlands and the expulsion of heretical elements.
Falcon's Nest is key to accomplishing these objectives. But, as you can see, rebuilding the hamlet will be no small undertaking.
Our craftsmen require support and protection. Any assistance you can offer will be greatly appreciated.
As promised, we of House Fortemps are at your disposal, Ser Redwald. You need but tell us where to begin.
Several craftsmen in service to House Dzemael are contributing to the restoration of Falcon's Nest.
These men and women are quite skilled at building and repairing fortifications, but their progress has been hampered by a number of factors.
Rothe, their foreman, tells me he has need of a woman with your talents. Would you be so kind as to seek him out?
