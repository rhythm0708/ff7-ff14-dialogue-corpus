I'd heard Erenville was looking for passage to Tuliyollal, so I managed to squeeze his party aboard one of our chartered vessels. As fortune would have it, we had just scheduled an expedition to Tural.
I'm told this vessel has been equipped with a barrier generator to protect it from storms.
A reassuring thoughtâ”€though I nevertheless pray there will be no need for it...
