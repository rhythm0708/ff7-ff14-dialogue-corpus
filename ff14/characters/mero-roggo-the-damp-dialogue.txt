It will be my pleasure to show you to the Clearnote Cauldron, ribbit. Please use this portal.
That gushing sound... There must be a water vein.
Correct, and believe me when I say it's icy cold. Watch your step.
For your own safety, I ask that you keep close to me, ribbit.
Please wait while I move the lift, ribbit.
The little spring yonder ought to put a spring in your step, ribbit.
Another lift, ribbit. Just a moment...
I sense a mischievous presence, ribbit... Please take care.
That familiar was made with stormwaterâ”€and it plays rough. Have care.
When even Y'shtola advises caution...
