Mistress Surname, Master Alphinaud. As you can see, the gate is ours.
Be advised that our scouts are reporting increased activity around the First Mountain. Simply put, they are up to something, and don't want anyone interfering.
We stand ready to escort you to Xelphatol and aid you as you see fit.
The enemy will be thick on the ground. Upon arriving, let us advance with care as we search for the site of the summoning ritual.
If the gods are good, we should only have to contend with the Ixalâ”€but if they are not, we may be forced to do battle with the Warriors of Darkness...
Falling rocks to add to the danger...
Let us proceed with caution.
It's over if we're crushed.
