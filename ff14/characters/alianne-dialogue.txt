Grandfather and I are companions on the road.
We travel where the wind takes us, and drink in all the wonders this world has to offer.
Only an adventurer can understand the joy of such freedomâ”€of discovering hidden places and experiencing sights and sounds that few may ever know.
The passing years have begun to take their toll on the old man, but no force save death itself will sate his appetite for adventure!
