Good morning, sir. I assume you're the underdressed “gentleman” Baderon mentioned?
<sniff> I see he was not exaggerating...
Ahem. I've chosen these especially for your debut in polite society. Fear not, I'm certain you will absolutely adore them.
Been to see J'nasshym, 'ave ye? Let's 'ave that box, then.
'Ere we go...a nice pair o' dress shoes fer ye.
A bloke mightn't 'ave much else to 'is name, but so long as 'e's got a decent pair o' shoes on 'is feet, there ain't nowhere 'e can't go.
Think of 'em as a gift from me an' all the other folk ye've done right by along the way.
Aye, aye...'tis a very movin' gesture, I know. Just don't go wellin' up on me, eh? Wouldn't do fer Limsa's new 'ero to turn up at the banquet soaked in 'is own tears an' snot. Anyroad, that's yer garb sorted. Now, ye just need to settle yer nerves. Tell me when yer ready, an' I'll tell ye where yer meant to go.
Yer ready, then, are ye? Good. The banquet'll be startin' soon. If ye'd waited any longer, I'd've considered it me civic duty to 'it ye over the 'ead an' drag ye there.
Now, make sure yer wearin' them fancy shoes when ye turn up, all right? Carryin' 'em won't do no good. They're meant to make ye look like a gentleman, remember, not a gentleman's bleedin' lackey.
As fer directions, the feast's bein' 'eld on the Bridge, in the Admiral's briefin' room.
Speak with Zanthael in Bulwark Hall, an' 'e'll show ye the way.
Just keep that 'ead 'eld 'igh, lad. After everythin' ye've done fer Limsa, ye've good reason to be proud─an' don't let no 'ighborn bugger tell ye different.
