No one comes and goes from this dungeon without permission. For you, though, I'll make an exception. Go on, go.
There appears to be someone within...
Could this be the clever voidsent?
I mislike the feel of this. Stay on your guard.
You...
You are...the friend?
I see it now. The bottomless darkness. The insatiable hunger. The aura was present when we faced him in Garlemald.
How did it come to be here?
Zenos? The disgraced prince you yourself laid low?
I see it now. The bottomless darkness. The insatiable hunger. The aura was present when we faced him in Garlemald.
When Zenos died, its connection to the Source was severed. It was forced to return to the void.
Zenos...
Yes, that was his name. And you are the friend, are you not?
Is that...Hydaelyn's crystal!?
But how?
The light just now... Of course. And thus I am returned...
What do you mean, “returned”? Who are you?
I was once bound to the man named Zenos.
His “avatar”─until you killed him.
“Avatar” as in the voidsent servants of reapers.
In the name of his hunt, Zenos took up that traditional Garlean art.
And through it, he forged a covenant with a being of the void to lend him strength.
“Covenant”? A curse, more like. He stole my power. There was no equity in the arrangement.
My very essence was altered. Twisted into a tool to serve his desires.
Your previous appearance. This is your true form, then?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. What does it matter?
Indeed. It doesn't.
Regardless of your form, you are a voidsent by nature.
So answer me this: are you our enemy too?
In this world, only a fool would attempt to devour a stronger being.
And though it was as an avatar, I lost to you once. I have no desire to lose again.
Good enough for me.
Now, you will answer me a question.
Zenos called you “friend.” That's what you are? A friend?
So...you're not a friend?
Then...
What is it? What is a friend?
Hissssss...
When I served Zenos, my mind was shrouded in haze. But one thing was always clear─his obsession with the “friend.”
What the word means, I do not know exactly. I know only that it referred to you, and that yours was an important existence.
Zenos's avatar, eh? What are the odds.
We still know little about her, but for now I'm glad we found someone who can do more than moan for aether.
I assume the dungeon was reserved for those intended for the mistress's consumption.
'Tis fortunate that we came here when we did. Fateful, even.
