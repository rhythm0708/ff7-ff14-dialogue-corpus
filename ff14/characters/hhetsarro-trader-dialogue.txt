Help! Heeelp!
A tturuhhetso is coming this way!
It has beasts across the plains in a panicâ”€and our rroneek are practically paralyzed with fear. We must get them to safety!
We can assist by helping to calm the creatures. Once they're less agitated, it should be possible to herd them.
And after they're out of harm's way, we'll deal with the rroreek reaver!
I suggest you remain here to attend to the rroneek when they arrive.
They'll be safe with me. Please be careful out there.
Make haste! We must protect the rroneek.
Don't worry, we're right behind you.
Eyes peeled for anything brown and fluffy!
It would be fortunate if they ran this way...
