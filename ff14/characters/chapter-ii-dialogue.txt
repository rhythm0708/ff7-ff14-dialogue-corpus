The Milalla are the keepers of a mighty relic passed down through the ages. While it has the appearance of a crystal, by whose hand it was wrought is unknown.
When a great calamity froze their isles, the Speaker, their spiritual leader, fervently prayed to the relic for salvation.
In answer to their prayers, the relic opened for them a golden path, one that shone like the light of dawn, and through it they fled unto a new land.
