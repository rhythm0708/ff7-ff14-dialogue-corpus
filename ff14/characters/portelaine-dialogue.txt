You've caused quite a stir in your short time here. First you slay two heretics and save a knight, and now I hear you have rescued a man of our house. I imagine you must desire something for your troubles.
An introduction to the other High Houses? I cannot deny that you have given us no cause to distrust you. But while you have performed two acts, you would have me endorse you to three High Houses. It is only fitting that you aid us one final time, wouldn't you agree?
Now, now, I understand you are very eager to find your missing airship. Worry not, for this task should take a woman of your skills but a moment to complete.
Not long ago, a porter bound for Skyfire Locks was ambushed on the road due west of here. Though he escaped with his life, he would very much like his wares as well. On the off chance any portion of his shipment remains, I would have you travel to the scene of the robbery and bring back what you find.
Lest you intend to perform only a cursory search, bear in mind that recovering the stolen merchandise will endear you to House Haillenarte, further improving the chances that they indulge your request for aid.
Have you good tidings to share? Or better yet, stolen merchandise to show?
