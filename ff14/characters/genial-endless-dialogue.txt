Oh, hello there. Taking in the sights of Canal Town too, are you? Both my wife and I just adore this place.
We had become estranged in life, she and I, but being here gave us the chance to reconcile.
I couldn't be more grateful for the chance to spend these blessed little moments together again.
I have no more regrets. Whether Her Majesty's plan succeeds or no, I can rest with peace in my heart.
Well, we shall continue on our way, but we hope to see you again. Till next time.
