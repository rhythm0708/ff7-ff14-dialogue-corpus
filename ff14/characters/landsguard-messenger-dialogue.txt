At last...
Welcome back, madamsir. You've had a Landsguard messenger most anxiously waiting on your return.
Forename of the Third Promise's entourage? I've been all over the city looking for you.
The Dawnservant summons you to the palace. You are to present yourself to the gate guard stationed outside Sunperch at your earliest convenience.
Oh, and one more thing: you are not to mention this visit to Wuk Lamat.
A personal audience with the Dawnservant... What could it be about?
