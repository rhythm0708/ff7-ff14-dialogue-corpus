I'm with Oblivion. Cahciua has told me all.
So we just have to make our way up. Seems nice and straightforward to me.
We're going to ride that oversized container, are we? Don't worry─you won't catch me mewling over a little seasickness. Not anymore.
Visibility is quite poor, but let us trust in our allies to ferry us safely over.
A facility for processing souls... As distressing as the very concept is, I confess I'm curious to see the technology employed.
I will now explain how this mission will unfold.
Origenics takes delivery at specific times. It is at one such time that we will enter the facility, aboard the hover cargo.
Kiluwsa here will pilot the vehicle, so you need only sit tight until we arrive at the entrance.
Our friends in the Backroom will create a diversion so we can steal inside.
After which we make our way to the summit, striking down any foes that bar our path!
Easy, yes?
Easy to say, perhaps... But we'll manage one way or another!
That we will!
In anticipation of the unexpected, we should maintain contact with the support crew and adapt as necessary.
Indeed. I shall use the communicator I borrowed from Shale to keep them informed at all times.
I see everyone has a grasp of the details. Good. We set off very soon, so be ready!
The hover cargo is borrowed from a reforger friend. She was relieved to hear that Gulool Ja is safe.
I'm told you saved Wayakkwe─thank you. I'll be praying for your safety and success.
With the danger passed in Tuliyollal, we can fight without worry!
Koana has done his part. Now I must finish things here.
I expect that Alexandria's military might lies with Origenics. We must be prepared to meet with fierce resistance.
Zoraal Ja cannot be allowed to cause any more harm. I will do my part to stop him.
I see you've arrived. Follow the path and you'll soon see the entrance. Be careful now.
This body isn't made for combat, so I'll hang back.
Understood!
Right, let's do this!
