This is unacceptable. I was promised no distractions!
If this is the best they can offer, I should have never left Wachumeqimeqi...
You see? The potsworn desert us! Without enough healthy helphands, we are failing to uphold our side of the potpact!
Should all our potsworn leave, Earthenshire will grind to a halt! We have to do something, and do it soon!
Then let us stand in for the injured helpers! It would give me the chance to learn more about your people and your village, and if it brings us closer to beginning the feat, then all the better!
This isn't strictly part of the contest, so don't feel obligated to join in. Take a rest while you can.
I was hoping you'd say that! I actually wasn't sure I could do this on my own.
We'll all help. I doubt any of us could just sit around and watch.
What Forename means to say is we'll all help. I doubt any of us could just sit around and watch.
I was hoping you'd feel that way! I actually wasn't sure I could do this on my own.
We'll take every helphand we can get. Rediroq truthswears that once the potsworn have their perfect workshops again, we will commence the feat with all haste!
You and the Third Promise can assist helphand Rakorok.
You other four, follow Rediroq. There are other helphands in need of hand-lending!
I really appreciate you pitching in.
I meant what I said at Many Fires. There'll be no more feigning strength. No more playing at being an invincible Promise.
If there's one thing I've learned on this journey, it's how practiced you are at aiding those in need.
And I mean to make the most of having such an incredible mentor at my side!
Now, let's find this Rakorok fellow and see what we can do for him.
I think I've found our helphand. First we'll solve this problem for the Moblins, then we'll see about completing their feat!
