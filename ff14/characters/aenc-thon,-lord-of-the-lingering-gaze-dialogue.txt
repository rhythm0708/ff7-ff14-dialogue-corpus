Ah, our guests have arrived!
That their chieftain should personally stand in our way...
If it stands in our way, it falls like the rest.
It's the Fuath way to give guests a smashing welcome!
Oh yes, we'll smash you! To bits and pieces!
Bravo, bravo! Very impressive!
Do keep up that fine form the rest of the way!
We did it! We won!
No. It was just toying with us.
Look! The landscape is changing!
It seems they haven't quite had enough games.
'Twould seem our trials do continue.
Onward, my friends! Onward to your prize!
Oh dear, I seem to have dropped a wasp nest! How very clumsy of me!
A wasp nest? Really?
Ah, yes, the good old stop-them-with-wasps trick.
My apologies, but accidents do happen!
Come and play in my beautiful garden!
Curious... Yonder creature doth resemble Griaule, a beast of Voeburtite legend.
They recreated a legend, is that it?
Let's cut this overgrown scrub down to size.
This beast falleth short of the legend.
Imitation will only take you so far.
A palace of water... It's like something out of a faerie tale...
Except we're the ones in the tale. Stay on your guard.
Welcome! Welcome to our humble palace!
Keep running! You're almost there!
That way! The crown's that way!
The crown! We've found it!
Awww, it's a fake! You'll just have to keep going!
No, stop! I smell a trap!
Bravo! Bravo!
More! We want to see more!
'Twould seem we are come to the grand finale.
This time we'll really have the crown!
Focus on the fight, Minfiliaâ”€not the prize.
