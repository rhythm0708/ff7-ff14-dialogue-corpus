...Yes? How can I assist you and your...curiously dressed chocobo chick?
If I may shed some light on the mystery of our mascot, little Ryunosuke here is named for the ryuâ”€dragons of the Far East.
Oh? I thought dragons are supposed to be fearsome. This fellow looks anything but.
Our costumed companion notwithstanding, the ryu is in fact a powerful and fearsome beast. Yet by the same token, they are fondly regarded as symbols of good fortune. Should you be curious about them, we would be glad to tell you more at the Aftcastle.
A being that's regarded with both fear and fondness... Intriguing. Perhaps I'll pay a quick visit to the Aftcastle before returning to work.
Oh, what a relief to see the locals take an interest in the ryu! I daresay we have gathered enough people, so let us head back to the Aftcastle.
Come, my friend! Let us rejoin the ryu metsuke at the Aftcastle.
In that case, I shall go on ahead to the Aftcastle with Ryunosuke. See you there anon.
There you are, adventurer. Come, let us report to the ryu metsuke.
Kweh, kweh!
Look how exicted Ryunosuke is for the gathered crowd! Come, let us report to the ryu metsuke!
Ah, welcome back, adventurer. If the crowd is any indication, you and the ryu bugyo have been busy!
Just how powerful are these ryu...?
Oh, to be a chocobo chick in a dragon costume...
How precious!
Sounds like it'll be smooth sailing for me this year!
Hm. Maybe I should get me own blessin'...
So our bugyo makes her triumphant return! You have done a tremendous job to pique the interest of so many.
You are too kind, metsuke. None of this would have been possible without the adventurer and Ryunosuke's help.
There you are, miss! My papa wanted to meet you, so I've brought him.
