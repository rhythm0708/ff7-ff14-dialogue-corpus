I've had far worse than this lot.
Not sin eaters by the look of them.
Whatever they are, they're not to be trifled with.
Keep it steady, eh, catboy? Don't want no arrow in my arse by accident.
Whaâ”€!? Do you take me for a craven!?
Compared to the Virtues, this is just a relaxing diversion!
Not bad, you lot!
I won't be outdone!
Ugh, I would kill for a drink right now...
When this is over, I'll buy you as many as you want!
Oho, does that offer extend to me as well?
Save the talk for the tavern! We're not out of the woods yet!
Not ashamed to admit the offer of drinks has me fired up!
