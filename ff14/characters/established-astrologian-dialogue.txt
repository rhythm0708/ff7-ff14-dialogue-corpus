What a relief to see someone other than a godsdamned birdman! I thought I could finish my work whilst the Ixal were away, but they returned far quicker than I anticipated. It was all I could do to hide and hope they might leave again before I froze toâ”€
Wait, who are you!? You are not one of our knights!
A man of House Durendaire cannot be seen in the company of an unbeliever! Good day, madam!
The arrogant fool returned not long before you arrived, muttering about the disgrace of having been rescued by an unbeliever. Serves him right for underestimating the dangers our knights face every day.
Ah, but you are eager to locate your airship. It may surprise you that by saving him, you have already aided your own cause.
House Durendaire is quick to regard outsiders with suspicion, as it is their duty to sound the alarm at the first sign of Dravanian aggression. Yet you have already aided them twice, for which they are honor-bound to repay you.
Even so, they will not grant you access to the Observatorium's records. That is just as well, for there are other ways you might locate your missing airship.
What I propose is that you petition Lord Portelaine for an official introduction to the other High Houses. The word of House Durendaire carries tremendous weight in Ishgard. Should the captain consent, you would have little trouble obtaining information from the other High Houses.
