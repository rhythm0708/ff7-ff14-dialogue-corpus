Greetings, Mistress Surname. I've saddled a black chocobo for your journey to the western highlands, as per Lord Artoirel's instruction.
Will this be your first time riding a black chocobo, may I ask? If so, you're in for a treat. As I daresay you know, this particular breed can fly. Given the right conditions, they can carry you quite high, too─even over Snowcloak.
You needn't worry about directing the bird, of course. Like all porters, she's trained to carry you to your destination all by herself─so just relax and enjoy the view! Oh, but be sure not to relax your grip, will you? Two hands on the reins at all times, if you please.
To the frozen wastes of the western highlands, once verdant tracks made pallid by the Calamity...
Beyond the towering wall of ice, to lands long forsaken that the knights of Ishgard strove tirelessly to reclaim...
To the hamlet of Falcon's Nest, once abandoned, now freed of its pall of snow and ash, she came...
The world looks quite different when viewed from the back of an airborne chocobo, does it not? I still find the experience strangely liberating...
To business. Ser Redwald is in charge here. He should be expecting us.
