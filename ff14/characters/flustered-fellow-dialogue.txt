Oh gods...oh gods!
Oh gods, where has she gotten to!?
Ah, this must be the fellow my senses were leading me to. Shall we find out what ails him?
You, there. What's gotten you so worked up?
Oh, forgive me! There was this poor little girl who'd been separated from her mother. I was helping her to look, but she suddenly disappeared!
I can't simply abandon herâ”€but then again, I have an urgent personal matter to attend to, and... <sigh> I don't know what to do!
In that case, why don't I and my associate look for the girl? Then you can see to your affairs without worry.
Thank you, thank you! She's a young lass dressed in blue! I hope you're able to find her forthwith!
Hmm... He certainly was appreciative, yet here I am, empty-handed. Ah, forget the food, we have a lost child to find!
I'm detecting a despairing presence to the east of here. Odds are it's the girl. Which means I have need of your navigational nous once again. After you!
I should've known you'd turn up sooner or later.
