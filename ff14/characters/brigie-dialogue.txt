What is it, my child? Hm? Lord Haurchefant would have the inquisitors do what?
But that is not possible. Inquisitor Guillaime presides over Lord Francel's trial at Witchdrop even as we speak.
Fear not: if Lord Francel is indeed innocent, he shall walk in Halone's halls with the fallen heroes of Ishgard.
They have taken Lord Francel to Witchdrop!? This is madness! The inquisitor does not have sufficient grounds to subject him to that manner of trial!
I will not stand idly by and allow an innocent man to die. Forename, I would dispatch you and one of my knights to Witchdrop to forestall the proceedings until such time as I am able to join you and petition Inquisitor Guillaime in person. I will endeavor not to keep you waiting too long.
Do whatever you must to keep Lord Francel alive!
