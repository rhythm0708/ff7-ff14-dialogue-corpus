Well now, the Warrior of Darkness and the Oracle of Light both! How may I be of service?
Your enemies plot to invade your world!? Having heard tales of sin eaters ravaging countless villages, your plight feels all too familiar...
Come what may, I urge you to remain strong. You overcame the Lightwardensâ”€you can overcome any adversity. And for what it's worth, I'm sure everyone here would be willing to help in whatever way we can.
Have courage, my friend. You saved our world once before, and I have faith you will save your own. That said, if I or my brethren can be of assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.
When Vauthry tried to keep us out of the city, many free citizens died in the chaos.
Some had no kin to inherit their wealth, and so Eulmore decided to use it to help fund the reconstruction of the Derelicts.
It's part of a greater effort to improve the living conditions down here, which is important since there's simply not enough room for everyone in the city proper.
That thing there cleaning up the debris... For a moment I thought it might be a voidsent.
In case you didn't know, it's not uncommon for our kind to use statues as vessels.
But I see now that it's more akin to the mechanical soldiers used by the Garleans. They come in all shapes and sizes, don't they?
