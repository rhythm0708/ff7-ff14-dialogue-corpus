Foreign peddlers? In Namai? Whatever it is you sell, I have no money to buy. Perhaps you should go elsewhere.
Saying that, I know of no village in Yanxia that has fared any better. Once, I would have directed you to the samurai lords of Monzenâ”€had they not all died in battle or in the purges.
There is the Doman Enclave, of course, but that lies beyond the Dairyu Moon Gates. Needless to say, the imperials are disinclined to let any but their own pass.
Forename. What have you learned?
Lyse and I encountered much of the same. They have been pushed beyond the brink.
I expected frustration and disillusionment, but not so much that they would come to question the wisdom of opposing imperial rule in the first place...
Unless we can convince them otherwise, I fear I cannot convince Lord Hien to return, and without him...
Let us not yet lose hope. Though the situation in Namai is bleak, mayhap it is not so elsewhere.
I wish to speak with others outside the village. Lyse and I will look for farmers in the paddies to the east. Forename, I ask that you look to the south.
Surely they cannot all have given in to despair...
