Let us aid you, my lord!
What? I thought I ordered you to leave!
Forgive us, my lord, but we couldn't let you face the enemy alone!
We've raised the alarm as you bade...and now we would fight with you!
Your conviction and courage will not be for naught! This I swear!
For victory and vengeance, I will strike you down!
Ignore pain... Ignite rage... And fight with the fury of wildfire!
You will have no mercy from me!
<pant> <pant> You are stronger than I had expected...
But I have my honor! I cannot─I will not yield!
Hah, I have you now!
We shall go together, amidst a raging inferno!
No amount of pain can loosen my grip!
Ungh... You will not escape...
Rest in peace, men... I shall join you soon...
<pant> <pant> It's over... Strong as you are, you cannot survive this!
<gasp> <pant>
Forgive me... I have failed you...
Lord van Baelsar!!!
That light─ <gasp> The magitek transporter!
Forename, are you there? What news of Rhitahtyn? ...Fallen?
With this deed, you have sown the seeds of our ultimate victory.
The fading of that light presages an end to the Empire's tyranny!
Rhitahtyn sas Arvina is no more!
Let the next phase of Operation Archon commence!
HURRAH!
'Tis I! It seems you've done it again, Forename!
I'd raise a tankard to you, but I'm afraid we've no time to savor the victory. There's still the small matter of infiltrating Castrum Meridianum and destroying the Ultima Weapon!
I know, I know...no rest for the preternaturally gifted. Now stop feeling sorry for yourself, and make your way back to the Immortal Flames' encampment. The communications officer will issue you your orders. I'll be waiting for you with the main host.
Look, Hydaelyn─Your minion comes...bringing the Light.
Alas, the gate to the void already stands open. Soon, Darkness shall consume all, and you shall bow down before the one true god.
Ahahahahaha!
The praefectus...slain?
