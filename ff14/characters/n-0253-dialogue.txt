Bzzzt... Measuring combat capability...Result: negligible. Subject falls outside targeting parameters.
Greetings, traveler. We are the Omicrons, and our objective is self-enhancement.
In order to achieve this, we venture forth in conquest to acquire combat data and resources.
Most recently, we succeeded in subjugating the home world of the beings whose strength was said to be without parallel: the dragons.
Yet though the endeavor yielded a wealth of combat data, the star was rendered barren and unable to yield resources. A subsequent costing determined that the losses incurred exceeded the gains.
Since conquering the dragons, no new instructions have come from Sir, but we stand ready for deployment.
