Hurrah!
Thanks to you, Biggs and Wedge are with us again.
Now we must find a way to rescue Minfilia and the others. Gods know we've kept them waiting too long already.
Based on what we've learned, I believe it's safe to say they're being held at Castrum Centri.
So let us convene at Revenant's Toll in Mor Dhonaâ”€'tis as good a place as any to prepare, and better than most. The road leading east then south will get you there.
When we arrive, let us seek the advice of the local adventurers. We're bound to learn a thing or two that will benefit our mission.
