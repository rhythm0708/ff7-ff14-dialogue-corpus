A visitor. Not of this star...
Could thy slender hands bring plague to our world... Thy breath extinguish life's feeble flame... Oh, how we would adore thee. Alas...
With time our flesh shall wither, our souls fade. And so we wait for its inexorable march unto oblivion.
If thou art not come to hasten our demise, I bid thee leave us. We crave not companionship. Only silence.
I pray thee leave us to our silence. To break it serves only to mark time's passage. We shall not suffer reminders of its flow.
