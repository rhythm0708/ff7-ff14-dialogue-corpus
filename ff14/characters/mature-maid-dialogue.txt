You want to hear an old maid's stories, do you? Aye, well most of what I know of the mad king is common knowledge.
We'd only see His Royal Majesty when he deigned to attend the executions he'd ordered. And after a while, even watching his “enemies” die wasn't enough to coax him out of hiding.
They say he started seeing assassins in every shadow, and wouldn't set foot outside the palace walls. I was offered work there as a royal servant once, but the mere thought of it left me in a cold sweat...
