Are you really a mortal? I've never seen a mortal before...
You're one of the mortals! Is it true? When you die over there, you really die?
So it is, so it is! What brings you here, then?
Ah yes, Golbez. He seeks strong minions to grow his army, so I hear.
But recently, he stopped doing that. Instead, he devours all.
Perhaps he's gathered enough fodder and is now intent on bolstering his own strength. A sure sign that he is about to make a move.
Satisfied with what you've learned? Ah─but let's step away before you become too tempting to resist.
By the way, why haven't you died already? Over there, you can do so any time, no? Don't miss your chance, or you'll end up like us.
It seems the rumors of Golbez reach even my remote domain.
Fair to assume he's gathering strength for his crusade─whatever that may be.
But I must say, I wouldn't have guessed that Farfarello once fought in Golbez's army. It's a miracle he survived serving an archfiend.
Ah, I suppose I should explain.
Farfarello is the weakest among us. Constantly in fear of being devoured, he seldom consorts with others.
The only one he's comfortable with is Ciriatto.
He's a fellow coward who runs the instant he senses a threat, and won't stop until he's exhausted.
When their hunger grows too intense, they feed on each other's aether. Such is their relationship.
But I ramble. You intend to seek out Farfarello, I presume?
Then I'll come with you. He's less likely to hide that way.
Then I'll come with you. He's less likely to hide that way.
Not only did the mortals conquer Troia─they defeated Scarmiglione?
I struggle to believe it...
