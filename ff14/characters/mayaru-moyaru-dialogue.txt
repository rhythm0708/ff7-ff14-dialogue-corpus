Come one, come all! The Moonfire Faire is here to offer the realm's beleaguered citizens a diversion from the sun's scorching rays, and seeks volunteers from among the Adventurers' Guild's ranks!
Ah, my prayers are answered! As the sun beat down upon my brow, my flagging spirits were kept aloft by the hope of your return. Now that you're here, I can say that the Moonfire Faire's success is assured!
Our festival has a long and storied history that hardly bears repeating, but for all intents and purposes, it's become the premier event of our guild. We hope to stoke the fires of adventurous hearts young, old, and all ages in between!
This season's main event has become a favorite among adventurers and revelers alike: the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course! Keeping vigil over the proceedings is the Sunshine Savior, guardian of the sandy beaches!
Who is the Sunshine Savior, you ask? If your interest has been piqued, then I encourage you to make haste to Costa del Sol, where Haermaga stands at the ready to apprise eager volunteers of the details!
Haermaga awaits to induct eager volunteers for this year's Moonfire Faire. Attend to him and you may even be fortunate enough to meet the fabled Sunshine Savior yourself!
