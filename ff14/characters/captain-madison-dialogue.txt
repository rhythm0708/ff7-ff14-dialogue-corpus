How did ye find this place!?
Scurvy dog! Scurvy dog! Squawk!
Me loyal pups!
Come closer. I'll slit yer throat and toss yer corpse to the mad serpent.
Batten down the hatches! Batten down the hatches! Squawk!
Wh-Where are me men!? Wh-Where are me maidens!?
Cap'n is strong! Cap'n is strong! Squawk!
Try an' catch me, ye two-legged lubber!
Two-legged lubber! Two-legged lubber! Squawk!
Where has he run off to...? Best we keep on our guard.
