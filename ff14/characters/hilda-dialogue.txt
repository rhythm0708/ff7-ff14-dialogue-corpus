Enough! Leave threatenin' women and children to our “betters”! We don't have the knack!
Hilda!?
Lay a finger on the blue bloods' pups and you're like to lose the hand.
It ain't often I get called on by glorious heroes like yourself. So tell me: what have I done to deserve you?
Before you start─let's go somewhere a bit more private, eh? The Forgotten Knight, say.
...So while you were on your way to kill Nidhogg, you stumbled on some dirty secrets that the Holy See has been hidin' for centuries.
Eh? What are they on about?
The High Houses, and what makes a nobleman so bleedin' noble. They trace their blood back to King Thordan and his knights twelve─the founders of Ishgard.
But our friends here reckon we're all descended from the heroes of eld─highborn and lowborn alike.
And so Ser Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights, has gone to ask the archbishop if he wouldn't mind lettin' everyone know.
Is he simple!? The old bastard'll have him executed for heresy!
Well, seems to me that's what the good ser wants. Seems he thinks a noble sacrifice will serve to prove his claims.
We cannot stand idly by and allow Ser Aymeric to do this. Ishgard has need of him.
Look, you've a good heart. I can see that. Willin' to risk your neck for someone else, even when his troubles ain't yours. But what's this got to do with me?
If Ser Aymeric is imprisoned in the Vault, we will need all the help we can muster to breach their defenses and rescue him.
What in the hells─!?
