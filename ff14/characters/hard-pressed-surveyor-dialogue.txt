Someone help!
Yaaargh! Taste my axe!
Aaahhh!
These animals are usually so docile...
What has happened to this island?
They leave us no choice...
Are you all right?
Yes, thanks to you.
Oh, thank goodness you've come. I take it you're the one who answered our petition.
Wait, aren't you...? You are! Forename, the adventurer who saved our star! Would that our meeting was under better circumstances.
I was conducting a routine inspection of the transporter here when I suddenly found myself surrounded.
You'll find more of the same across the chasmâ”€once-docile animals grown strangely aggressive. My colleagues there can tell you more.
If you'll give me just a moment, I can finish checking our equipment.
You really are famous.
And for good reason, as you'll soon see for yourself.
There. It should be safe to cross now.
Let's go!
Once you cross the chasm, my colleagues shouldn't be far.
Haha! Quite an interesting contraption you've got here!
Is that our petitioner? Let's go and have a chat.
