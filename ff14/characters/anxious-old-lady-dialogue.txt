Your Excellency...is there any word from Palaka's Stand?
My grandson was bound for there yesterday, and I-I worry for his life...
We are still awaiting a report. But I promise you, as soon as I have aught to share...
Y-Your Excellency! I bring grave news!
You are...?
I...I'm Matsya of Akyaali. A humble fisherman.
Ah, I remember you from our first visit.
Hm? Wait, you're...
B-But no, that can wait!
When the skies turned red, I set off for Palaka's Stand, fearing for the safety of a friend.
But as I drew near the village, I saw dreadful beasts all about.
No... Gods have mercy...
Your Excellency! Save my grandson! I beg of you!
We will spare no effort to save all we can. But you must remain calm─
Calm!? You tell me to be calm!? You saw those beasts! They tore our bravest warriors limb from limb!
What if we are too late? If they catch him─sink their fangs into him...
The fangs...the blood...the screams!
Get away from her. Now!
