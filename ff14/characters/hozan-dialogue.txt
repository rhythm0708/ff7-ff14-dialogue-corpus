Greetings. Alphinaud informed me that a Scion would be arriving to help with the preparations. I am honored to meet you, though shamed as well. A great warrior should not be tasked with such trivialities.
Aye, I knew from a glance what manner of woman you were. I too have some skill at arms, as do many of our people.
Pray forgive this trifle, but might I trouble you to help round up the children that have been given into my care?
They are most adept at staying hidden from my sight, but perhaps your keen eyes will succeed where I have failed.
You have my thanks, friend. Pray seek out my son Yozan. He can tell you more.
