Gah!
I was hoping to talk with your boss, but I suppose you three will have to do.
Wait... That's the Second Promise! What do you want with us!?
Think I'm scared of a fancy title? I'll take your royal ears as a trophy...as soon as I get free of these ropes!
I know your gang is behind my sister's abduction. Tell me where she is.
Eat 'paca shit, saltlover! You'll get not answers from us!
That's right! We don't serve you!
Do not play games with me. Where is Wuk Lamat!?
I am fast losing patience. Talk now or die. The choice is yours.
<gulp> W-We were hired to nab the Third Promise, that's all. We don't know where they took her...
Hired? By whom?
We weren't told that either. Only Wawkesa knows─he's the one who took the job.
Well, it seems we needed their leader, after all.
Once I've arranged for the Landsguard to take custody of these criminals, I'll call on Thancred and his tracking skills. But perhaps you could pursue Wawkesa in the meantime?
The bandit was running in an easterly direction. Should you locate him, I suggest you shadow him rather than force a confrontation─he might lead us to where Lamaty'i is being held.
Go after Wawkesa. I'll watch these miscreants until they can be taken into Landsguard custody.
I can't believe I didn't see it...
I knew that womanman looked familiar.
This job's more trouble than it's worth.
Who's there?You'll never catch me!
What was that?
This was meant to be easy...
What was that?
Huh!?
Damn nerves...
Should be safe enough now.
He said to meet him in front of the hideout...
Where's that damn Hoobigo?
Finally! My money─give it to me now. The Landsguard may be hunting us already!
