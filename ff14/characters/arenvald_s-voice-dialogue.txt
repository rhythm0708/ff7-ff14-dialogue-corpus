Oh, come on, you two─we might as well make it a race! Victory goes to the first adventurer to find the treasure! Godsspeed!
Forename─it's Alphinaud. We have searched the prison beneath the palace, and found a teleportation portal concealed by enchantments. The markings indicate it leads to an underground cavern.
What news on your end?
...And you believe it leads into the ruins? Then I daresay we will be able to meet within. Go on and head through the door.
By the way, I took the liberty of calling on a friend for help. I guarantee she's both dependable and discreet. We'll see you soon!
Good to see you found a way in too, Forename.
Right, then! Let's go and get our treasure!
Up for some spearfishing, J'moldva?
