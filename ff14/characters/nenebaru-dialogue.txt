Hail, adventurer! Might you have come at the behest of Miss Momodi of the Quicksand?
Excellent. Which brings us to the matter of the attunement feeâ”€that will be one hundred thousand gil, if you please, madam.
...AHAHAHAHAHA! Apologies, but I do so relish the opportunity to make that jest. The look on your face was absolutely priceless! Ah, but the fact that you were so easily deceived suggests to me that you are unfamiliar with the use of aetherytes. Allow me to explain.
These crystalline agglomerations tap into aetherial energies, and are primarily used as a means to travel swiftly from one place to another.
Perchance you have heard of Return and Teleport? Well, these transportation spells make direct use of the aetherytes and their connection to the flow of aether.
Given that there is an aetheryte in almost every corner of Eorzea, any adventurer with a mind to explore the realm will wish to seek out and attune herself to each and every one!
But even if you have no intention of wandering beyond the sultanate's borders, it would be prudent for you to attune yourself to any aetherytes you encounter from now on.
I pray you found that informative. Should you wish to learn more about aetherytes or transportation magic, I should be happy to answer your questions.
