Me? I'm a chef from Tuliyollal. I often come here to buy Gobli's mezcal─the finest in Tural, according to my customers.
He always brings out a jug during our dealings, but I can't handle the stuff too well myself...
I take small sips─not wanting to be impolite, you understand─but still end up so addled as to agree to whatever price he quotes me.
It would be nice to have less, uh, potent refreshments during such conversations. Else I might have to seriously reconsider our arrangement...
His spirits are excellent, I agree, but they're simply too strong for me...
