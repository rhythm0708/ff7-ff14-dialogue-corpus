Hello there, friend! Can you feel that? Love is in the air, just waiting to be snatched up by questing hands!
That means Valentione's Day is upon us once more, and I, Astrid de Valentione, and my fellow emissaries are here to support all who would avail themselves of this bounty!
You have the air of one in constant pursuit of adventure...and what greater adventure is there than to fall head over heels for another? Welcome, my friend, to the festival of ardor and affection!
Oh, but I know youâ”€Forename! Forgive me, I do get so caught up in my introduction. It is an absolute pleasure to see you again!
...Come to think of it, an intrepid adventurer like you might be just what I require. Might I ask a favor of you?
A fellow emissary by the name of Emilie departed earlier to prepare a little surprise for our festivities, you see, but she's been gone for quite some time. I would like you to make sure she hasn't gotten herself into trouble.
I would go myself or ask one of my associates to check up on her, but all are busy guiding our love-starved revelers. Will you do me this favor?
I am in your debt!
Before she left, Emilie said she would be practicing under the trees near Fen-Yll Fineries. No doubt you will find her there.
You shall find Emilie practicing under the trees near Fen-Yll Fineries. Pray go with all haste.
