Oh, hello there. What am I doing, you ask?
Look up the trunk. See the plants within capsules?
These are species that either can't survive in Windspath Gardens, or would become invasive and disrupt the ecosystem.
The capsules recreate the conditions they require, from tropical to frigid climes, while keeping them isolated.
In this way, any and all plant life can be preserved forever. Just like ourselves.
I've been observing the plants for decades now. They're like children to me.
