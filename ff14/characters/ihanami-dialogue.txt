You are the ones who came from above, yes? If we could have a moment of your time?
Mine apologies. I did not mean to startle you. My name is Ihanami, and this is my wife Yunagi.
We were wondering... Have you any news from Doma? If so, we should like very much to hear it.
May I ask why?
...If you must. Our daughter fought in the rebellion. We have heard naught from her since.
'Twould be too much to hope that you know of her, but...her name is Yugiri.
