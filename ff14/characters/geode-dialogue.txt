...Who?
I just had to get a look at you in the lightâ”€and I can still hardly believe my eyes! But it is you, my darling Elene'shpya.
My darling what now?
Oh, it's so good to see you, my fussy little bunbun. But what are you doing here? What brings you all this way?
Ahahaha!
Why the long face? Aren't you happy to see me after all this time?
I'd know that laugh anywhere... Mother?
Wait, wait, wait! Since when was your mother a weird...floating thing!?
And what have we here? Say, aren't you Gulool Ja Ja's kitten?
I knew I recognized that adorable fuzzy face! Elene'shpya was always sooo excited whenever you invited him over to play. You remember me, I hope?
I can't say that I do... But you knew my father?
Appearances notwithstanding, it would seem this is my mother, Cahciua.
I'm sorry...?
Oh, but this won't do! Come in, come in! Friends of my Elene'shpya are always welcome...
All I ask is a little forewarning, but no!
Just when I thought I was starting to get a handle on this place. How are things still getting stranger?
