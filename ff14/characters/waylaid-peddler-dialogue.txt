Was there something I could help you with...?
I'm told you were the victim of a bandit attack. Could you recount exactly what happened?
My goodness─I thought I recognized you! I'll tell you everything I remember, Second Promise!
It was that scoundrel Wawkesa who ambushed me.
You know the name of your attacker?
There's no mistaking that hair. All my peddler friends have stories of that notorious bandit leader and his predations.
Wawkesa and his gang will stoop to any low for the sake of a few pel. And with no fresh quarry coming up the broken stairs, they've had to become more creative.
Little wonder he went after Lamaty'i. He likely thinks to ransom her for a royal sum.
I expect he'll soon make his demands...but I don't intend to wait. We'll find this villain first, and deliver his deserved payment in person.
What say you to a small deception? I will assume the role of a well-to-do merchant to lure Wawkesa out of hiding. Then, when he comes sniffing about, we catch the rat by the tail.
An excellent plan! And I have just the right garments for your disguise─at a specially discounted price, of course!
A brush with bandits hasn't dampened your mercantile spirit, I see. Very well, I accept your generous deal.
Now we lay the bait.
I will precede you into Many Fires to make my presence known. You follow on behind, boasting to those along the way how you paid me a hefty purse in exchange for a rare gemstone or some such.
If Wawkesa is as coin-hungry as they say, then a recently enriched peddler should be an irresistible mark. We let him strike, and then we spring our trap.
I pray that your scheme is successful!
