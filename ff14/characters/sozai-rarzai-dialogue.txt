How am I supposed to work on an empty stomach? Go on, have a guess at what I had for breakfast.
Whaâ”€ Gods, how'd you know!? It's my breath, ain't it? It probably smells as wooden as the food tasted... But I know why you're here. <sigh> I'd just as soon get some real food in me, but I ain't one to reject a summons from the cap'n.
