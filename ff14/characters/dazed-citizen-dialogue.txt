Are you saying we were Vauthry's puppets all this time?
When you attacked us, you were not yourselves. That much is true.
But your conduct prior to that moment was your own. Vauthry's unnatural charisma does not absolve you of all responsibility.
Of your own free will, you came to this city and gave yourselves over to its pleasures.
And in the course of this, if you mistreated those less fortunate than you...then that too was of your own free will.
It is not for me to judge you, but for your victims. For history. For your conscience.
You have dreamed a twisted dream, but now you are awake.
You may yet share this world of ours. Join with us and each other that we might begin anew.
We've lost so many already. We dare not lose any more.
I have said my piece. My thanks for giving me the chance.
There is nothing more to be done here. Let us go after Vauthry.
