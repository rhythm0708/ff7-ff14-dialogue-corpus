Electors? Oh yes, I've heard all about the rite of succession!
They're looking to put a new ruler on the throne, eh? Personally, I'm rooting for Zoraal Ja.
If the First Promise wins, he'll look to expand our sphere of influence. That means access to more resources and more customersâ”€in the thousands column, potentially! So many new trading opportunities to spread happiness far and wide!
Others have been coming around to my way of thinking, so I've begun crafting goods inspired by the Resilient Son. Would you care to purchase something?
Very well. You said you wanted to know about the elector? I could help you...but I won't. I can tell you're no supporter of Zoraal Ja or his policies.
The First Promise will come here too, won't he? I'll have to give him a nudge in the right direction.
