Hm...? Wait. I know you. You were the one who saved us from those beasts back at the temple...
Were it not for you─well, let's not even think about that. At times like this, we mustn't dwell on what might've been, but look to the future...
But what future awaits us? How can Radz-at-Han hope to recover from this? Most of my friends are gone, and I don't know where to turn...
A cup of chai? Well, if you insist...
Ahhh...that aroma has a way of clearing the mind... Come to think of it, we've faced our fair share of trials in the past as well. And no matter how hard the times, we've always come together as a people united.
One day at a time, one step at a time─for that is all any of us can do. Yes... Back to work. Once I've finished this cup. Thank you.
First order of business is securing food and shelter. We also must contact our friends in the city and see how they fare. Hah, no rest for the weary!
