Ah. One of the newcomers. Welcome. I spoke with Lyse.
I bade her help the children gather fuel for the cookfires. I trust it will be a good experience for all.
For you too, perhaps. Seek them in the south, across the bridge.
Oh, Forename! Are you here to help too?
Great! So...I suppose Dorbei told you that the children and I are gathering “fuel” for the fires, did he?
It'll need to be dried before they can burn it, of course. You, um...you do understand what we're here for, right? Only, some people can be a bit squeamish about this sort of stuff.
Then again, you've never minded getting your hands dirty, have you? Anyway, we're trying to get four piles each. Good luck! And keep an eye on the children while you're at it, eh?
Well? Have you found your share yet?
Good work. I hope you took the time to talk to the children while you were at it.
