You're an odd-looking fellow, aren't you? Still...takes all sorts, I s'pose. This here's Vesper Bay─“Thanalan's door to the ocean,” as some folk like to call it...
Am I to understand from your answer that I have indeed arrived in Eorzea?
Eh? ...Yes. You're in Eorzea.
Ah, a plain response at last! And the one I wanted, at that! My journey was not without its hardships, and I would sooner travel by land than put to sea again!
You do not believe that so small a bark could bear me across the ocean? Such timid little sailors! I had but to set my course, then set my jaw till I made port!
Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!
Though...'twould perhaps have been wise to lay down my oars a moment to sup on more than the spray of brinewater. By the trembling of my limbs, I sense a brief repast may be in order...
Nay! I will not hearken to the feeble grumblings of an empty belly! Duty comes before all!
Good gods, man! Are you all right?
Thou art far indeed from home, friend...
Welcome, Warrior of Light. This way, if you please.
Dear friends...pray accept my heartfelt thanks for your efforts in defense of Gridania's borders. I would fain dwell longer on my gratitude for the support of the Alliance, but the situation at Baelsar's Wall demands that we forgo such pleasantries.
