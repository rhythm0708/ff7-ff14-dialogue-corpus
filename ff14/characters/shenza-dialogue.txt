Thank you! Thank you so much! I'm Shenza, by the way. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
If you would please step inside, I can introduce you to everyone!
Sorry for dragging you into this.
There they are!
That's them, the two volunteers.
Wawlika is our stationmaster, and over there is our top driver, Nitowikwe.
And this grizzled mug is Zawpya, an engineer who joined around the same time as me.
