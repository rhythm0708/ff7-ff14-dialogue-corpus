I can't leave now. What if those soldiers come back?
And what are those strange machines looming overhead? Gods, I have so many questions.
I see... It would put my mind at ease to learn something─anything─of the threat we face.
All right, then. I'll go to the Winged Walk.
Thank you. I feel better already, and likely better still once I hear what the Dawnservants have to say.
