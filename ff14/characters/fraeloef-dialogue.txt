You there. Adventurer. Cast your eyes towards the Brewer's Beacon. Does the light not seem uncommonly weak?
It cannot possibly be bright enough to guide the ships sailing in the bay. I would march over to the lighthouse and investigate myself, but I am duty-bound to remain at my post.
I would consider it a favor if you could make a visit to the Brewer's Beacon and see if aught has befallen Khanswys, the lighthouse keeper.
