The Satrap!
Thank the heavens!
My countrymen. I am relieved and heartened to see you strong and safe.
While the danger has not yet passed─far from it─allow me to assure you that the beasts that raged within the city walls have been exterminated to the last.
Outside this sanctuary, the brave men and women of the Radiant Host and our dragon ally continue to battle our unholy foes.
I pray these tidings put your minds at ease, and help you calm your hearts. Have faith that we shall soon conquer this terrible trial.
