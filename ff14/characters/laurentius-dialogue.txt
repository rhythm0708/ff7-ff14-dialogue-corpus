Can you not see I am on patrol? Be gone. If you have business with the Wailers, take it to the Barracks.
Not long now... Hmph. To think patrol routes and rations would fetch such a price...
No more than I deserve, though. 'Tis little wonder the Empire has risen to such heights. If only the Wailers paid men their worth...
Y-You! What did you─? How long have you─? Help. Help! Heeelp!
Please! Come quick, my friends! It is I, Laurentius! I am under attack!
How...? How did you...? You just... I-I know nothing! I was on patrol. He just appeared! I...I thought you were working for the Garleans!
How long do you mean to keep this up? What is it you imagine I've done? Enough! Enough, I say!
It's... It's over, then. Aye, I sold maps and rations to the Empire. It was I. I meant no harm. I only wanted the coin.
The Wailers are good. Strong. I was proud to join their ranks. Am proud. But... They do not provide. They preach justice, honor, duty. But in the end, it is those with money who do as they will. Who live as they will.
...So I sought an opportunity to change my fortunes, and took it. All I've done, I've done for money. Endangered myself, my home, everything and everyone I love... Why, my actions have put your life in danger, too...
...Though you do not yet realize how much. Heh heh heh! Bloody idiot─did you imagine that you had cornered me? It is not I who is cornered.
Garleans! I've brought the Miqo'te bitch!
Permit me a question, if you will. Are all adventurers so deluded as to believe they can challenge the power of Garlemald?
You would need a veritable mountain of gil to fund such an endeavor! Such is the cost of fighting great power. Or of making it. Or of remaking it, as we will Gridania.
