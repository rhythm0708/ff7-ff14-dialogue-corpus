Mlem mlem mlem... Leader...? No...
Sleepingway... My job is...is... Hmm. Perhaps I'd better ask...
Wh-What!? How in the─!?
When did you get here? Who let you in? Why wasn't I told!?
Leader? Ah, yes—ahem! Look no further—I am the one you seek.
Me? Oh, yes—of course! As the only one around here capable of doing anything properly, it falls to me to take charge of the others.
...What was that supposed to be? Your humming─if one can even call it that─is atrociously off-key! It should sound more like this!
As leader of the Loporrits, I cannot allow substandard attempts at musicality to go unremarked, even if you are a guest. But being the magnanimous sort that I am, I'll forgive you this once.
Well, well. Looks like you beat us here.
Your friends, I take it. Is this all of them?
A group comprised entirely of children? What must their parents be thinking?
This isn't a nursery, after all. Though perhaps we should build one. Or did we build one already?
No matter. You needn't worry your pretty little heads. All will be well, I promise.
But goodness me, we shouldn't be standing about gawping. I must take you to meet the others.
If you could run along back toward the entrance, you'll find a path that leads to the central platform on the upper floor.
There's no wrong way to reach it, but it's the large, glowing ball at the center, if you should find yourselves lost.
I shall gather the others and meet you there.
Well, then. Back to the upper floor it is.
'Tis astounding how the Loporrits─despite their diminutive stature─are able to maintain such gargantuan facilities.
Given their size, getting from one end of this place to the other must be exhausting. I honestly don't know how they do it.
The aetheric composition and density of this sphere is quite similar to the crystalline concepts we've seen before. It likely shares their capacity for storing memories and knowledge.
