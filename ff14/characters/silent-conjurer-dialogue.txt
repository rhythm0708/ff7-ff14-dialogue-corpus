You are the Lominsan envoy? Begging your pardons, sir, but might I inspect the missive you bear?
Verily, this is the seal of the Admiral of Limsa Lominsa. Please come with me.
So you are the Lominsan envoy.
And an adventurer besides. The realm owes much to you and yours.
On behalf of our fair nation, I bid you welcome.
Please.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Kan-E-Senna, Elder Seedseer of Gridania, and leader of the Order of the Twin Adder, our nation's Grand Company.
I understand you bear a message from the Admiral.
A remembrance service for the fallen of Carteneau...
To think that five years have already come and gone...
It seems like only yesterday that the Garlean Empire attempted to seize all that we hold dear.
Rising in resistance, the city-states of Eorzea formed the Grand Companies, and joined hands in alliance.
But unbeknown to us, the Garleans sought not to best us in battle, but moved instead to enact a terrible plot: the Meteor project, by which the lesser moon, Dalamud, would be torn down from the heavens to annihilate all life below.
In a desperate bid to save the realm from certain destruction, our forces marched for the Carteneau Flats, and there met the VIIth Imperial Legion.
More bloody a battle I have never seen, and would never wish to see again. Yet the carnage was but a prelude to the atrocity which followed.
For despite our best efforts, Dalamud continued its descent, and from it emerged the elder primal Bahamut, who proceeded to rain fire upon Eorzea.
The VIIth Imperial Legion was consumed in the blinking of an eye, while our own forces fared little better...
That any among us were spared defies explanation. All seemed sure to perish.
As the flames converged upon us, I prepared myself for death...only for a brilliant light to envelop me, relieving me of my senses.
When at last I awoke, Bahamut was gone, and the land, which had but moments before been aflame, now seemed to me a place unknown─not simply ruined...but changed.
Archon Louisoix may well have been able to shed light upon these mysteries, but he, like so many, never returned from Carteneau.
And so we were left with countless questions, and no prospect of an answer. Yet such matters did not long occupy our thoughts, for we had far graver concerns.
The Calamity, as the devastation wrought by Bahamut has come to be known, laid our nations nigh to waste, and to this day we struggle to rebuild our lives and homes.
To compound matters, the beast tribes continue to summon their primals, while the Empire encroaches upon our borders, consolidating its foothold in Eorzea. The outlook, in short, is bleak.
In the wake of the Calamity, it has been all each nation could do to nurse its own wounds.
Yet if we are to weather the coming storm, we must needs stand united once more. A remembrance service may well present an opportunity to rekindle the spirit of unity which first gave rise to the Alliance.
I wholeheartedly approve of the Admiral's proposal. The necessary provisions shall be made for a service here in Gridania.
You have done the people of Eorzea a fine service this day, and I would not put you to further trouble. I shall see that my reply reaches the Admiral anon.
You, meanwhile, are bound next for Ul'dah, are you not?
Please send the Flame General my regards. Ah, and if you would be so kind, I should appreciate it if you would inform him that a pet of mine has been ill behaved of late─my wolf, to be precise. Needless to say, he must be brought to heel, and I would very much welcome the General's counsel on how this might be achieved.
I thank you for coming. May the Twelve see you safe to Ul'dah and beyond.
