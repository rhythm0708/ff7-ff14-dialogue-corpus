Unnngh, can barely keep my eyes open... Time to call it a day...
<yawn> So drowsy... Not safe to work when drowsy... Better get some rest...
<yawn> All work and no ale makes...something a something. And I'm spent...
All the dwarves have taken their leave. Good work, my friend.
We have done all that we can. Let us await Korutt's return.

I daresay it will suffice for our purposes. You have our gratitude, Korutt.
Let us carry this back to...to...
