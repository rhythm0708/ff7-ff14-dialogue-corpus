Queen Sphene! To what do I owe this sudden shower of praise?
My apologies for the interruption. I am come with guests from beyond the barrier.
They wish to learn more of Alexandria, and so I invited them to see how our crops are grown. I do hope that's all right.
So the rumors of visitors from the outside were true!
What manner of hosts would we be to deny them a look around─and I gather Your Majesty also intended to check on things here?
You know me too well, Mahuwsa. I thought to seize this opportunity to see how the farmers fare, and perhaps pepper them with a few questions. Though I do so enjoy observing and taking part in the work, too.
'Twould appear we have her permission. So please, walk the grounds to your heart's content.
You go on ahead. I'll keep Sphene company.
Don't misunderstand─I'm not the suspicious type. But given our positions, it would make sense for us to go around together, wouldn't you say?
A fair point. But be sure not to let me out of your sight!
I shall remain under Wuk Lamat's watchful eye. Pray, come find us after you've seen your fill and spoken with the other farmhands.
My duties here are quite varied despite being merely a farmer. We all have to do our part if we're to prosper.
Finished already, are we? If so, I should very much like to hear what you think of our facilities.
It's a shame Koana's not here to see all these bizarre contraptions.
