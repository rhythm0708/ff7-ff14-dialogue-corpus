The Dalmascans aren't coming!? But we already have everything they ordered! What are we supposed to do with it?
I don't know, but yelling at me isn't going to help. All I know is that their plans have changed, and that's that.
Look, you must have known this might happen. The Empire is at war with itself, and the provinces are in chaos.
And then there's the tower sitting on our doorstep spitting out monstrosities.
The city has its defenses, but we've been afforded no protection out here. We can't blame foreigners for not wanting to take the risk.
Gah! But this will be an enormous loss!
All right, all right... Forget about the Dalmascans. Surely some ships are still coming?
We have fresh produce, handicrafts, medicinesâ”€all the perennial Hannish favorites.
Our consortium works closely with merchants and artisans to supply only the finest wares. Quality is guaranteed!
<sigh> I know all these things, Khalzahl, I do.
Which is why I regret to say I have nothing for you. All voyages have been canceled or indefinitely postponed.
And you are...?
Wait, you're a foreigner, are you not? A merchant!? Please tell me you're a merchant!
I see... That's a shame...
I'm sorry, but we're discussing important matters. If you need something, please talk to one of the others.
