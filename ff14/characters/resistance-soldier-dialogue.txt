C-Captain! It's...it's Gallien, sir! His wound's gone an' festered, an' he's burnin' up! I don't think he's got much time!
Godsdammit! I asked the villagers for aid─got on my knees and begged─but they refused to lift a finger! If Gallien dies, his blood is on their hands!
These Quarrymill cravens would turn a blind eye to our plight, but they might listen to Albreda. I fear my anger will prevent me from rightly convincing anyone at the moment. I realize we scarce know each other, but this is a matter of life and death. Please, adventurer, go to her and try!
One of Meffrid's in bad shape, you say? I'm...I'm sorry, but there's naught I can do.
I want to help, truly I do─they're my countrymen, after all─but that'd mean going against the elementals' will.
I've been at Quarrymill long enough to know how right terrible the beings can be. I couldn't forgive myself if everyone gets banished because of me.
If there's anyone who can help you, it'd be Charline, the hamlet's resident Hearer. If you take the matter to her, might be as she'll listen...though I wouldn't get my hopes up.
