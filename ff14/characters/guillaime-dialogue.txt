Pardon the intrusion, Forlemort. I wished to speak with you regarding the recentâ”€ Oh, I did not realize you had a guest.
Inquisitor Guillaime! Y-You honor us with your presence, sir. The lady was just leaving.
Ahhh, you must be the one who rescued House Durendaire's knight from those heretics. Doubtless they feel indebted to you. I am told you seek an airship last seen in Coerthas five years ago, yes?
You come to us at an inconvenient time, I fear. Much has changed in the intervening years, and little for the better. While I wish you the best of luck in your search, I would also strongly advise caution.
The snows can come quickly in Coerthas. One moment you may feel as though you have a firm grasp on your surroundings, safe and secure in your knowledge, and the next you may find yourself in a wholly unfamiliar situation, blind to the dangers hidden by the blizzard. It would be wise for you to focus on a single landmark whilst traveling. Do not give in to temptation and deviate from your course.
I was not aware you aided House Durendaire in that fashion. Thank you, madam. Nevertheless, my decision stands. I cannot give you what you seek.
