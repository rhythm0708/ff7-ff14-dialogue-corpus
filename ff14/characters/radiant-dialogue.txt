Gods save us!
What is happening to their aether!?
All hope is lost... Gaaah!
Master Vrtra... They're everywhere!
My friends, heed meâ”€ These are children of Thavnair!
Forgive me... I could do them no harm.
This can't be happening!
Th-Thank you!
Ahhh!
Fall back!
If this is the only way...
...I shall silence the beasts of the air. Pray continue onward!
Leave the jungle to us.
It's too late...too late for us all...
We will grant you peace.
