W-We're just trying to find someoneâ”€the Dawnservant's elector. Could you tell us where they are?

Up there!

Not as you know him. What you see is an arcane manifestation of the Dawnservant as he was in his prime.
The channeler is Zereel Ja, Autarch of Mamook and elector for the Feat of the Brotherhood.
