Thanks for coming, friend. 'Tis no ordinary outsider who can gain the trust of the old bear. That's why I wanted to meet you, to discuss something in private.
Tell me...why are you snooping about? Did the Empire send you? Or someone else?
Coeurl got your tongue? Hmph, no matter. Whoever it is you work for, your meddling ends here. Get her!
Y-You're stronger than you look...
This changes nothing! Threaten us, beat us bloody all you like...but nothing short of death can make us give up our fight!
We're going to obtain the power to bring down the Empire, and with it we'll reclaim our homeland!
Attacked by Wilred and his cronies!? That they would go to such lengths for the sake of this plan of theirs...
Left to their own devices, the young fools are like to harm others, if not themselves. We must uncover their agenda and put an end to this madness.
Wilred mentioned obtaining the power to bring down the Empire. Of what power could he be speaking...?
