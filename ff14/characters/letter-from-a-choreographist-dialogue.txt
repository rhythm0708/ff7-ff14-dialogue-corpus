As a choreographist, my job is to create movements that convey specific emotions, such as a dancer's performance or a mammet's adorable gesture.
And though I have the honor of contributing my expertise to etiquette manuals, movement cannot be tangibly preserved in the manner that artwork such as paintings can. From the mesmerizing flutter of fabric to the inviting springiness of buuz, it all passes by in an instant.
In light of this, if but one of my steps or flourishes occupy a place in your memory, then nothing would make me happier.Movingly yours,A Humble Choreographist
