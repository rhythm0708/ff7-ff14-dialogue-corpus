Pitiful children of man! By my breath I claim you!
Arise once more as my loyal minions! Feed my flames with your faith, and all who stand against us shall burn!
O mighty Ifrit...
My one true god...
Your words are my bread...
Impossible! By what sorcery do you resist my master's will!?
Could it be...?
Your soul already belongs to another!? Yes, that is the only explanation!
Forsooth, thy frail mortal frame can serve as vessel to the blessing of but One.
Yet I smell not the taint of another upon thee...
The truth of thine allegiance waxeth clearâ”€thou art of the godless blessed's number.
The Paragons warned of thine abhorrent kind. Thine existence is not to be suffered.
My flames shall consume thy flesh and soul both!
