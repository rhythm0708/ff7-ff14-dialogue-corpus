...Ahem. Rather, I see tidings of my humble performance have reached even your ears, good madamsir! Please, honor me with your presence as my guest of honor.
Without further ado, I shall summon a foul, fell beast before your very eyes! I only hope you've brought a change of smallclothes.
A monster? It'll take more than a magician's cantrip to scare me...
Look here, my dear thrill seekers. Here lies an ordinary pumpkinâ”€or is it? Take care not to blink, for any moment of distraction may well be your last...
