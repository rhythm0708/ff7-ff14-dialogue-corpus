Quickly, take shelter in the castle!
I daresay we are come to a different time.
The painful memories of war, I lay to rest...
Everything is in ruins...
This is the culmination of the Storm Surge...
I can't make it... I can't take another step...
Don't give up! We're almost to the castle!
L-Lighting... S-So much lightning...
Foreign entities detected. Proceeding with removal.
Is anyone still out here?
Help! Please help my family!
They're over there!
This feels so real, it hurts not to help them...
I know... I need to remind myself it's only a memory...
There are people over there! Bring us closer!
Th-The princess herself came for us?
Her Highness is here! We're going to be fine!
<gasp> L-Lightning!
Oh no...
It's too dangerous! You must flee!
The airships are in trouble!
The airship barrier won't be enough!
Twelve have mercy...
Don't worry about me! Just save yourself!
May we meet again, Your Highness!
Security breach confirmed. Initiating level five security protocol.
It matters not what bars our way!
We'll brush them all aside!
We'll brush them all aside!
It's split into pieces!
It's definitely up to something!
It's definitely up to something!
It's definitely up to something!
It's definitely up to something!
Beware the spheres yonder!
It changes tactics by rearranging itself!
It changes tactics by rearranging itself!
It changes tactics by rearranging itself!
It changes tactics by rearranging itself!
And that's that!
Another obstacle out of the way.
Fear not. You will all live on.
Are we in a different time again?
It appears to be the same place...
And at the last, my final...<bzzzt>...an Endless...
It used to be dangerous out here, right?
Aye. Thankfully, the barrier protects us from lightning these days.
Without it, there's no way we could come salvaging like this.
Ah, another beautiful day beneath Everkeep's barrier.
Foreign enti...detected. Initiating...rity protocol.
What does the future hold for us...?
They've done it! They've preserved the queen's...
Huh? Something seems off...
Are the memories breaking down?
We can't give up! Not until...keep...complete...
Did you hear the rumors about the queen?
You mean that her memories were preserved?
Foreign entities...prior to comp...memory erasure.
The system itself may have become unstable.
It's not because of us, is it?
From her memories, she will be reborn to lead us always.
Out eternal queen... This is a new dawn for the realm.
We're coming, Sphene!
