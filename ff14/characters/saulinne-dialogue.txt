Hello! My name is Saulinne. It's nice to meet you, missmister.
As I told Miss Garanjy, I've seen a boy around here who...
...Oh! Look, there he is! Over there!
...I guess he didn't come to play this time either.
That boy's been watching the stage from a distance ever since preparations began.
At first, I thought he must be excited about the Starlight Celebration, but he always looks so sad! That's why I thought I'd try inviting him to play...
But when I called out to him, he just ran away.
Comforting others when they are troubled is a very kind thing to do. You did well to try, Saulinne.
I just think nobody should be alone during the Starlight Celebration!
He keeps coming back, so I'm sure there's something he's worried about. Maybe he's too shy to ask for a present...?
Either way, I'm worried about him. Would you help me make sure he's okay, missmister?
Then I'll leave this matter in your capable hands. I believe the boy ran off towards the Whistling Miller. Perhaps someone there knows more about him.
Let's ask around! Please tell me if you learn anything, and I'll be sure to do the same.
I believe he headed for the Whistling Miller. Perhaps someone saw him run by?
I haven't found him yet, but I'll keep asking. Tell me if you learn anything!
