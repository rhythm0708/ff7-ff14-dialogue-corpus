You have business with me, adventurer?
Roseline is right to be cautious. For this stranger to venture so close, yet go to such great lengths to remain undetected, is highly suspicious. They clearly have designs on Bentbranch.
We appreciate the help. I should write my name here, yes?
And...here, take it. You'll find Eylgar in the stables, past the aetheryte.
