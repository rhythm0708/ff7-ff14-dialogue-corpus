Beyond that distant veil... Paradise lost. So glorious. So beautiful...
We were a proud and noble race. Strength embodied. We knew only love. Before they came...
Metal monstrosities of black and silver. No bonds of blood did they share, nor conviction did they have to guide them.
A crushing defeat. Never had we known such shame... Stilled now are the winds, though none could fill these wings burdened by ignominy. We fly no more, only sink into oblivion...
I beg thee leave me to dream. To forget that which we have lost...
