Sisters have mercy, what is happening to the world!? What am I to do...? Is nowhere safe!?
Settle down, friend. The danger has passed...at least for now. If it's not too painful to remember, could you tell us what you saw?
F-First I heard the screams...then a horde of ravening beasts came charging towards us!
One of them was huge─bigger than a marid! Throwing people about like rag dolls...and it was eating them!
I hid. Under the counter. Saw others do the same.
But the shrieking and wailing kept getting louder...more voices in the throng. Beasts or victims, I couldn't tell─I knew not what was happening. I still don't...
That is enough, my good man. You were brave to share with us your tale. Many of your fellow merchants are safe. The High Crucible, too, has survived mostly unscathed. Pray stay close to your friends and loved ones, and rest your body and mind while you are able.
I suspect that is the most we can expect the people here to tell us. I think it best we find a place outside the bazaar where we might rest and review our findings.
What nightmare is this... When will it end?
