All right─ye know the rules! First one to smash their boulder will be judged the goobbue slayer!
An' don't even think about tryin' to kill me! That's cheatin'!
Who picked these boulders!? They're nothing alike!Ah, the hells with it─let the contest begin!
How ye doin', lass? Feelin' a bit stiff, by any chance?
Y-Yer still at it!? Bugger me─'tis lucky I've got one of these!
Heh heh...only killin's against the rules!
All right, all right, I admit it! I lied about bein' in the Company of Heroes. But I'm beggin' ye, chief─please don't dismiss me! I've learned me lesson, honest I have!
Save your blubbering, Trachtoum. <sigh> Gods, I should've known...
Mercy, please! I didn't want to deceive ye, I swear! It's just that I kept gettin' turned away by all the folk I asked for work, an' I panicked!
See, the last job I had was at Costa del Sol, an' there was this grizzled marauder everyone treated like royalty. When I heard he was a captain in the Company of Heroes, I finally understood why.
I-I wasn't bein' serious when I said I was one of 'em! But ye went an' believed me, so I...so I, er...
L-Look─his name was Wheiskaet, all right!? Wheiskaet! He'll tell ye how to defeat Titus or whatever the hells that thing's name is!
That's what ye wanted, ain't it!? So come on, then! Tell the chief to forgive me! It's only fair!
