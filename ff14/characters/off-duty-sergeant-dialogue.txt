An All Saints' Wake performance? Very well, but I face slavering monsters almost daily, so it will take something quite fantastic to make me flinch.
Oh, I could make him flinch so hard his heart would burst in his chest...! <sigh> But that's neither here nor there. What type of ghoul would be suitable?

Well, if you say so. Allow me to oblige!
Egads!
That...that gave me quite a fright. I only hope I never face such a monstrosity on one of my patrols, else my final act might be to soil my breeches. Well played, well played.
This looks almost real... I believe I might see this terrifying visage in my nightmares for some time yet.
