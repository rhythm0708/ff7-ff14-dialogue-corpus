Recently, my fellows and I have been taking ourselves around the realm, repairing buildings and roads as well as restoring natural landscapes.
This we do as part of an initiative to improve quality of life for adventurers.
Yours is a long journey; what little we can do to ease your way, we gladly do.Constructively yours,A Humble Architect
