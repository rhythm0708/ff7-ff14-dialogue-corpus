Maybe being liked isn't so bad after all!
I'm scared, but I can't look away...
I know what you mean...
What a fantastic yarn! Monsters plotting against monsters, all to make us happy?
I admit I find your story hard to swallow, but I also see no reason why a fellow guild member would lie... Very well, I shall take your tale at face value and consider these to be glad tidings indeed.
However, I cannot help but wonder if this was all an elaborate ruse. They knew we were watching them, and that may have compelled them to put on a show of charity.
After all, a monster cannot change its skin overnight. I shall continue to keep a close eye on their activities from afar. I thank you for everything you've done, and hope against hope that the evil has been laid to rest.
