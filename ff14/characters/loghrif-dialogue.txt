The heavens are ablaze and the land rent asunder. What will become of the world? Is life itself to be denied?
Come what may, we must not surrender to despair. If we but hold fast to hope, we may yet find a path to salvation.

Everything burns. Crumbles. Decays. I hear the lamentations of my brethren. And soon there will be only silence.
We will deliver our star from its doom, this we swear. So please, dry your tears.

We will deliver our star from its doom, this we swear. So please, dry your tears.
The time is come. We shall rewrite the laws of creation. And we shall save our star.
From this life, our savior born... May I be worthy of the honor.
I feel my soul turning. Slowly but irrevocably. And the power I wield begins to seem terrible... But this is right. It is right.

Though salvation is ours, it came at great sacrifice. All that remains is to pray...
To pray that we will one day meet again, beneath a blue sky.
To pray that we will one day meet again, beneath a blue sky.

Gone is the brilliant radiance of life, replaced by the sickly glow of malformed creatures.
Is this to be how it ends? For we who loved the star with all our being?
No. I will not suffer it to be so.
Well, well. We meet again, my new old friend.
