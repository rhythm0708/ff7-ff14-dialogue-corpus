Are you all right, sir? Our scouts reported the attack on your craft. We've come to rescue you.
Forename Surname, yes? Glad to have you with us.
I have not seen a craft of this design before... That traitor Garlond has been busy.
The secrets of magitek are ours by right. They are not to be squandered upon the savages of this land.
We are taking this craft back to the fortress! Dismantle it if you must! And bring the engineer! Someone must pay for Garlond's crimes.
They mean to take the ship back to Castrum Meridianum, along with your friend.
Wedge! You have to help him! That fool of a Lalafell was hiding inside the Tiny Bronco!
Nice-looking ship—though not the best place to have taken shelter, I agree.
It's the first airship we've built since the Calamity─the first since Master Garlond...well, since he went missing.
After years of work, she was finally ready for her first test flight. And she was soaring, she really was─till those bastards blasted her out of the sky!
We attack on my command. Kill them quickly, and save the Lalafell if possible.
Is that clear, Forename?
Show them what becomes of those who play with fire! Charge!
We're under attack! To arms!
