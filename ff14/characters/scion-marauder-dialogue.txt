Something feels wrong about this place...
Fear not─I will deal with its poison.
Darkness...
Hahahaha...
The mighty slayer of Ifrit comes now to me.
...With a countenance that bespeaks understanding.
An intriguing power, the Echo. I must needs choose my words with care.
Mayhap I might if I deign to speak in my guest's crude tongue. We meet at last.
I am Lahabrea of the Ascians, servant to the one true god.
Yours is a most fantastical tale. Truly absorbing.
It is a tale to tell Eorzea's children before bedtime. And it will soon be dark, Bringer of Light.
...The Dark Minions...
All that stands between this world and Darkness is an irksome anomaly in the aether─the Echo.
Yes...yours is a most fascinating tale.
Alas, like all good tales, it must needs come to an end. But fear not...
Hear.. Feel... The presence... of evil...
For the end of your tale is but the beginning of another... The tale of the Crystal's demise!
That tail looks like trouble.
