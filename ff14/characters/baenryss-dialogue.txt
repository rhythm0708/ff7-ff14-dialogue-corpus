Piss on that! We ain't turnin' back empty-handed!
Remember, no killin' the smallfolk, or it'll be your blood what stains Lord Leviathan's altars!
The Yellowbellies ye can butcher at will! Them dirt-eatin' slugs'll be crushed under the full might o' the Serpent Reavers!
Seems Swiftperch was the main target after all, eh?
Squads One and Two, protect the townsfolk! Squad Three, you're our rear guard!
The rest of youâ”€we meet their charge where we stand! Let us bear the commodore word of our victory, or no word at all!
