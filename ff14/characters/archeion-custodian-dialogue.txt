Peruse? You are clearly not gleaners, then. Might I ask your affiliation?
We belong to the Students of Baldesion, but...is that relevant? I was given to believe that the vaults─those open to the public, at least─were...open to the public.
Ordinarily, yes, that would be the case. At present, however, access is restricted. Only persons directly involved in the reorganization efforts are permitted to enter.
Not us, then. I suppose we had better move along to another facility.
This building has a lift which connects to the middle tier, yes? Might we at least make use of that?
That service has also been suspended, I am afraid. For the time being, priority has been given over to the conveyance of inventory.
What, so this is as far as we can go!?
I apologize for the inconvenience. Please come again after our restructuring operation is concluded.
By that time, it will be too late. And we were so close to getting answers...
We need to rethink our approach. Let us step outside for the moment, shall we?
...Students of Baldesion. Hmph.
The Forum must be wary of exposure indeed to so heavily restrict the use of public institutions...
If they're going to close off facilities, then they ought to announce it! The students must be furious!
Labyrinthos is constructed in the shape of a mortar. This upper layer is called the “Outer Circuit,” and the “Medial Circuit” lies one tier below us...
We are at an impasse. As we have no other leads, I should like to pursue this one further...
But I doubt that our stone-faced custodian will be swayed by heartfelt pleas. We must seek another means to access the lower levels.
'Tis likely that the people in this area are involved in the restructuring in one way or another. If we were to ingratiate ourselves, they might allow us to accompany them on the lift.
Let us ask around. Surely someone is in need of a few strong backs to lighten the load.
