Nothing that passes through those gates escapes my notice!
I saw the rouser and his rabble set out for Woad Whisper Canyon not long ago, singing about drinking themselves stupider. Cheeky sods said I should join them!
I told them I'd rather shrivel up than sip whatever it was that had pickled their brains. If you find the idle swine, be sure and give them a cuff 'round the ear from me, will you?
Of all the dirty, deceitful, downright dastardly deeds that slippery bastard's done!
Claimin' to take the lads out for a drink, only to lead us straight into a bloody trap! It don't get no lower than that!
'Course, I've learned to stay a step ahead of ol' Sevrin, so I was readyâ”€but the others weren't so lucky. You've got to help 'em!
My axe may as well've been a white flag for all the good it did... Hope you fare better, or the sorry bastards in there are done for.
Sevrin might've got us into this mess, but I ain't about to let him give his life for us. I'd sooner bow to a fishback than be in that connivin' bastard's debt! To arms!
