Overdweller...art thou deaf to their weeping?
Thy vile kind coveteth ever the blessing of the land and murdereth my children by the score─all in service to greed. Such sins are beyond pardon.
Ah...but I am not the first to suffer thy defiance. Thou didst bring Ifrit low.
Godless overdweller! Thy myriad heresies shall not go unpunished! Upon thee shall I wreak a terrible vengeance!
Sons of man! Murderers of my children!
Time to bring low the mountain.
I shall grind thee beneath my heel, mortal!
I shall grind thee beneath my heel, mortal!
For thee my hatred is unending, unyielding!
Careful─this isn't over yet!
Tremble before the might of the earth!
To the last, I grapple with thee!
Hie, my children, into the dark! She will not be denied...
The Lord of Crags, Great Father Titan has fallen!
The crimes of the overdwellers shall never be forgiven! Never be forgotten! No, no, never!
'Twas your kin who broke the covenant! We have acted only in defense of our lands!
Cease your aggression, or never will there be peace! Until our dying breaths, we shall defy you─deny, decry, defy!
Now these are the readings one would expect of an eikon...
I have seen enough. We proceed as planned.
