Welcome, traveler. Can I interest you in some rice wine? Exceptional quality, delivered but the other day...
Welcome, traveler. Can I interest you in some rice wine? Exceptional quality, delivered but the other day...
...Ah. An Auri shinobi and a Roegadyn samurai. If I may, I would answer your question with some few of mine own.
If I speak of that which you know, ijin, be not offended. You are familiar with the situation in the lands across the Ruby Sea? The doomed rebellion, after two and a half decades of quiet?
I see. And you are familiar with the ways of Hingashi? How we elect to stand apart and support no cause but our own? Indifferent and callous, some may call us, but pragmatism is essential if a humble island nation such as ours is to survive.
But we are not fools. Complete isolation is impractical. And so Kugane is open to ijin, and we are equally hospitable to all. Or, if I must speak more plainly: Yes, I can help you. But if I do, I must also oblige the ones who ask after you.
Are you willing to accept this fair and equitable treatment?
If anyone comes looking for us, tell them whatever you like.
As you wish. The two individuals of whom you speak did indeed come here. They sought passage across the Ruby Sea.
Few ships are willing to make the trip at the moment. Nevertheless, I made several introductions on their behalf. That was the extent of our interaction.
I will provide you with the names of the captains, if you like.
You've been a great help, Mistress Kotokaze. I'll be sure to come back for that wine sometime.
We would welcome your custom, miss.
We should question these captains as soon as we can. You take the first three, I'll take the rest, and we'll meet here when we've finished. All right? Good luck!
