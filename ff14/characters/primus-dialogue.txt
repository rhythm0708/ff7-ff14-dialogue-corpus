Jullus has told us all. You have Lord Gnaeus's permission to enter and speak with our residents, but not to petition them directly for support. Remember that.
Their defenses bespeak a cautious mindset. More so than Tertium.
Here it isâ”€Senatus. A temporary refuge for political dignitaries, hence the tight security.
I am given to understand that outsiders are not normally permitted so much as a glimpse inside. We should consider ourselves fortunate to be given this opportunity.
I hope it will be worth the trouble.
As do I, Zero. As do I...
The basic design is reminiscent of Tertium, though somewhat...embellished.
To begin, I propose we split up and ask the residents for their views on the Ilsabard contingent and the current state of affairs.
We would also do well to learn more about this enclave itself. Should you observe anything of note, pray keep it in mind.
It is through open hearts and open minds that I believe we may yet convince their leaders to work with us for the greater good.
The furnishings are quite lavish. I am reminded of Troia...
Please, I wish to hear your concerns regarding the tower.
