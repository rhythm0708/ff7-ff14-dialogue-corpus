Hm? Yes, you have the pleasure of speaking with Mogmug. I know, I know, I am the fluffiest, most enchanting creature you have ever laid eyes upon, kupo.
It isn't easy being this adorable! I can barely take a stroll outside without those relentless Dravanians throwing themselves at me... Why, they look as if they might just gobble me right up!
In any case, fleeing their overbearing adulation is growing a bit tiresome. Your trial, madam, is this: find these ardent archaeosaurs, and slap some manners into them, kupo.
Perhaps a firm smack on the snout will teach them to appreciate my charm from afar!
You were able to humble my Dravanian devotees? Wonderful! You are as capable as I am captivating, kupo!
Still, my precious perfection does not excuse those louts from pursuing me so mercilessly, their tongues lolling and bellies rumbling!
The Dravanians and their ilk have much to learn about acceptable acts of admiration!
