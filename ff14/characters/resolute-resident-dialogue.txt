By the gods... I had just resolved to salve my soul with the sight of adorable creatures this year, and what should appear but the most charming of chocobo chicks! What's your name, little one, and what is that winsome outfit you're wearing?
You have a keen eye, sir. This little fellow is Ryunosuke, and he is dressed as a ryuâ”€a dragon of the Far East. By thus attiring Eorzea's favorite beast of burden, we hoped to create a symbol of friendship between our lands.
Well now, that this adorable form should harbor such splendid symbolism! I'd never heard of this ryu before, but now I'm keen to know more!
In that case, sir, I invite you to seek us out at the Aftcastle anon. There, we will be glad to answer all your questions.
Excellent, we shall head there at once!
Oh, what a relief to see the locals take an interest in the ryu! I daresay we have gathered enough people, so let us head back to the Aftcastle.
