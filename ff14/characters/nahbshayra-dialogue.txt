Look at them all, lazing about! Knowing full well the beasts might strike again at any moment! Do they not realize their lives are in danger!?
Well, I, for one, intend to survive! I'm too young to die! Yes, I'll leave this island behind if I must!
But...but where would I go? Is anywhere safe these days!?
A cup of chai? Can't you see I have more important things to worry about!?
No...no, you're right. It is precisely in times like these that we must strive to remain calm and steady.
I do believe I'll visit the elder and see what needs to be done. If there is any way I can aid my village and my friends, I will do it.
Ahhh...how the warmth of the chai spreads through all my limbs... I can't remember the last time I've breathed so easily.
