Opening a shop in Tuliyollal has always been a dream of mine. I'm honored to be part of Bayside Bevy's bustling trade!
Tuliyollal is safe in no small part due to your valor. As a token of our appreciation, I have commissioned special equipment for you.
While it is inadequate as an expression of gratitude, I pray it will serve you well in your coming mission.
It apparently incorporates foreign technology. Leave it to Koana to request such a thing, eh?
Mewazunte yonder has the equipment in his keeping. Just say the word, and he will bring it out.
These arms and armor are the work of our finest artisans. I can vouch for their quality and functionality both.
I'll bet it looks good on you!
With your shiny new gear, I reckon you're ready for anything!
Come, let's head to the Skydeep Cenote!
Access to the area is presently restricted per my orders, so I shall accompany you.
And here we are again...
It feels like a lifetime ago that we were last here.
The city of gold. Where it all began...
This place is a little scary... I don't know if I could come here alone.
Koana has already gone inside, but I couldn't help but take a moment. Just being here takes me back.
And it wasn't even that long ago that we visited for the rite. So much has happened since then.
Truly. Guided by my grandfather's letter, I crossed the seas in search of answers...
What awaits us on the road ahead, I know not. But I shall walk it to the end with you all.
...Come on, let's go.
Electrope everywhere one turns, harboring vast amounts of lightning... This place is very much alive.
Krile, try holding your earring to the terminal.
No luck...
Don't give up yet. The terminal reads the code─it might just need higher clearance.
Gulool Ja, would you give it a try?
Me?
If the king's authority has passed to you, then the gate ought to open.
But I leave behind that which I've gained by the sweat of my brow... It is yours to embrace...or spurn...
Uwaaah!
The earring... It really was...
Remarkable... A voidgate is forced open with a blast of aether, and thus appears as a tear in the fabric of reality.
In contrast, this is the stitchwork of a master. Neatly hemmed, without a thread out of place. A power to be reckoned with...
But now isn't the time to marvel. If Gulool Ja can open the gate, then so too can Sphene close it.
'Twould be wise to employ magicks in its defense─both to maintain its stability and ward off interference.
While I am able to invoke said magicks, I cannot sustain them alone. I require another to channel with me, and in unison.
For that role I do humbly volunteer myself, but even our combined efforts offer no certainty of success. Might we prevail upon the two of you to lend your support?
Of course. If coordination between mages is required, few would be better suited than Alisaie and myself.
Shall I remain as well?
While your presence would be welcome, I'd rather you joined the expedition team.
For despite our earnest efforts, the gate may well end up closed once more.
In such a situation, it may fall to those on the other side to devise a method to reconnect our worlds. A task with which you are not unfamiliar, as I recall?
I have faith it will not come to that, but should it, I will endeavor not to disappoint.
So, assuming Wuk Lamat, Krile, and Erenville are a given for this foray...
I'll make myself useful here by guarding those who are maintaining the gate.
Should any threats emerge, from the world beyond or otherwise, I'll deal with them.
As will I.
Which leaves you free to head in there─and do what you do best.
It's fine. Really. Mostly.
Just don't let herhim bear the burden alone, do you hear?
I'm needed here, I accept that. I'm not a child anymore.
I'll spare no effort doing my part, so you do yours too. Together, we'll protect what we hold dear!
We who shall remain want for neither expertise nor experience. Worry not on our account, and fix thy gaze upon the path ahead.
En route here, I caught sight of a large lizard. It looked palatable enough, so I shall hunt it later.
We can enjoy the meat while you regale me with tales of the world beyond after you've returned.
To be completely honest, it is all I can do not to throw myself into that light.
But I must resist the urge, for my presence will be required here should the gate close. It wouldn't do to lose everyone, our champion not least of all.
I would dearly love to accompany you. But this time I will content myself with seeing you off.
Where you now go, I pray you find hope. I look forward to hearing your account upon your return.
I'll keep everyone safe. Just concentrate on your own task.
Once again I must leave Lamaty'i in your care. Please return safely.
I've done all I can. If you should meet Cahciua...please tell her I said thank you.
This power I've inherited, I'll use for good. I will!
There's no telling what dangers we'll face, I know. But if my mother is out there, I need to find her. And give her a piece of my mind...
If Sphene is intent on plundering aether from other worlds, then our task is clear: we must stop her.
She cannot be allowed to harm anyone else. Neither those who are dear to us, nor strangers we have never met.
Twenty years ago I emerged from that gate. Whether or not the answers I seek lie on other side, I will see things through.
I would be lying if I said I'm not nervous, but your presence gives me comfort and courage. I imagine your other travel companions often feel the same.
'Tis done. Whenever you're ready.
We'll protect the portal. Keep it open no matter what.
Beyond lies an unknown reflection.
Short of asking an Ascian, we unfortunately have no way of identifying which one it is.
Well, what we do know is that it's Sphene's domain─a place where she brings back those who've been lost. So for now, why don't we call it...
The unlost world!
Right, let's go!
How to describe the sheer amazement we felt when we emerged on the other side of the portal? I fear words do not do it justice.
Before us was a vibrant world where the memories of the departed abided and reveled in bygone days.
Living Memory, or so the Endless called it.
How they laughed and smiled as they reminisced upon unfulfilled dreams. Alive in all perceivable ways...yet knowing no loss.
So resplendent was every ilm of this paradise, the words rose unbidden to my lips:
All this time, it was here─the city of gold.
Neither the void nor the First... We are indeed come to an unknown reflection.
The “city of gold” is an apt description indeed...
This is my world. My home...
Amazing! Absolutely amazing!
We've literally stepped into the Yok Huy legend!
Whichever reflection this may be, 'twould seem the barrier between here and the Source is thin in Yak T'el.
That would explain the Yok Huy's visions and the location of the gate.
Hey, Erenville. That volcano over there─you don't suppose it's real, is it?
An actual volcano, spewing forth lava, in the middle of a city? I'd like to see that.
H-Hey, you never know!
Look, there's a path down. Let's see where it goes.
I see electrope is used here too.
There's no mistaking the design of this aetheryte.
The people here. Could they be...?
It's strange... Though I've never been to this place before, it somehow makes me feel nostalgic.
Unlike Everkeep with all its advanced technology, here it's brick and stone. It's like we've traveled to the past.
The differences may be more superficial than you think. Take a good look at the buildings around us.
There's electrope everywhere, along with myriad contraptions.
Like how Sphene projects her image onto soldiers, I believe this city's appearance is artificial.
This aetheryte is identical to the one in Everkeep, is it not?
This suggests that this place is Alexandrian.
That would seem a fair assumption. In light of all this, could it be this city is Everkeep's missing twelfth level?
