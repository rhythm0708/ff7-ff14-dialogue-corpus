Warriors of the Mol! You will go no further!
That didn't take long. Weapons!
I will deal with this rabble, my lord! Make for the ovoo!
My thanks, Gosetsu! Forward, brothers and sisters!
Gosetsu had the right idea!I'll keep them busy─the rest of you, keep moving!
Thank you, Lyse! With me, Hien, Forename!
There it is! The ovoo! We are not too late!
The fighting is most fierce! No matter─charge!
They falter! Now, Forename─claim the ovoo!
