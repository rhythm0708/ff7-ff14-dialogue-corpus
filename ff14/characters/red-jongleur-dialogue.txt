Greetings to our hopeful petitioners, one and all! Eulmore extends its warmest regards!
Let it be known that a lady of distinction wishes to dine on fish divine!
We seek a master culinarian who can guarantee seafood perfection! Dazzle the matron with your delicious dishes, and life in the city will be yours to enjoy. Even on days when fish is not on the menu!
Who among you will answer the call? Name yourself or another, we mind not at all!
Do you recall how I said Eulmore was a center of power and authority? Well, that is not the only reason for its fame.
It is also known as the “city of final pleasures.” The noble and the wealthy who survived the Flood gathered here to live out the rest of their days in decadent abandon.
A poor man could sooner pass through the eye of a needle than Eulmore's gates. The only way the commonfolk can enter this perverted paradise is if they fulfill the whim of one of the privileged. And so they are picked over like market produce...
Ohoho! What a catch! We'll not be throwing this one back!
Having seen your all-too-obvious charms, we welcome you with open arms! Come, join us in the city of splendor, and live out your life in an ecstasy of endeavor!
Ah, just look at those expectant faces! What could you possibly be waiting for!?
Well, well, what have we here!? An extra share of meol to celebrate our newest resident!
For you.
Ah, at last!
Enjoy!
