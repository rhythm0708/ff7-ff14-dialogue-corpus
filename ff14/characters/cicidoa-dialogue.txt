You're an adventurer, yes? If you're not otherwise occupied, I've a favor to ask. I've resolved to repay a debt of gratitude, which I owe to the owner of the Coffer & Coffin.
For this purpose, I've purchased from the Royal Plantations a prodigiously plump pumpkinâ”€a particularly popular piece of produce.
Alas, I cannot part this place to procure and proffer the pumpkin. You see, the scheduled shipment from the Nanawa Mines, for which I wait, is late.
I would prevail upon you to pick up the pumpkin in my stead, and see it safely to the Coffer & Coffin. Present this receipt of purchase to Gagari at the Royal Plantations, and she will yield it to you.
I apologize for asking you to attend to this time-consuming task, but I truly appreciate your assistance!
