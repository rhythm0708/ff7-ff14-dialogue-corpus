She must have been. To still remember her...is strange, isn't it, darling?
I miss her. She would always cheer me up when I was down.
But even though I remember her, I'll never see her again? That doesn't make sense!
It seems that's what it means to die, I'm afraid.
But...but what will happen to us? Are we just going to be sad forever?
