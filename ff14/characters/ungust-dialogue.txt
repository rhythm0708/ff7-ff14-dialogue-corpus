<belch> Well, gods be damned! You're that bloody adventurer who threatened me back in Ul'dah! What in the seven hells do you want with me now!?
“Dear friend... <belch> Missing people... Please help... <hiccup> Yours, Isembard.”
Folk around here are as wary as they come. They'll turn tail and run if you so much as pass wind nearby. Played them all for fools and coaxed some hard labor out of them, I did.
If anything, they're even more timid than before, what with all the disappearances. You can go talk to 'em yourself if you don't believe me.
