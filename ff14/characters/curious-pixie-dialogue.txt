Helping us grow flowers, are you? They'll make this house look so much lovelier!
There used to be a city of mortals here. A great big, bustling place called Voeburt or Boevurt or some such. But the sin eaters came and everyone disappeared.
Since then, we pixies have been living here, and we've given the old houses our touch. Lovely, don't you think?
