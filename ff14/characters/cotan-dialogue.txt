When we were young, my friends and I could scarcely wait to challenge Bardam's Mettle. We longed to become warriors...
The day came and went, but we rarely fought men. Mostly beasts. And now we must stand against the Oronir and the Dotharl. You have seen themâ”€taken the measure of them. Do you believe we can win?
Yes...yes! 'Twas the gods' will that we fight. Surely it is their will that we win! Of course!
No, it will not...but it is well that you acknowledge it. A warrior must be brave, but not foolhardy. I will not forget.
Ah, it is you. The one who helped the children with their chores. For that I must thank you.
Though mayhap I will repay the favor in battle. Yes, I too will fight in the Naadam, though you may not see me. While you and yours contest the ovoo, my comrades and I will devote our efforts to preventing other tribes from interfering.
We are few, and we are weak, but we shall do what we can to aid you. Go well, traveler, and if it be the gods' will, let us speak again when the day is done.
