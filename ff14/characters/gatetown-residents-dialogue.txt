...
Oh, mercy me! The meol! We almost took our leave without leaving a loving token!
We must empty the sacks ere we make our way back!
Redemption is beyond us.
The lament of all but saints and fools...and the comfort of the lords and ladies of this accursed place.
Once, they held fast against the madness, only to embrace the coming cataclysm and delight in the end of days.
Perhaps in rapture they seek to lose themselves and the misery they share...
Or perhaps for them alone the promise of eternal pleasure really does hold true.
Welcome, welcome, to the city of final pleasures! Feel free to weep at its magnificence! ...No? Not even a single tear? Moving right along, then!
Our first task is to register you as residents─you know, make it all nice and official. We'll smooth the way, so you just need to put on your happy faces and head through to Joyous Hall.
The Bureau of Immigration is in the first room on the left side of the passage. Declare your name and occupation in a nice loud voice─the clerks will tell you where to go from there.
Oh, and pay no mind to those folk off to the side of the road. Much like the hopefuls in Gatetown, they haven't earned the right to enter the city proper.
If, however, you enjoy basking in the envy of your fellow man, then by all means...take your time. But why waste another moment? Go! Enjoy the beginning of your new life in paradise!
