Grrr! Grooo!
Grrr! Grooo!
Trust me, Peatie'll love havin' you aboard. Now's our chance to get these eggs into the hands of the eager Gridanians.
She's too timid to wander off on her own, so if somethin' else demands your attention, she'll make her way back to me. Now get out there, and give Gridania an egg surprise!
Ah, there you are. Peatie's itchin' to show her stuff to Gridania's citizens, so just hop right back on her whenever you're ready.
