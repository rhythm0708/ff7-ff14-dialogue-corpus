Ah, honored Scions! You are free to enter at your leisure!
As I cannot leave my post, I'm afraid you must make your own way.
Should you require directions in the city, the sentry stationed at the fountain atop the steps should be glad to assist you.
Though I have been to Radz-at-Han before, this place is a veritable maze.
Rather than risk getting lost, we had best ask for directions from this sentry at the fountain.
Lead the way...and don't expect me to act as your tour guide like certain others.
First, we should seek out the sentry in front of the fountain.
...Name of the fountain? No idea. Do fountains normally have names?
Lost your way, I take it. Hardly surprising in this maze of a city. Best return to where we started.
Found your bearings, have you? Then let's get going to Meghaduta.
