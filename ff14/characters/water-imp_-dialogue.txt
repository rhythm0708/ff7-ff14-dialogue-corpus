Squee-hee-hee!
Some manner of greeting, I presume. Though its cries are convincing, that impish form appears to be naught more than a well-crafted guise.
<sigh> Indeed... An imitation, and nothing more.
We have found the source of the rumors, but... “Saucer Imps Unmasked: Just Normal Men and Women in Costume”? Why, that sounds more to me like a waste of good ink!
It's unacceptable! Worthless! Unfit for consumption!
Gods, I grow drowsy just thinking about writing such a thing. Our readership would be appalled!
Fortunately, there is another curious lead that I wish to pursue. In doing so, we may frame our story around the current festivities, then recount the role of the imps within them... Yes, that might suffice!
You see, as I awaited your arrival, I questioned the attendant at the front desk as to the imps' origins. Strangely enough, I was told that only a select few staff members were present in the planning stages of this affair, and fewer still know who proposed the initial idea.
I was, however, informed that a staff member on the floor─a man attending to an imp─may have the information we seek. If we split up and search the Saucer, we're bound to find him.
I shall leave Wonder Square to you. Let us reconvene here when our rounds are complete.
