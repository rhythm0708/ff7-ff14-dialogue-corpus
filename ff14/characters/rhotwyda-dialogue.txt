That Gurcant's got a head of cabbage if he thinks I'm fetchin' him any blackloam!
But if you dare to pinch some from the Cookpot, then be my guest. Just mind you don't get trampled upon by the aurochs that dwell there.
Once you've three bushels' worth, take the blackloam to Pfrewahl at Tiller's Rest. He'll know what to do.
