Phew... Nothing gets me heated quite like the summer sun!
The monster was just here, I swear it! It was leering at me from behind that rock, making these off-kilter little motions, and then it ran off to the east!
I thought for certain it would come over here and...oogh, I feel faint! I need to go lie down...
Damn... I didn't stand a chance against that thing!
You should have seen it! I was minding my own business out here, practicing my steps, when suddenly that thing showed up out of nowhere to challenge me to a dance-off! Then, after it utterly trounced me, it raced off again!
Would that I could tell you where, or even which direction. Although, come to think of it, I believe I saw something fall from its body.
Well, it doesn't much matter to me anymore. I can hear summer's call, and it must be heeded! To the ocean with me!
Whatever fell off the thing, you'll find it lying over there, if you think it will help your search.
Aha! There shehe is!
You there! Might you be the adventurer Haermaga consigned to the security detail? Worry notâ”€the chaperones are here to help!
Glad as ever to see you again, Forename! Haermaga told us you might be in need of urgent assistance, so here we are!
