Well met and welcome, adventurer. What brings you to this frozen corner of the realm?
Oh? It would seem your companion has caught a chill. Come and warm yourself by the fire. I will bring you a hot broth.
How are we feeling now, then? Stay here as long as you need.
The same goes for you, friend. 'Tis plain you have a hard journey ahead of you. You must find rest when you can.
I'm fine now, thanks to you, but I can't bear to think that Biggs is still all alone in the cold, with Garleans on his heels.
He lured the enemy away for my sake, and now he's suffering for it. I hate to have to rely on you again, Forename, but do you think you could search for Biggs?
I haven't the slightest notion where he might be at the moment, but maybe─just maybe─the people here have seen something.
A Roegadyn gentleman dressed in the same manner as your companion? I'm sorry, but he did not come by here. Hmmm, let me think a moment...
I would not raise your hopes unduly, but there is a cave situated a short distance to the south. We call it the Fury's Gaze, and it may be worth the while to investigate.
I make this suggestion only because your friend seems like a selfless sort. Rather than drawing the enemy to this tower, mayhap he elected to pass us by.
Forename! Were you able to learn anything!?
...Not in this area? Well, that stands to reason, I suppose, seeing as he was trying to lure the Garleans away from me. But where within this vast sea of snow and ice could he be?
We can't give up, Forename! We must find Biggs before he succumbs to the cold or is recaptured!
There must be someone in this tower who can help us, even if it's only to tell us where else to look!
Ask them for me! Ask anyone who'll listen! And hurry! Biggs's chances of survival grow slimmer by the moment!
