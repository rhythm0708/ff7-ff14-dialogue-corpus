Not soon enough, Khatun. The Naadam is nearly upon us! Mayhap we should counsel restraint until after...
I do not understand. If Geser is dead, how should he “return”?
Silence. You come to spy on us knowing naught of our ways?
We know you are fearless. And that you are called the “undying ones”...
That is true. None are braver than the Dotharl, for we do not fear death.
With death a warrior must dance boldly. Fearlessly. For thus does his soul burn bright.
Then, in death, his soul shines white─exalted. The flesh rots, but the soul endures. And ere the seasons have turned, so he shall return.
When he is glimpsed in the eyes of a newborn, he is blessed with the same name, that he may grow into a great warrior once more.
You mean to tell me these newborn babes and fallen warriors are one and the same? Madness!
I gave you leave to observe. Not to insult our beliefs.
Have care what you say. Otherwise, do as you will.
Such contempt as was in their eyes I have never known... But for the soul to live on as they say is not something I can so easily accept.
Do they truly believe this? All of them? That in death there can be rebirth? ...Retribution?
...In any event, we came here in search of information. We cannot leave without speaking with her people.
I know you! Reunion! The travelers with the Mol girl!
I marked you after I left the Oronir. Ones from Doma, others I could not place.
My name is Koko. Welcome to Dotharl Khaa.
Hm? Koko sounds to your ear the name of a woman? Well, of course. That would be because it is.
I died a woman and was reborn a man. It is of no moment─the soul is the soul, and the flesh the flesh.
Perhaps you scoff? Many would. Many look only to the name and the flesh, and let these things dictate their perceptions.
Consider Sadu Khatun. Three times before she died a man, yet she returns as a woman the fourth. Yet she is no less fierce, and any outsider foolish enough to think so will learn the truth to their peril.
