Halone, grant me strength! There must be some way toâ”€ Oh, who are you? A friend of Lord Haurchefant?
I want to help you, I truly do! But these accusations of heresy have thrown House Haillenarte into chaos. Right now, we must focus on combating these charges and preserving our reputation.
I gather you have been busy since last we spoke. Lord Haurchefant's missive was positively glowing. But if you think that his endorsement is cause for me to disregard Ishgardian policies, then you are sorely mistaken.
We are at war, madam, and the enemy grows bolder by the day. Why, in the short time since Inquisitor Guillaime arrived in Coerthas, countless heretics have been discovered, even amongst the elite of Ishgardian society!
If Lord Haurchefant wishes to waste his days chasing after a long-lost airship, then that is his choice. But if he expects others to share in his folly, then he is truly blind to the present state of affairs.
By your countenance, I take it you did not learn anything of use.
Nor did I, I fear. It seems the whole of Coerthas is consumed by this talk of heretics in the High Houses. We can only hope that my sources in Ishgard proper provide more pertinent information.
I had another personal request to make of you. It concerns Lord Francel, of whom much has been whispered in recent days. I have received a report that he and three knights were seen heading north towards the Steel Vigil.
The outpost was long ago overrun by the Dravanian Horde, so I am not certain what he intends to accomplish with such a small force.
Whatever his motives, I fear for his safety. Pray journey to the Steel Vigil and see if Lord Francel's party requires assistance.
Who goes there!? Forename!? No, stay back! The fiend is still here!
