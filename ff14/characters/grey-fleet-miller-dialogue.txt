Trachtoum? You in here drinking again? If you are, that goobbue had better be dead!
Oh, it's dead, chief, ye have me word on that! Cleaved the beast's skull in two with me trusty axe, I did!
Is that a fact? And what will your friend here say if I ask her?
Sh-She'll vouch for me, of course! Ain't that right...friend?
Tell me true: was it Trachtoum who slew that goobbue...or was it you?
Chief! Wh-What are ye sayin'!? It's me, Trachtoum, the finest axeman ever to serve in the Company of Heroes, the legendary mercenaries who slew that bastard Tidus!
...Tidus? Tidus? Who in the seven hells is Tidus!? Some primal you fought in a drink-sodden dream? The Company of Heroes slew Titan, you bloody half-wit!
Ah. Aye, well...see, Tidus was what me an' the lads used to call him.
That's the biggest load of Sahagin shite I've ever heard.Both of you, outside! We'll learn the truth the Lominsan way!
  			 Trachtoum─if you didn't slay that goobbue, you may consider your contract revoked!
