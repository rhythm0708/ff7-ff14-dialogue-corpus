The craftsmanship is exquisite, is it not? And you will be pleased to know that the pledge has just expired.
I should be glad to sell it to you...assuming you have the coin. This is no ordinary weapon, you understand, and it is priced accordingly. But if you are serious, I suggest you act quickly, as several noted collectors have already expressed an interest.
Hmm... The blade represents conclusive proof of Gosetsu's survival. I suppose this could be considered a necessary cost in securing his safe return...Yet it is not a decision I can make alone─least of all when our nation has scarce begun to rebuild.
Nay, my friend. Grateful though I am for the offer, I cannot ask this of you. It is enough to know that Gosetsu is alive and well.
Yugiri, wait. The Scions will buy the katana. Pray consider it a gift.
M-Master Alphinaud, your kindness is touching, truly. Yet, in matters of coin, would Mistress Tataru not expect to be consulted?
Come now. Our friend would never have relinquished his blade were the need not great. And are we not bound by honor to help a friend in need? I say we are─and I am sure Tataru will wholeheartedly agree.
It's settled, then! You have made a wise choice, my friend─such pieces are few and far between! Now, if you would be so good as to come this way, I shall prepare the necessary papers.
If I may ask, sir, after he visited your establishment, do you perchance know where the old samurai went? He is our friend, and we would return his weapon to him.
A friend of yours, you say? I see. Well then, I suppose there can be no harm in telling you. No sooner had I provided him with the requested sum than his pretty young companion began clamoring for dango. I duly recommended those served at the Umineko Teahouse, and thither did they set off.
...Clamoring for dango? Can these truly be the same people? It makes no sense.
Some manner of code, perhaps. But it avails us naught to speculate. Let us go to this teahouse and see if we can pick up their trail.
