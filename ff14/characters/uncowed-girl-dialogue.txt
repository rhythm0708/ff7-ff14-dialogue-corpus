Don't tell me you're supposed to send a chill down my spine. Clowns are for babies!
For babies, are they? Hehehe, I'll make this lass wish she was back in her mother's womb!
You there, little girl. Look well upon this pumpkin.
Aaah! A m-m-monster!
Ah...hah hah... Wh-What impressive magic! My heart won't stop pounding.
Da and Ma will have the fright of their life when I tell them I saw a real, honest-to-gods monster. I can't wait to tell them!
Haha, I'll think twice before I insult a clown again. Thank you for the thrills!
Did she say, “Thank you”?
I scared her near out of her shoes, and she thanks me? Can't say I've experienced that before.
I daresay I even enjoyed it! Yes, now is the time to capitalize upon this newfound “tickling” skill of mine. Let us visit the display near the Whistling Miller next.
Good day to you, young lady. Might you join me in celebrating the joyous occasion that is All Saints' Wake?
