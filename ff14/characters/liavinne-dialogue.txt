Bwahahaha! Edda, you're so slow, you'd lose a footrace to a tree slug.
Please tell me you're here on Yellowjacket duty, and not some daft sod out for a stroll. I can't take any more of this blasted waiting. You are? Thank the gods.
I assume you already know about the ship seen slipping around the Isles of Umbra?
We've been on the lookout for pirate activity ever since that vessel was sighted, thinking a crew of cutthroats might have a den nearby.
So when we received word that men of questionable quality had been seen passing in and out of Sastasha here, we weren't entirely surprised.
I've yet to see them for myself, but if this lot belongs to those fishback-fancying Serpent Reavers...
Well, you can imagine the panic it'll cause. The kidnappings are still fresh in people's minds.
Anyway, your task is to poke around in the caves, and find out exactly who we're dealing with. While you do that, I'll be keeping watch out here...praying you don't spot any blue face tattoos.
The fishbacks and their Serpent Reaver lackeys cannot be allowed to establish a permanent base in these lands.
You must uncover the truth behind who or what is lurking in these caves, adventurer. The peace of western La Noscea may depend on it!
